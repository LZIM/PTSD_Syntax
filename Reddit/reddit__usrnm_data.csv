PTSD,"Last year at Halloween, BM pulled the rug out from under us. Kiddo wanted to be Jack Frost, so we bought and decorated her costume together. She was so excited. And at the last minute, BM announces ""oh no, she's being a princess this year! She's had her dress for a month! Besides, you had her last year.""

It was our weekend. BM never said anything about it until the last minute. Kiddo cried, and when we picked her up after trick or treating, the poor kid looked like a prostitute. Just covered in glitter and makeup in a too-large dress that slid off her shoulder and was awkward to walk in. I felt terrible-- angry and frustrated and powerless. Nobody cared about what Kiddo wanted, or the time and money I'd invested, and I had to suck it up and be the adult and not make a thing of it. Fine.

This year, my husband tells me she wants to be this or that for Halloween and then acts confused when I say that I'd rather not participate this year.

The girls say I'm being selfish, depriving Kiddo somehow. Her dad will get her dressed up and take her out. How is that depriving her? Why am I as an adult not allowed to want to go to a party with other adults while my husband takes his child out? 
My feelings are still hurt from last year. I don't want to grump up Kiddo's holiday, and I don't want to have to push down my perfectly valid emotions for the eleventeenth holiday in a row.  I don't want to have to eat another shit sandwich and act like it's delicious. Why is that selfish?",DiffidentDissident

PTSD,"I just found my 6-year-old stepdaughter's bed liberally splashed with what can only be vomit from the last time she was here, two. full. weeks. ago. She never said a word, just covered it up with whatever was available.

It's in the sheets. It's in the blankets. It's in the pillows. It's covered in mold. *The cat has had access to it this whole time.*

And the kid never said a single word to us about it. Her bedroom is upstairs while the rest of the household is downstairs, and we never go in when she's not here, so we had no idea she'd been sick. It's just been *moldering* for *two weeks.*

I have to laugh about this or I'll cry. I'm sure she was worried about being in trouble or whatever, and it's fine, she's obviously not, but OH, THE CLEANUP.

PTSD,"...did my 6yo stepdaughter sleep on the lovely new lavender sheets we gave her for Christmas before getting BLACK marker on them?


*If you guessed ""once,"" you win!*

She's so lucky I found it right at bedtime. I can't wig out on her right before bed, but *ohhh, I want to.* She knows better than to color on her bed. She KNOWS better! She's usually so responsible with her art supplies!

But... she's six.

She's not remotely mature enough to understand half the reasons it upsets me, though, so rather than go on about the expense and disrespecting her possessions, I just told her that we know she knows better than to color on her brand new sheets and that we expect her to NEVER make this mistake again. She nodded, but I got the impression she didn't take it very seriously. I really hope she was listening and doesn't do this again.

It's just marker. I keep telling myself it's just marker. She's just a little kid and kids do dumb things. But boy, does it get under my skin. I feel like maybe it's easier for me to get angry at her because she's not biologically mine, but I don't have any frame of reference to determine whether that's true. I find myself rehearsing situations in which I have to discipline her (as I'm the primary caregiver when she's here due to her dad's schedule), because I worry that I'll get too wound up and lose my temper if I don't prepare ahead of time. (By ""lose my temper"" I mean raise my voice or slam a door. I'm not into physical discipline.) I worry constantly that I'll take out my typical stepparent frustrations (with her Dad or her mom or simply the inconvenience of switching gears from adult household to kid household every single weekend) on her. And that would make me feel even worse.

BUT FOR THE LOVE OF LITTLE APPLES, KID, QUIT COLORING ON THE BEDSHEETS!",DiffidentDissident
PTSD,"""The reward you get for digging holes is a bigger shovel.""

I'm through putting in so much effort with this child. I'm burnt out and I'm angry. I feel like I'm being used. She just wants and wants and takes and takes and no one ever asks what I might need.

I've spent the last month gathering and purchasing pieces for the child's Halloween costume. She told us what she wanted to be and I made it happen, JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR. We always take her trick or treating in her grandparents' development. 

Last night her dad tells me that BIOMOM has unilaterally decided to take her kids trick or treating for the first time EVER, and Kiddo has had her costume for weeks. WEEKS! And not once did ANYONE think to mention it to us! Trick or treat night is on one of OUR nights with her, so why on earth would we think anything would be different from previous years?

And my husband has the nerve to be upset with me for being angry. I just started an exhausting full time job--where I've ALREADY been promoted--  and every single one of my days off is spent watching HIS child while he works, all so he can spend two hours doing nothing and barely interacting with her in front of the tv in the evening. You know what? Fuck that. I'm through. 

I'm through buying paints and toys and driving to the park and setting up play dates and losing sleep. I'm through teaching someone else's kid not to pick her nose or show the world her underwear. I'm through missing out on things because I have to watch his kid more hours in a week than he does. HE DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE HOURS THAN I DO. WHY IS THIS FALLING ON ME.

From now on, he can take her home at night or her grandparents can watch her while he works. There's a REASON I never had any kids. I don't WANT TO BE responsible for all of this. I'm sick of being used, taken for granted, and made to sacrifice all of my ME time for nothing. I'm done.",DiffidentDissident

He listens to me explain that I splurged on THIS specific food as a treat for myself, and then he gives it to her. He keeps me awake all night snoring and elbowing me in the head, and then tells me I shouldn't have married a man with kids if I didn't want to live on next-to-no sleep and throw away every one of my days off work babysitting.

PTSD,"Holidays are uniformly horrible, traumatic experiences. I consider them the price I have to pay for all the good, regular days I get to spend with my husband during the rest of the year.

""Sure, honey, let's get the kiddo on Christmas morning again this year, and spend all day running around to OUR house and your PARENTS' house and your EXTENDED FAMILY'S gathering and let's never, ever, EVER even consider attending one of MY family's holiday get-togethers! 

It's cool, I didn't want to see my grandmother on Christmas/her NINETY-FIFTH (and probably last) birthday. I didn't want to spend the holidays around the handful of remaining family members I've got. I didn't want to spend Christmas doing LITERALLY ANYTHING other than driving around from place to place with your child, awkwardly watching her be given gifts that she'll never use, and playing nice with people you've never bothered to introduce me to! 

Don't you just LOVE that moment-- long after my quiet words to you about it being time to go home now-- when she's finally hit overload and melts down loudly and publicly, crying and hollering, and won't let anybody but ME calm her down? Don't you just LOVE that?!""

Being a stepmother around Christmas makes me want to jump off the roof. I hate it. My husband simply will not consider having a quiet family Christmas at our house. ""But everybody wants to see her!"" And of course, it's more important to make ""everybody"" (in HIS family) happy than it is to keep his wife sane. The kid wouldn't care-- her mother's set it up so that EVERY YEAR, kiddo wakes up at her Mom's house and has Christmas morning there. How many Christmases does one child need?!

All kiddo wanted for Christmas was ""a kitty!"" So we took in a cat that my friend was too sick to care for anymore. (A cat that is currently licking all of the fur off her body and vomiting it back up on the rugs.) I love our new cat, despite her growing list of issues and the inevitably huge vet bills we're going to be facing. You'd think that would be enough, but NOOOOOOPE. Daddy needed a bunch of things for kiddo to unwrap on Christmas, because *I guess the gifts from her mother's side, her paternal grandparents, and her entire extended paternal family won't be enough THINGS for one 5-year-old.* So there's a bunch more crap to pay off on the credit card now, because again, god forbid I suggest that our little princess has quite enough *stuff.* The last time I mentioned it, he looked at me as though I'd suggested we put the kid up on eBay. The child has an entire *room* dedicated to her stupid toys! She doesn't need more toys! We have a *living, breathing animal* for her to play with while she's here, which ought to be enough-- and guess who gets to scoop poop twice a day and clean up vomit & hairballs all week while Kiddo's *not* here? Last night she woke me up *three times* with the puking. I love my cat, but I didn't really need more thankless work in my life. Vet appointment Monday-- another bill, incoming!

I volunteered for this, because we *all* stand to benefit from Kiddo's increased presence in our home. It's a big responsibility. I'm a little nervous, but also really excited for lots of reading and cooking and games with her. She kicks my ass at Candyland even if I take out all the special cards.

PTSD,"Lately I've seen a lot of posts by people who don't believe they ""deserve"" their diagnosis, or haven't ""earned"" it, somehow. This upsets me. It makes me feel deeply sad.

I was first diagnosed 16, almost 17 years ago. I asked my therapist ""...from what?"" He replied, ""From your life."" I was a high-school kid-- not a soldier or a cop or an EMT. I was just a kid who'd grown up in what amounted to a small-scale war zone, and I was traumatized by it.

Does this mean that I didn't earn my diagnosis? That because my trauma and hypervigilance and triggers were caused by my home life, that I haven't earned the right to treatment? That only soldiers can soldier on, that only warriors fight wars, that only police have to police their own thoughts? Would you condemn me to a life without proper treatment and proper care, just because my PTSD grew slowly, over the course of years, rather than springing fully-formed from my head after one single incident?

No, of course not. We who suffer can be so much more forgiving of others than ourselves. ""Of course you 'deserve' your diagnosis! You *have* PSTD!"" That's right. And so do you. 

A diagnosis of PTSD or PTSS isn't automatically a badge of honor, something that only heroes can get. It isn't a death sentence, either.  It's merely a way to identify and treat what's happening to us, inside us. 

Schizophrenia has been described as ""a sane reaction to an insane world."" (RD Laing) I think that we could view PTSD the same way: our worlds went insane for a minute, a day, a year, a childhood, and our sane brains had to be flexible in order to cope, to *endure.* If you endured, and you lived, then you deserve to be properly diagnosed and treated. *No one* ""deserves"" PTSD.

I hope you can all be more forgiving of yourselves, and embrace your diagnoses in hopes of treating them and bringing sanity back to your worlds.

So my former employer hired two employees I referred to them, and the owner decided that even though I'm not an employee he still wants to pay me the referral bonus of $500 per referral, so $1000 total. 

The thing is, he said since I'm not an employee he'll have to issue a 1099 for it and advised me to make sure I withhold the proper amount for taxes. 

Here's my question; 

I'm a W2 employee elsewhere, who make $57K a year, single and no dependents. What should I expect with this? It will affect me in CY 2016 (so paying taxes in 2017).

I just want to make sure I do this right.

When you're staring at the Excel sheet, or YNAB, or whatever your tracking tool is (I hope you have one) and you just feel defeated and don't see an end to the madness.

Come up with a plan and just stick to it! Just keep chugging along and things will happen, and you just have to react and keep going following that plan, adjust, and keep going.

Today I was finally approved to refinance my auto loan.

A 2011 sedan that I owe just under $11K on and after divorce I was left with a 16.9% APR... $310 payment, and it was killing me!

But I stood fast on selling the house, and paying other stuff down, and finally a local CU approved me today for refinance at 8%!!! Cut my rate in half! I can't wait to update my plan with this change, I can divert the ""extra"" that I won't be paying to the higher APR % debt now until that's paid off even faster!

So don't give up... let us help you if you're overwhelmed, this community has kept me going financially and has always granted me with straight to the point and honest advice!

I have an auto loan with $10.9K left on balance, auto is blue book slightly below that, and it's not going anywhere so don't bother with any of that, I'm here for a specific thing. 

with a rate of 16.9% I'd love to refinance, but last time I tried I was denied due to high credit/debt ratio.

Well I sold my house in another state so mortgage shows paid now.

I still have $22K credit card debt slowly being paid down, $3.7K personal loan being paid down, and $5K in student loans deferred.

I owned a house in New York and rented it out from January to August, after paying mortgage and property management it was $27/month I took in, so $216 total for the year.

When it came time to sell the house for which I paid $147,000 (loan for $152,000), it sold for $153,750 which was enough for paying off mortgage and most of closing costs, but I also had to put in $1,846.27 out of pocket for closing.

And then I'm getting $1,786.79 back from the escrow balance that remained. And I got $950.00 from my bank for using their home buying/selling program. 

So what do I all need to be looking at here?

My rental income would be taxable but that would be offset by repairs completed I think.

I don't think this would be considered a gain on the sale because of what I had to pay out of pocket ($1800) and the escrow refund doesn't offset that does it?

I know the kickback for the sale program ($950) will be considered taxable income but I don't see that being too big of a hit.

Am I missing anything? Is this just going to be a wash and I took a loss, or what do you all think I should be expecting?

So can someone please explain to me so that it's clear....

My employed income is $3,208 monthly. (if I became unemployed this would go away)

My disability income is $1,409 monthly. (this won't go away short of a national government failure so... I count it as guaranteed.)

Expenses.

What do you include here? Everything to include minimum debt payments. Just like we usually list it all out?

If that's the case; $4,300 monthly expenses

Am I really supposed to just keep making minimum payments on debt until I have at least the $12,900 saved up?

So... $758.85... well I called the billing office prepared to set up a payment plan. I asked the nice lady who picked up if they offered a discount for full payment. She says they do, 30%.

I don't know; I really just want to be totally debt free but I get a bit panicky thinking about going the next 24 months without an e-fund, for some reason starting it in 18 months makes me feel better.",SCRIZZLEnetwork

Really? Because watching an adult male cart-wheel through the air after getting hit by a cement truck, while his wife and ~5-6 year old child get crushed by the truck isn't worthy of PTSD? Having to re-live that on an at least weekly basis isn't worthy of PTSD?

PTSD,"Going to save some time and say that I've been through here enough that I mostly know what to do here, but want some validation from my fine fellow redditors on /r/PersonalFinance

I had a projected wind-fall of back pay for VA Disability I was expecting later this fall, well they worked much faster than I anticipated and I got it today.

$6550.00 lump sum and I'll now get an additional $180 per month as well.

Here's what I'm looking at.

Step 1. Payoff private loan of $4,382.72 (23.74%), payment $170 per month.

Step 2. Choose between the following:

CC 1 - Pay toward balance of $9,968 at 16.4%, $320/month

CC 2 - Pay toward balance of $2,912 at 13.9%, $65/month

The reason I'm even considering CC 2 is because after paying of the loan I will have ~$2100 left, and if I apply that to CC 2 I could have it paid off entirely in the next 4-6 months, freeing up an addtional $65 a month I can put toward CC 1 on top of the extra $180 and the $170 from the loan payment ($415 total), whereas if I put that $2100 toward CC 1, it'll reduce the balance but won't free up the extra $65 to pay it down faster.

I guess I honestly know what the right to do is, just put it toward CC 1 in the usual High%First method, but I thought maybe in this unique situation y'all might feel differently about it.",SCRIZZLEnetwork

I've met wife's new significant other and honestly believe he is a super great man for her. From what she has said and what I see, he treats her very well and I'm honestly very happy for them!

I've also watched him interact with our daughter and I don't have any problems there either.

Because of how my ex-wife and I would like to co-parent, her new S/O and I will need to get along or it will just make the whole situation awkward and unbearable on one or both sides. And my goal is to keep it all the best I can for my daughter.

So the real meat of this... because my ex-wife has shared her history with him, which includes our history, he already has a bit of a reluctance towards me. Not like a hatred at all, just a hesitation. 
After talking to my ex-wife on this I think this is the situation. 

He and I need to build a level of trust between us. He needs to earn my trust that him being around my daughter is not in any way bad for her. And I guess I need to earn his trust that I'm not going to be making ex-wife's life a living hell or trying to steal her away (I have no intentions of either).

So Reddit, what do you think? Any tips on how to proceed forward. And please, if you're going to ramble on about how I need to just stay out of their relationship just save your text... I'm here for exactly what I've talked about... how to have a positive friendly relationship with ex-wife's new S/O in order to maintain the best possible co-parenting arrangement I can for my daughter.

4.09% and 53 payments left. 

Her attorney told her to attempt to refinance it.

She got a best rate of 9.9% and would need to extend the term back to 60 months to roughly keep the same payment.

The attorney told her that because it's considered to be detrimental to her finances she can draft a letter releasing me from liability and right to the property (the car) and the judge will approve it and they will provide it to the lender who then has to remove me from the title and stop reporting to my credit file, but still maintain the same APR% and payment terms.

1 of 5 credit cards - the highest is $9,813.27 @ 16.4% (currently paying $350/month)

Here are a few precursors... as to what we ""reddit"" already knows that can't be changed at the moment.

My full budget has been previously posted. The car can't just be sold and downgraded because I don't have equity nor cash to buy a new one at the moment. Also, I got hit by another driver so value is likely much lower because of the repair record being on carfax.

PTSD,"So some background [TRIGGER ALERT]... I was deployed to Qatar in 2011. During this time I frequently drove in to the city of Doha and let me tell you, that traffic was horrendous, the worst I've ever been in. Often times, 3 lane roads would be 4-5 lanes, and cars would travel on the medians or along the sides of the road. Also, the bigger your car the more right-of-way you had.

Well one day I was driving along their main road (a 3 lane) and some civilians (2 adults and a child) ran in to the street to cross and a very large truck (think Middle East dumptruck) swerved in their direction instead of away from them and hit them all. The child was crushed by the tire, one adult was somersaulted in to the air, and I don't really know what happened to the third but I know they were hit. 

One of the worst part's about this is that I couldn't stop, I had to keep driving.

When I returned home my friends noted that I was very distant and detached, especially while in the car. During the year after this event I was involved in 4 auto accidents, all which could have been avoided had I only reacted in time, but I would freeze up.

It got so bad in the second year that I couldn't even drive and at one point, I couldn't even be in the car unless I shut my eyes for the entire ride. 

Thankfully I had met a very mentally/emotionally strong woman during that first year, we ended up married and had a child, and with her help I was able to overcome much of my triggers and am now driving again!

C: ""See, we are from Minnesota but we are just passing through Arkansas and are heading back. So you *have* to honor the clothing tax exempt rule since Minnesota would honor it. I've had people in other states honor the rule in the past""

Me: ""Ma'am, I can't just not charge you tax. These taxes go to Arkansas. Once again, you are buying something while you are in Arkansas so you have to pay the taxes set by Arkansas.""

C: ""Well this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. (calls to friend) Can you BELIEVE they won't honor this?!""

Most frustrating conversation of my life.",thatonechick33
PTSD,"(This is super long)

You know, I've never fully revealed on here why I have PTSD. I've just given the gist. But let me tell you my story, and why don't you tell me if I can ""Just get over it"" and ""my ptsd is not real ptsd""

My story starts with my high school sweetheart. Together since 16 and we married as soon as I turned 18. But when we got married, things started to change. Little things. He would become jealous when he wasn't previously a jealous person. He started to be controlling. Then he started to get angry. Then one day, I don't remember the reason, but it was when the physical violence started. He choked me until I passed out. I thought maybe this was a one time thing. But no. Stupid scared and naive 18yo me wanted to make a marriage work. His jealously became worse and he stared to hit me when we argued, over the most trivial things I might add (like who ate the last doughnut), he would hit me for that too. He'd grab my arm so hard there'd be bruises where his fingers were pressing. He constantly tried to convince me that we should kill ourselves together. 

Then, 3 months into our marriage, I had the worst experience of my life. He had gotten mad at me for spending too long over at a friends house and accused me of seeing another guy there. So he put me in ""the hole"". In our house, there was a loose board in the stairs that you could pry open, revealing the ground underneath the stairs. He put me in the hole and the other stair boards were nailed in, I was too short to reach the lose one. He left me in there for 3 days with no light. He would only open the board to throw water and granola bars at me, and occasionally try to urinate on me. I sat in that hole in the corner for 3 days and nights. I screamed but no one could hear. Finally, he pulls up the board and pulls me out. He tells me to get cleaned up and hurry, I have 10 minutes. It turns out, my parents had just called him and said they were coming to stay the weekend with us. I was too scared to tell them and I am ashamed of that. 

The night they left, I asked him if he would get off of the computer so I could use the phone to call my (gay) best friend (we had dialup). He then became angry. He flipped the computer table and it fell to the ground. He accused me of cheating on him with my gay friend, that he wasnt really gay and that we had been having an affair and playing him for a fool all along.

I had never seen him this angry, so I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. Thankfully my cell phone was in there and I called my gay friend (who lived a block away) And i told him that it was bad and was scared and to get a friend (Brad) to come over and help me. Well husband broke down the bathroom door (he was 6'5 250lbs) and pulled me out to the living room. He told me to sit on the couch while he went to get something. I ran to my room but he caught me before I got there. He dragged me on the floor by my hair back to the living room. He had gotten a shotgun and he pointed it at me and he told me that he was going to kill me and then kill himself. At this moment, (I found out later that my gay friend and Brad had peeked through the window and saw husband with the gun) Brad opens the door really fast. Husband happened to be standing close enough to it that it hit him in the back and it knocked him over. Brad took me by the hand and we left. I have never seen my husband again.

So there is my story of why I have PTSD.  I want you to tell me now if my PTSD isn't ""real"" PTSD because I wasn't in combat.

To the guy who posted, you are a fool. Combat veterans arent the only people in the world that have PTSD. And for you to make a post suggesting that anyone with ""childhood trauma"" doesn't really have PTSD and should just deal with their problems like adults, you make me sick. ",thatonechick33

I am a first time parent and I have never seen my child do this before.

 It started with the juice and now it has moved to bigger things. When she wants to go outside, but it's too cold, I try to explain that to her and she begins hitting her head on the door. I know people make chalk this up to 'terrible 2's', but is this really terrible 2's? Is this what I should be expecting from her from now on? She just turned 2 last week.

Is this behavior normal?

PTSD,"Several months ago, a social worker came by and interviewed my family. I got a copy of her report, and some of the things she says on there are flat out lies and exaggeration. (I'm giving an example: She drug tested me and I failed for opiates, I have a kidney disease and have a prescription for a couple of pain medicines. I showed her the bottles, yet she wrote in the report that I ""failed my drug test but could not provide proof that I was prescribed these medications"". I know that I can easily disprove this with a printout of my pharmacy account and a statement from my doctor, but my point is that this woman lied about something that I can easily disprove, yet she lied anyway. I want to avoid this in the future)

Can I record future interactions with this woman, or a follow up worker? She said she would be back twice more for interviews and drug tests, and I would like to record the interaction between us so that there is no room for her to exaggerate or lie again. Would it be legal for me to record her during my interview, at my home? Would I have to inform her she is being recorded?

Edit: The interview happened in August. I received documentation in the mail that she said the accusations against me were true. The accusations were that I was abusing my medications. Which, again, can be easily disproved when reviewing my pharmacy records. My state has that database where it automatically tells you if I am 'doctor shopping'. Also, my pharmacy account will show that I don't get my medicine early or anything like that. I'm not too worried about that part of it because I can very easily disprove what was said. I am freaking out about the fact that this woman marked this claim as TRUE because of *her* findings, which was based off the fact that I failed a surprise drug test.
Anyways, I filed an appeal as soon as I got the documentation. I also requested the reported that day too. This was in October and I just now got a copy of her report. I was horrified that someone in her position could lie and find an accusation true when I have so much proof that it isn't true. I have a hearing for my appeal in early February, but I have no idea what they will ask me.",thatonechick33

PTSD,"I am a first time mom and my 2yo daughter has been great up until now. She would never throw tantrums, ever.

But now, she tantrums over the smallest things like- I didn't let her pick up our cat- I didn't let her touch my phone-I want her to wear pants ect...

When she throws these tantrums, she lays in the floor, kicking and screaming. Then she bangs her head on the floor. And occasionally she punches or hits herself in the face while throwing a tantrum. I have never seen a child do this before and I have absolutely no idea what to do and how to act/treat her when this happens.

The other day I was at the mall, she was in her stroller but she wanted out. She fussed enough that I let her out and then we walked the mall tantrum-free for a bit.
Then we had to leave and get her to the car. I have never seen my child act the way she did that night. Trying as hard as she could not to be buckled in, squirming, and she even kicked me in the face and chest over and over.

Our home life is great so I do not believe that is a factor.

I worked in perfume/lingerie and one day I was zoned to the perfume section. A lady comes in and says ""I'm looking for something....sweet."" 

I suggested a few scents and sprayed one on the test strip for her. I held it up to her and she pushed my hand away and said ""Oh, no,  I can't smell this because I am allergic to one of the scents and I don't know which one.""

So I tried to get more detail about what exactly she was looking for and time after time she just kept saying it smelled sweet. Which was literally all 30+ fragrances. I told her I couldn't really help her with 0 point of reference and then she said ""Well, can you just smell all of these and describe them to me?""

I stared at her in silence, trying to gauge whether she was serious or not. After a few seconds I realize she was indeed serious and I reluctently picked up 20 test strips and described the smells of about 5 of them before my nose was on fire and I couldn't smell anything anymore.

PTSD,"When I was 17, I was at my boyfriend Tom's house (his dad house) and my bf's dad went to town to get some food, as the house was miles away from town and very secluded. We had just been mudding and I was filthy so I took a shower while my boyfriend watched tv. 

The walls were pretty thin so i could hear that a man came into the house and I could tell by the way Tom was speaking that it wasn't his dad. 

A few minutes later, my bf says he wants to shower with me because the mud was very uncomfortable. About 5 minutes in, we started making out. We made out for a while and then out of the corner of my eye, I see a black flash and then the water got really cold. I didn't think to look out and Tom and I kept kissing after we adjusted the water. 

Tom wanted to sit down so we did and the movement tossed the shower curtain around and I got a glimpse of what was on the other side. Standing there was a large black man staring at us.

 I scream and Tom says ""Man what are you doing here?"" and the guy said ""Just letting you know that I can see your dad driving down the road so you may want to get out of the shower"". Turns out the guy was Tom's dads best friend so Tom knew him. We got out and I was shaking. I tried to get away from him and go to Tom's bedroom but he followed me.

 He asked if he could ""finish me off with his tongue"". I felt sick to my stomach. I was 17 and this guy had to have been in his 40's.It scared me so bad that I ran out of the bedroom and demanded to be taken home.



I didn't realize until recently that this could have ended much worse. A lot of things really bother me about this situation. I have no idea why he would reach in and turn the water to make it colder. And I wonder why my boyfriend didn't take it as seriously as I did. He wasn't creeped out at all.

He lived in a different state and one night he came to my town and got a hotel. He got here really late at night and he only had like 6 hours before I had to leave for work. I told him not to make the drive but he did anyway. When I go to meet him at the hotel, the first thing he does when I walk into the room is hand me two bags and says ""I got you some gifts"". He had this really creepy smile when he said this. I opened the bags and inside were a sex toy and a ball gag. Honestly the gag made me more uncomfortable than the toy. I had never mentioned to him that I was in to any of that stuff and I just feel like you need to talk to your partner about that stuff. Even though we have known each other so long, it wasn't in the sexual sense so our relationship was very green.  

The gifts just made me feel dirty. I have had a vibrator before so I'm not offended by the act. I am offended because it seemed like he only drove all that way for sex. I flat out asked him if he did and he said no. But then I realized that he only had 6 hours before I had to go to work. The drive he made was 9 hours just to spend 6 hours with me. And he brings sex toys. How in the world am I suppose to believe that he wasn't there for sex.

From that moment on, I started looking back at other times and I realized that he was always wanting sex and was a little pressure-y about it. The toys, coupled with the fact that I hadn't even sat down when he gave them to me, just make me feel like I am some sort of sex toy myself.

She was premature and has always been smaller than other kids her age. But, for some reason, her legs are pure muscle. I've never seen a 15 month old have defined muscle like this. It looks like she's been doing leg day every day since she was born! The muscle in her legs is insanely defined. Everyone I see comments on this when they see her. Doctor says it's nothing to be alarmed about and to ""try her out in sports"" when she's older. I think he said it as a joke, but honestly, I am wondering what sport to try her on? 

Of course I would never force something on her if she has no interest. At first I thought swimming, because she can swim extremely well for her age. She is also double jointed in pretty much every joint you can imagine, so then I think gymnastics. 

But she seems to really like dancing. Again, she's only 15 months old! I'm a first time parent, and I am not trying to play up my kid like most people do, but I really think that she can go places.

The premise is about a serial killer who has had amnesia for over 10 years. Suddenly, stuff from his past keeps turning up. It's important to note that, in the entirety of the book, the killer never gets his memory back. This is what I feel makes this different. I have researched this premise to see exactly how ""overdone"" it is. In every instance that I found, the killer got his memory back.

The book is written in a way that I want the reader to try to figure out if they are rooting for this guy, or wanting to see him go down. In the end, when his fate is revealed, I want the reader to think ""how do I feel about that?"" It comes down to- does the reader think that he should have gotten away with his crimes, crimes that he feels like ""someone else committed"", or does the reader think that he should be jailed because that is a sense of 'justice'.

I was working at my retail job, it was a shoe store and up until this point nothing weird happened. I was closing by myself and at 8:30 there were 4 people in the store. A long haired guy and a couple with a kid. I noticed the long haired guy staring at me and not looking at any of the merchandise.

After the family checked out and left, the guy comes up to me right away. He says ""I know this is going to sound weird but can I videotape your feet?"" I laughed because I thought he was joking. I said to him no thanks. He then says that he *loves* the shade of pink nail polish I have on my toenails. He said I had perfect feet and he just had to have a picture or video of them. I was more shocked than anything so I didn't really know what to do.  Long haired guy gets out his phone and starts trying to take pictures. Then I realized that this guy was completely serious.

I told him another associate would be there any minute to help me close (which was a lie) and that I was really uncomfortable and I'd like him to leave. He got really angry and screamed at me that he was trying to compliment me and I didn't have to be so rude. He stormed out the door. 

I closed the store and it was almost 10pm by then (this guy came in at 8:30). I saw that there were 2 cars in the parking lot, mine and an unfamiliar one parked in front of me. I assumed it was another strip mall employee. As I'm walking to my car I noticed someone is in the car across from me. I get to my door and I was trying to open it but when I saw that it was the long haired guy in the other car I got so shaky and I couldn't get the key in the hole to unlock it. I didn't have a thing to make it open automatically because my car was too old to have one. As I'm shaking and scratching the shit out of the keyhole, the long haired guy gets out of his car and makes a few steps toward me. He paused for a second and that was all I needed.

I stayed on for 10 minutes. And then things got creepy. He asked me what I would wear if I were to work for him. I tried to justify that question as being something that would make or break whether or not I got the job. So I told him a business suit or some slacks with a nice shirt. Then he told me that he wanted his secretary to dress sexy. He said his customers enjoyed the sight of a sexy woman and it would help him with business. 
Stupid me didn't hang up because I wanted the job so badly. Then he said ""Would you wear clothes that I bought for you?"" I said ""I guess so......"" He started going into detail, telling me what he wanted me to wear and what lingerie to have on. When he asked if I would wear see through clothes with lingerie that he picked out, I got really uncomfortable and said ""Sir, I think you have the wrong number.""

He said if I didn't want to be his secretary that he would put me up in one of his properties for free in exchange for sexual favors. I screamed ""You definitely have the wrong number!"" As I was about to hang up I heard him say ""But you look so good in that grey suit with your hair in that high ponytail."" 

I hung up, locked the doors to the store and called the police. He described exactly what I was wearing. The police came and they said it was just a prank call. Every time I was at that store I would wonder if the middle aged male customer was the guy. 

I worked there for 2 years and this guy called about every 6 months. I got another call from him after that with the same ruse. ""Oh I think you applied with my company"" he would say. I recognized his voice instantly every time. I would scream ""YOU HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER"" and hang up. I had to warn all new hires about this man and a couple other girls fell for it over the years. 
I shudder to think what could have happened and what could still happen with this guy out there. 

Tl;dr: Guy calls the store I'm working at alone and describes to me what I'm wearing and asks if he could buy me sexy clothes and work as his secretary",thatonechick33

PTSD,"It's kind of a weird period in life, somewhere between being a toddler and a middle schooler, when you start to notice the little foibles of your parents and the things they do that don't make sense or that betray something unsuspected about them. There's something a little scary about it, the things adults do for inscrutable reasons (being a kid was terrifying in general, maybe) and I'm interested in hearing about the dreams of other people who went through this period and maybe got some insights they weren't quite ready for. 

This was mine:

I had a nightmare when I was maybe six years old about my mother. My mom had serious mental problems at the time: there's some kind of familial rage disorder on my mom's side, and she had it *bad*. She had a way of getting angry that was epic, explosive and terrifying, and sometimes it would happen for no good reason at all. It took a lot of figuring out. 

So one night I had a nightmare that I was alone in the house with my mother, it was summertime, and I couldn't find her. I was going from room to room, searching for her: the lights were off, the whole house only lit by the pale light behind the pulled curtains. I was on the edge of panic when I finally came into my childhood bedroom and found my mom there, her back to me, bent over a dresser with her head almost touching it. I couldn't see what she was doing, but it was a weird posture she was in: I called out to her, but she didn't move, didn't turn around. 

I walked across the bedroom toward her, and as I came around her I could see she was struggling with something: she was standing bent over with her head jammed into a fishbowl on top of the dresser. She was gripping the sides of the glass bowl hard enough to turn her hands to white leather: she was wearing a headband, as if she'd been mowing the lawn. Her eyes bugged out at me through the glass, her teeth were bared in rage like a dog's. She had real, absolute hatred on her face. 

I panicked, pulled at her arm and yelled to her, trying to stop her from drowning herself, but I might as well have been invisible. She had her head jammed in that bowl and she was determined to leave it there, and somehow - to blame the self-drowning on me. 

You know, I don't think I ever quite saw my mom the same way after that dream. There was something *helpless*, and self-harmful, about the way she lost her temper, like someone with Tourette's letting out a chain of curses - something helpless about the way she felt about me, about my father and about her life. Whether it was really true or not, it made it a lot easier to hold onto my own sanity and forgive her craziness over the years, that's for sure. ",Sysiphuslove

This was rendered in 3DS Max 2014 using VRay 2; GI is on, subpixel color mapping is on clamped at 1.0 as Intensity Exponential, multipliers of 7 on light and dark. Antialiasing is not on, but doesn't help much when it is. Image sampler is Adaptive DMC with default settings. There are no reflective surfaces in this scene. 

There are two light sources affecting the figure: sphere and plane lights in a fireplace to the right, and a sphere light from a lamp on the floor to the left. Is it possible a mismatch in intensity on the lights is doing this? Could it be something in the material? (background is largely unaffected). 

The figure is skinned using basic textures, but FastSS2 produced the same effect. 


This problem has been a long-recurring thing in my renders and I haven't been able to figure out the source, any advice would be massively appreciated.

PTSD,"Situation Normal: All Fucked Up. 

Apparently in an effort to get drivers to zip-merge, DOT put signs for the lane closure way up by the 23rd Ave exit, and the end result was six million drivers piled up in the right lane for *miles*. Those few drivers who do shit like read the news pulled forward in the left lane, but they were an enormous minority and the upshot was that they had trouble merging back in, because 'fuck this guy'. 

The end result was that traffic was backed up to a standstill even further than it would have been ordinarily. They need to be a LOT more clear on the signage about what they expect drivers to do, in other words either put the merge signs further down, give express instructions via road LED signs, or ""Lane Closure Ahead, DON'T MERGE YET, YOU PROVINCIAL NITWITS"". Diagram that shit. We've been doing things one way for 20+ years, people need to be guided when you decide to do things differently.

PTSD,"But he's murdering me, I cannot bear it, or so I tell myself in these my weakest hours, in this my darkest moment, right now.

All my soul gathers up the ready-point where the ribcage meets the solar plexus, where the soul meets the body; in this stiff motel bed we war with one another, play out the mummery again, the ceremony of love and undertaking. He snatches my wrists in one strong hand, he hauls them over my head, shoves them against the softness of the pillow with a low masculine purr: I writhe and buck, this old game, and he presses me harder, hips pushing me into the bed, pinning me, his perfect hard weight. He knows me so well: he was my father figure, my first love, my secret undoing. I can never tell you, never anyone. This bliss is my religion.

My beloved collapses upon me: one hand shoves up under my shoulders and seizes my hair, he yanks my head to one side. This cruel tenderness, casual voracity, wise young man who loves with such impossible power, and readies himself now in an ecstasy of imminent satisfaction to further my sacrificial destruction. This is mutual. From him, I learned the word of Love.

""Are you ready,"" he whispers, against the thrilling skin of my throat. It's not a question, and he doesn't wait for an answer.

And the ritual begins, the dance commences. 

This pain is quick and hard, what mercy there is, familiar beloved and beautiful, blinding me for these few terrible seconds; he presses me down and in, bare hard skin on mine, demanding rod of his cock pressed like a dagger to my lower belly. 

His body contracts with pleasure; he growls deeply in my ear, chest vibrating on mine, and the pain intensifies, so that I twist my head and cry out loud, this high helpless cry he wants to hear. Oh, my love, never leave me; he releases my hands, snatches me around the midsection, and I throw my arms around his neck, bury my hands in the thick warm darkness of his hair. I pull him now, I grab him to me, throwing myself open for the devastation, my head straining back against the bed: oh, yes, never leave me, take it all, I don't care, I don't care. If someone has to kill me darling, only let it be you, let it be you, do it now, do it please.

And here is his shadow, the deadly darkness, cold empty void of desperate dark millennia, slicing me open like a knife, and I welcome it, warm little living girl who has so very much to give, who needs to lose this heat: so very much inside to pour out into this savage chasmic supernatural sorrow. Oh my unhappy love, so wise and sad, I give it to you, I don't care--! Take it, be my...

I don't want to live, I don't want to live, only to love --

He snarls quietly, yanks me up; his knee drives between my thighs, forcing me apart. I measure my breathing, like a woman in labor, bearing up under the pain; breathe, breathe, breathe, this pain is brief, and afterward, the high--the delirium that comes in a moment, that is worth the worst of the--

He drives in, high and hard, filling me up with a single fierce thrust; I am cast asunder, I am shoved apart and filled, filled even as I am draining down to nothing where the double penetration has already split me. His chest heaves; *my darling, my little one, who gives everything....*

I cannot do it this time beloved, my dark one, my only, my sweet cruel incubus, my father, my brother, my love, it's too deep --

His body contracts: no, this isn't pain. He fills me up with his love, as only he can: the gasp that escapes my lips is not pain. The golden tide seeps in at the edges of my vision: the pain is not, is not pain, anymore. The cold is not the cruel ice of death but...the warm mist of spring...the darkness that stretches now deep into the very aching atrium of my heart, it is not the agony of divestment, not the deathly weight of five hundred years, this is...the shadow of a leaf in September....this is the safe shadow in his shoulder, this is the black of his unhappy heart's wing, stretched up over me when the pain is....over. It extends into the deepest part of my soul: I reach up and embrace him, pull him closer, open myself up, stretch myself wide, pour myself out. Take what you need, aching beloved, I am....as always, so full....of life. Take it, take it, take it--

And now the second stage rockets fire.

There is no pain, not where his mouth is on me, not where his cock is buried in me like a blade, not where his heart is twining up tight with mine, python of sorrow, merciless power of desperation and oh this terrible tumbling to suicide, I have to hold him up, I--

No, it isn't pain now, he's taking me back up now, I feel this high again, sweet succulent gold snaking down through all the secret branches of my veins. He's coming in now: this is where we meet: this is the communion, this is why I keep coming back baby, this is the thing --

Oh, the vines of ancient nature, the gold of secret power, the high hot wine of life everlasting. Oh, my love, my love --

He is buried in me now, in every way. We surge together, the drumbeat of the devouring. He demands me and I go and there was never a question, I am in complete split perfection at this moment, and this is the man who loves me. 

He surges into me like the sea: I flow out into him like the tide. We approach the perfect moment together: there is no struggle between us. I will die for this, for him, and when he is alone again, let him come for you as well, let him never be alone, let him never feel this shadow, I will take it, I love you, I will be for this moment my terrible monster of a darling angel of the broken heart, I will be your vessel for now.

He forces forward to the hilt; my heart swells, past its limits, veins and arteries strain against the force of his ferocity: my body bends backward; I feel nothing but the gold, the sweetness of the shadow, the darling terror of death, the beautiful sweetness of sacrifice. He is in my womb, in my heart, in my soul, my bloodstream, my throat, my heart and aching solar plexus, my skin and my seizing breath and I am split to nothing, he pulls all that I am into him in a single convulsive gasp, I feel him bury himself, the giving over he can't help himself -- 

Oh, so terrible, gravity gone, full orbit, my beautiful one! -- 

-- and when the end comes I barely feel it, I am almost unconscious and then I am unconscious and I feel nothing and it's over again. I will wake in an hour and he will be gone, and all that remains is this terrible, terrible ache. I am almost divested: oh my ferocious high burning adolescent life, it is all in his eyes, in his lips and skin, in his dark beautiful hair. He is me now, for a little while, as I die here in the darkness, whispering secrets to strangers. You'd never forgive what you'll never believe. 

He taught me to love, and I love like no other, but soon enough this impossibly beautiful man will have drunk down the dregs of me. I am close now, I feel the cold all the time, the hard hollow ache in the solar plexus, the cool sweet emptiness where once my life burned so high. 

I love you all and still, because this impossible man loves like no other and he was my instructor in the dark art. Let him live till the sun burns out: let him never end, let his Alexandrian library never burn. I can't keep calm, I can't keep still; pulled apart against my will.

PTSD,"I was sitting on a folding chair, in a shabby little concrete basement hall: there seemed to be a class going on, although I don't remember seeing an instructor. I have the vague sense that there was something shameful about the class.

In front of the rows of metal folding chairs, there was a badly tattered white canvas sail, hung up as though to stand in for a blackboard. There were only a few people in attendance so far, or the class had only just begun, I'm not sure. 

A girl beside me, a rail-thin little thing with straggling black hair, dressed in torn black fishnet stockings and a 90's goth style dress, bumped into me by happenstance and leapt suddenly to her feet, startling the shit out of me and shoving back her chair on the concrete floor. I turned to her, and she laid into me with violent verbal accusation: I don't remember everything that was said, but I remember her shrieking *""FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!""* in a high furious voice. She scared and pissed me off, so I was returning this volley of verbal abuse, returning the sentiment furiously, we had it out for a few moments over nothing obvious, the way you might fight briefly with any asshole in a crowd. 

But after only a minute or two of this sudden outburst the girl's chest heaved, she paled, and she seemed to sort of crumple back to her chair: I realized suddenly that she wasn't well, wasn't well at *all* in fact, and might even be dying of some wasting sickness. She fell into her chair, and sort of ragdolled forward in exhaustion, so her head came to my shoulder: I had decided already to tolerate this: but she just kept falling, until I had to catch and hold her or she would have fallen to the floor. So I did, feeling absolutely different toward her. I remember trying to heal her with my hands, as if I could, and feeling a deep warm buzzing feeling passing between us that was somehow dark. I remember how terribly thin she was in my arms. I wasn't angry at all anymore and I understood absolutely that her anger was just exhaustion, that it wasn't personal. I held on to her as if it were my own child that had screamed at me, and felt a little awful for having been the cause of her exhaustion. Not completely, she was the one who went off the rails and I hadn't done anything to her, but I was sorry it had happened.

PTSD,"Sometimes you run across an artist here and there, in this song and that, this video or other, and it might take ages but eventually a picture starts to develop, fading backwards, the slow Polaroid of time and recognition and you see something that's always been inside of you, too, but you could never put a name to. 

I cannot express how not-insane Florence's music has made me feel, after almost 40 years of feeling other-how. In my worst, most manic, most ridiculous, cruelest and craziest moments, these things have sometimes left marks on my heart that I will probably never live down the shame of: these things have left me scrabbling in a very modern fashion after the mental illness that must explain what's wrong, what will excuse me. That's our modern absolution, The Diagnosis. I've had dozens and none of them proved solid, perfect or divine. All of them were human interpretations, you know? 

At the bottom this thing is more genie than genetic: it's more maenad than mental. I don't think there's anything Florence has done - the Odyssey in particular, *What Kind of Man*, *St. Jude*, *Ship to Wreck* - but also the work from *Ceremonials*, *Lungs*, *Bedroom Hymns*, *Cosmic Love* - I haven't met an artist I felt like this about since Tool released *Aenima*. 

I don't know what to say. In my own interpretation Florence is the feminine side of the powerfully masculine work of Tool - it's the same jewel from a different facet, the same water through a different faucet. She is honest to a fault, and I can't say how much I respect and adore that. It's reminiscent both of Tool, I think, and of early Tori Amos. Anger, longing, desperation, frustration, spiritual yearning and projection and co-dependence turning around and around on itself in what looks like a war but becomes much more like a dance. 

In the end of this too-short lovesong all I can say is that this is something I recognize, and this is the kind of recognition that does more good than The Diagnosis can. That is, in the end, the diagnosis. You recognize yourself at last, you know you aren't alone, and you know that it's fucking okay to be who you are and there's beauty in it, it's okay not to rein it in or rope it down even if it rips up the curtains or tears down the balcony. I fucking love her work, and I love her voice, and as far as I'm concerned this woman has a devotee for good. I've been a Tool/Perfect Circle/Puscifer devotee since *Sober*, and this is exactly the element that turned me on. 

I don't know who to tell. I know you know. I'm heartsick with recognition. It's like looking in a mirror and seeing someone else, seeing something other than twisted or broken, and finally you can accept what you see. Damn.

Have you ever attended a 'writer's workshop', or other class that purports to teach the art of writing, and found something curiously hollow about it? I've never trusted them, guys, workshops: I would think back to Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, Hemingway, Wilde, the great poets, and tried to picture them in a writer's workshop. Right? *Teaching* one maybe, and to no small value, but there always seemed something hollow in it.

PTSD,"This is probably half suited to /r/confession, but they'd think I'm crazy over there, heh. I have to make some introduction, so skip down if you dgaf and would like to hear about the dream.

I've had occasional dreams of what seems to be my [shadow-self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_%28psychology%29) since my teenaged years (I'm now 38).

 In the first dream, she clambered naked from a mirror in a public bathroom. She pads up to me, this chthonic thing white as a fish's belly with wet thick hair hanging in her face and water raining all around her, and when she lifted her head, less than a foot from me, and looked directly into my eyes, the face I saw was my own. The rage in her face was sickening, terrifying, not me at all. It was myself, but warped and ruined by fury so terrible that it eclipsed and made obsolete the fucking concept of a soul. Terrible Kali with nothing to spare for all the world but overpowering absolute insane anger, some kind of goddess of the razor, I can't overstate how bad it was. 

In the dream it filled me with awful horror. I struggled with it for a very long time, exposed to this thing that I knew was true somehow but had no idea how to assimilate or cope with. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it was important; privately I thought of it as 'my sister', something important that had announced itself and insisted on itself. I was afraid that if I didn't acknowledge it and make peace with it that it would make a murderer out of me. It put an identity on a lot of bad shit inside. It was fucking scary, for a long time, and my messing and negotiating with it would eventually lead to a bout of psychosis in my twenties. Jung was right, that's some heavy shit and not to be trifled with.

In the first dream she was naked; in subsequent dreams she would appear wearing a long black coat, after I acknowledged that I was seeing some kind of amputated part of me (and eventually, my shadow self). In some of the worst parts of my life she would appear in a nurse's uniform, strangely enough, giving me harsh injections and telling me to quit my bitching. It's a long story, but:

----

**In the dream I had a couple nights ago:** 

I was walking through a fairground with a couple of friends and coworkers. Everything seemed fairly positive for most of the dream, but toward the end things took a dark turn; I came around a corner and saw someone crumpled against a little corner in a freestanding wall, a man wearing blue shorts and a striped shirt. He was extremely dead and bloated: think a week-old corpse in the hot sun. 

I don't like dead people. I was immediately unnerved and didn't move toward him, maybe sensing in the back of my mind that this was a dream and he might well get up. There was a bicycle lying askew near the body, as if he had just ridden the bike into the wall and fallen down dead.

This bugged me. I moved on, feeling mighty off now, and a few feet away beside a similar wall came upon a second body.

It was white, I mean dead white. Female. Long dark hair, and bloated like the man, white, tongue pushed out of her mouth by decay; very dead. I stood still in recognition, terrible tunnel-vision of fear, because that body was me. That was my own dead, swollen, fucked-up corpse.

I fell back, turned away, didn't want to look. I hurried away, don't look, and for some reason like Lot's wife I just had to look again. 

And now it was my sister, my shadow-self. Now there was a long black coat on the corpse; she was in a different position, propped with her head on the wall, and as I stared with this spiraling horror she lifted her head toward me. The eyes were empty: the left slightly closed, the right a hollow hole. The mouth hung agape, a mummy's mouth. She was white as snow, not bloated, but withered. And she was looking at me. She saw me, with her empty sockets and that terrible knowing intelligence that's always been the hallmark of that entity. Her teeth were bared in a death's-head grimace. Very dead, but very not.

I turned away for good. I fled the place, and my next memory which seems stupid comparatively was standing in a grocery line, seconds before my alarm went off. My coworkers were all barking my name, calling me; I turned to them irritably, held up my purchase and yelled ""I HAVE TO BUY A TOOTHBRUSH! YOU REALIZE I'M TRYING TO MOVE, RIGHT?"" (As in 'move away'.)

-----
**And this is the epiphany:** 

I woke up totally puzzled and disturbed, wondering why my anger appeared like that. What was it telling me? 

Long story short for ten years I was in a nasty, abusive, terrible relationship. It fucked me up mighty bad and I really hated him in aftermath, because I thought he had spitefully wrecked my spirit, ruined me, goaded me and destroyed my love of life. He wasn't physically abusive, but he had a very cruel mouth, alternating with ridiculous devotion, and soon I was haunted by my own cruel temper in response, my own increasing hate of him in the face of his occasional semblance of love. Couldn't assimilate how I behaved in response. Gave him a lot of power in my mind, for having trashed so much of me. It was a mystery and it fucked me up for a long time.

The dream was telling me that my furious shadow-self had become like a corpse. 

Jung teaches that the Shadow holds a lot of personal power, understandable in the case of anger; all of the power tied into my anger, or in other words my passion, had become like a corpse. Deep down I know that was true. I've been fighting so hard with that, my inability to get angry or even defend myself, to be creative and let go, my fear of getting angry because he 'loved' me and my anger had done such 'damage', I chain my sister in a box seven fathoms under the sea.

But why? Why is she a corpse? Had he done that? He couldn't do that.

*Because*, came this thought as I was sitting on the deck trying to puzzle it. *Because your love was set in opposition to your anger*. 

He didn't tear me apart. I did. I loved him and hated him, more than once, literally wanted to kill or severely hurt him for the things he'd say. For the trespass on me, for the insult to love. But I loved him, because he thought he loved me. 

And that was it, /r/dreams, he didn't tear me apart, I did. I had killed my sister and chained her seven fathoms down because my anger and my love were set in opposition by that experience. To live again, to recover and be healthy and free again, I had to disentangle that battle and admit that he had nothing to do with it. He didn't kill me. I did. I was the one who choked myself to death. The power was always my own, and not his. It had all been an illusion.

All this sounds horrible, but I tell you I haven't felt this well in ages now. 

It sometimes does good to puzzle out even the nastiest nightmares, guys. Dreams have a lot to teach. They show things in the ugliest damn way sometimes but sometimes the answers just follow on; life is so strange.

How old was I, sixteen maybe? 

Fuck you, I miss you so much I could fucking die, I miss you. I haven't seen you since August: I haven't heard from you since April. You told me it was going to work out, that we would have our chance now...that everything would be okay now.

PTSD,"It was for my son's 17th birthday: he's been cobbling along with an elderly Dell for ten years, it needed to be replaced and I wanted to bring him with me to have him pick one out, so I foolishly didn't buy it online. Who would have thought you'd have a better chance of getting what you expect online than you do from a brick-and-mortar? 

I set a limit of $400, since we already had a lot of hardware at home that could easily soup a mid-grade to a nice PC. I'd seen a Pavilion 550-~~1a4~~ a14 online and it seemed just the thing, we found one at the local Best Buy for $455 that turned into $485 after tax, but hey, my son never asks for anything and hasn't had a really nice present in ages, if that's what he wants I'm getting it. 

We get it home, I open it and I am damn *boggled*. I never expected this. It's like buying a car and realizing it has no catalytic converter. What the fuck am I looking at? 

This $500 PC has two memory slots and NO CARD SLOTS. None. No PCI, no AGP, no PCI-E, no fucking goddamn anything. Mind you this wasn't a compact case, this was a full case that should easily hold new hardware. Yes, I should have pulled the floor model out and looked at the back, I realize that now, but the model online had very evident slots for expansion. 

I spent $200 on a new computer several years ago and it had four memory slots, two PCI slots and a PCI-E slot, and I made a pretty good bundle of Pentiums out of it in the end. I can't do anything with this one. You can't upgrade it, you can't modify it, the mobo was the size of a piece of paper and just about as useful. 

After going through three hours of nonsense scraping Windows 8 out of it and installing Windows 7 - UEFI, pain in the ass that it is - we turn it on, I clean it up and use The Method on it to get it running at its best (stop stupid services, turn off Aero, get all drivers in and updated, etc), we find that the god damn thing runs like shit. I mean of course it does, when you're stuck with fucking onboard graphics and can't even play Minecraft on it without lagging half to hell. For $500! 

I can't tell you how fucking annoyed I am about this. My son is disappointed, although he's the world's most patient kid and he tries not to show it, and I'm out all that money I barely had, at least for now. I'm utterly disgusted that they scraped that crap off on us as a useable computer, I'm guessing you have to buy a 'gaming computer' now if you want anything so basic as an open card slot. What the holy rolling hell is this? 

So I'm returning it, as soon as I get my car to a mechanic and find out why the engine light's been on for three days, because I live 20 miles out of town and this took priority because my son hasn't had a present worth a damn for his birthday in forever. I'm so mad, you guys. Fucking Best Buy, are you kidding me? Really? Fuck.

PTSD,"You know how a dream can leave a particular 'taste' in your mouth, a vibe about your thoughts, that sticks around all day, and in the case of a bad dream, troubles you? I've been off my game all day:  I fear something crooked is going on down in the psychic boiler room. Even the wake-up today was bad juju. 

I dreamt of being in a narrow, many-walled place, full of corridors and shadows, with three other people: a faceless friend of mine, a black man who looked like (but wasn't) Denzel Washington, and a blond woman whom he loved or was married to. 

We were the last survivors, because throughout the previous two days or so, whatever group or tribe was with us had been killed off one by one by a faceless, formless spirit who ripped them to pieces as soon as they fell asleep. 

To watch someone die like this - I had seen the others die - was like watching a time-lapse video of decomposition, but instead of normal decay there was a brutal, furious tearing and ripping of the body, total disregard for joints and bones, the body blown up at the middle from the bed, jostled and split by the force of disintegration like something hit by a slow-motion cannonball. The body came apart at the mercy of an evil spirit that relished destroying it. (I hate gore in films, at 38 I still peer through my fingers at it, I'm not exposed to it much and not desensitized, but have used the internet enough to have a pretty good grip on the details.)

It was implied that the doomed sleeper was also experiencing a profound nightmare; there was a spirit with a distinct personality that was responsible for all this. It was male, and it spoke to us - but faceless, formless, it was disembodied cheerful cruelty, very intelligent and somehow hard to outwit. We entertained it, it enjoyed its power in destroying us. It had pared us down to a few stragglers and amiably bided its time, because inevitably we would fall asleep, if only to die of exhaustion, and then it would tear us to pieces in every possible way. The spirit was having a good time with this.

We had worked out some last desperate plan, but disaster struck: the black man finally couldn't keep going and fell asleep. I was banging on a glass pane or wall between us and crying his name, trying to wake him or stop the spirit, but the spirit was gathering itself to destroy him and all I could do was watch it happen.

Scene shift: 

I'm standing at the edge of a crosswalk at night, in a very busy intersection. 

The light has just changed to DON'T WALK. In the middle of the intersection, a very old little man and his frail wife have become stranded: they flounder there as the traffic advances on them, horns blowing. The old man somehow becomes tangled in a portion of the crosswalk paint that's peeled up from the road.

*(As bad as the first part was, this was the worst! This was the worst!)*

I ran to the middle of the intersection to help them: the old man was almost sobbing with confusion and fear, stranded in the crosswalk. His wife clung to him for security, terrified. They were so old, like tiny birds. 

I took the man's little arm, and then reached out and took the arm of the wife, and her tiny, stemlike arm came right off in my hand.

I looked down. It was thin as a reed, a swarthy color, and it beat in my fingers just like a vein, throbbing hard against my fingers, like the veins you find in chicken sometimes, but alive and throbbing wildly. It was the most spine-crawling sensation but I'm hardly going to throw a little old lady's severed arm down in the crosswalk. I put my hand between the old man's shoulderblades, his one-armed wife clinging to his arm, and with this tiny arm beating in my hand I led them to safety on the far side of the crosswalk.

I managed to flag down a cab, and put them in and got in with them, paid the driver and asked him to take us quickly to the hospital. 

So he takes us less than a block, and let us out in front of the gaudiest, seediest liquor store you can imagine. Piss-yellow neon and gaudy beer boxes in stacks, worn-out people wandering between the rows, and the old couple and I go in for some unthinkable reason; I'm standing there at a loss in the liquor store, sure this isn't right but completely befuddled for some reason. The old man is turning in circles and confusion there in the middle of the floor. The old lady's arm is gone, forgotten in the cab, I don't know, am I still holding it? She clings to him, lost. And I wake up.

I looked at my clock: 5:44, one minute to the alarm. I turned it off, and as I got up I realized I had a bad and deep pain in my left forefinger, as if it had been cut and become badly infected. I looked at it: there's a small cut on the knuckle, and it's swollen, but not red or inflamed. 

As I sat up, a sudden sharp pain on the left side of my chest stopped me cold. It was deep and awful: I grabbed my chest and took in a breath, but it didn't recur. When I moved to get up it hit me again, hard and bad, and then was gone again.

Carefully I got up, examining my finger. There are creases on it, as if I'd slept on it, maybe that was it. I got to my feet and headed for the shower; the chest pain didn't come back. The pain in my finger would be completely gone by the time I left for work an hour later.

And that's all: I don't know that there's even anything to interpret in it, but damn that one is bothering me. The sensation of that vein pounding in that tiny old lady's severed arm was just chilling. I don't like it when nightmares like this happen, it makes me suspicious that there's a leak in my Titanic.

PTSD,"It's only now that I've noticed I'm still turning last night's dream over in my head; I keep having these dreams about Boston, and I don't know why but I'm almost wild to know. I'm half tempted to take a holiday to visit that town, the feeling about it is that strong, although I know no one there and have never even particularly thought about the place in any special way, ever. 

The first dream happened some years ago: it wasn't extraordinary, in it I was driving a car down a small hill toward a very broad four-way intersection. The road was blacktop, and there were four stark white crosswalks on it. 

On my right as I reach the intersection, there is a squat building with large glass windows. It's a shop, or karate class, or childcare, a business. There is another nondescript building on the other side of it, and then an alleyway. On the other side of the alley is a three- or four-story building of red brick. it's very square and plain, like a flat, and on the top floor is a window facing the alley with small curtains. Someone lives there. It's important for some reason. The buildings are all red brick, and I know it's Boston.

Last night I had another dream of it: I was in a residential area this time, I think. The road was very curvy, very narrow as in a private community, and again there were buildings on either side with distinctive red brick facades, they looked like apartment buildings but they might have been large homes. There were many flowers, a fine little place, if it was a neighborhood it was a well-off one. 

Not far away, there was a narrow street with white two-story buildings that looked like Bourbon Street (somewhere else I've never been). I remember commenting in the dream with uncharacteristic sarcasm that ""It's just like New Orleans, but look, no guns, no drugs, no murders, nothing seedy about this place at all. It just isn't the same.""

I guess I'm just recording this for posterity, I don't even know what questions to ask you guys about it, I'm so confused about these dreams and something in me is insisting there's something important about them.

PTSD,"Man, it's not that I don't get it. I read the posts by the [TRPers](http://www.reddit.com/r/theredpill) and the [MRAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/) and the [PUAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction), the terms they use, the dehumanizing way they portray us, the ugly things they think and I get so angry sometimes, so indignant, furious even, but it's not that I don't get it.

I was almost the female version of an MRA for most of my life. All my friends were men and I watched them get their hearts broken over and over again, and a man - it seems to me - feels grief over a broken relationship or a betrayal more acutely than any woman I have ever known, more acutely than I ever have. Don't you get me wrong, I have felt that pain exquisitely, but I still don't think I have ever known it the way a man does.

I respect that; I am humbled by that. I have enormous respect for a man's capacity to love with his entire heart, and somehow a great awe of his capacity to hate with that same force. I have a lot to learn from that and I willingly admit it. They say that we are the emotional sex, but privately? No, I can only wish for that.

I think that sometimes the thing standing between a lot of these guys and an awareness of the strength, wisdom and power in them - yes, I mean that, in their furious abandon to that great holy fire of entire love - is a kind of shame, a kind of guilt, a kind of love that just holds on to the heart and keeps chewing in memoriam of betrayal, biting through the tough tendons of strength to the blood of the tender pulp inside. I cannot tell you how much it saddens me to think of a man's holy heart blackened by the abscess of infection, the infection of hate that is really an intensity of emotion that used to know itself as love.

It's not that I don't get it. These men - the PUAs and the TRPers in particular - I wish they knew that in pretending to be something they're not, in cauterizing the conduits of their immensely powerful hearts, they are giving up their most fundamental strength, the wellspring of their kingship. They turn a great strength into a cruel and clumsy weapon, and they make an enemy out of all women, for the memory of one woman, or the first woman. They hate us, lock us all out, deny themselves forever the reflection of perfection in an acolyte's gaze. It bothers me, interests me, I still respect it. I come by the username honestly, okay.

I respect the force of emotion that clings and claws and tears, the way a wounded animal will bite off the next hand that reaches to it. I have no condemnation of that because I am in awe of a man's power of emotion and I want to learn from it, to inure it into myself and become a student of it. 

But I can't explain what a difficulty it is to think they will take out vengeance on some past betrayal as a Trojan horse breaching my own fortified walls. Reading those subreddits frightens me. I don't know how to explain it, I could certainly never walk away from the empyrean male personality, but to think they'd make war on me for the sin of the star I was born under, for the sake of my gender alone - frankly that pisses me off, and I can't help that. 

We're not all out to get you, goddamnit. If you could only see yourself clearly, you wouldn't be ashamed of the force of your own emotions. They're your fucking strength, not your weakness. I'm just a Delphic oracle against the holiness of a fire like that.

I work at Denny's as a waitress, not the most glamorous job, but it's a paycheck and a damn good one with a little hustle. 

I was feeling a little tired that morning, but better - my dentist visit the previous week had revealed the atrocious tooth abscess that had been the real source of my depression and fatigue, and after a few days on antibiotics I was starting to feel a lot better again. I was preparing for the day as usual, sucking down my third cigarette, when the man came ambling up the sidewalk behind me, muttering angrily under his breath. 

He was an older man, wearing an inside-out gray sweatshirt, with his hair standing up in wild little frays and two days' worth of beard on his chin. As he approached me, I heard him call, 'hey, do you have a cigarette?'. 

Willingly enough I took out my case and handed him a square; he took the opportunity to pause and talk to me, and at first he was angry about something that had happened in the restaurant: it was a rambling story and hard to make sense of, but it seemed that he had been having a nice chat with someone else who had cursed aloud 'in front of a lady', apparently the waitress. That had upset him for some reason he seemed to find it hard to put his finger on; he had become so upset that he must have made a minor scene, because he recounted to me miserably that some woman had come up to him and asked him if he needed to go to a hospital. He seemed upset by her gesture, partly because of its plain and simple insult - hell, I'd be annoyed, wouldn't you? - and partly because he knew he damn well did but had already been on that merry-go-round. Have you? Have you been poor, in need of help, be it mental or medical, and established just how much help the poor get? Yeah, me too man.

""I never knew my mother,"" he said to me; ""I never knew my father. I don't have anywhere to go."" 

And see, that's how a person gets to the level he was at. Think on your family, on the support and safety net they offer - if the bottom drops out, there is someone there to *notice*, to help you get your shit back together, to give you somewhere to go.

This man had to be what, sixty, seventy? Maybe an injured fifty? He'd probably been on the streets a long time; even if he did have parents, think of the stories you've heard even on reddit, of parents that renounce their imperfect children. By now in that man's life those parents were passed on, probably, if not certainly, tiny figures in life's rearview, so far away they might have never been.

Christ, guys, I don't know how long I stood there with him, listening to his pain. He told me of having nowhere to go, not in the way someone begs for help - just in the way that someone with no one to talk to just desperately needs someone to talk to. I was obviously in no position to help him and he saw that, didn't beg or ask for shit, he just wanted someone to understand, to listen, at least. 

And I did. I stood there with the abscess lurking in my jaw and remembered the cheerful way the well-fed BMW-driving dentist had told me it would be almost $5k to remove my killing teeth and fix my tired, early-aged face; 'no, we don't accept payment plans, everything due up front' and the way he only gave me penicillin that's BARELY holding the fucking infection off, the way he didn't offer painkillers and I didn't ask although it's like there's a wasp in my mouth all the time. I'm poor, so I'm clearly an untrustworthy junkie, right? Yeah, those blind fuckers, I knew it'd be all my savings and assets to pull this off. 

The worry became small, even fucking entitled, here before this guy with clear problems no one would listen to, no family to fall back on, too hurt even to wait tables at Denny's, the hole all of us fear to fall into, weaklings we are, you know. Admit it, there's something humbling about the true suffering of other people. That's some fucking suffering, to be sixty (a tired fifty?), out on the street in an inside-out sweatshirt with the whole world fucking you over and nowhere to sleep, no sympathetic ear to care. I know just a couple different happenstance steps in life's tango would have me in the same place. 

So I listened; I nodded and commiserated; I confessed the evil abscess, the sixteen-year-old boy at home I was trying to feed, the choice I had to make, the dicks people are to you when you're not goddamn made of money. We talked for twenty minutes or so, he doing most of it, I offered my end only to evidence to him that I understood from poverty's perspective how fucking impossible it can be to be simply alive, simply human, and how fucked up that was that a man like him can't get the simple human help to live, that the world is so cruel these days to the poor and the desperate. 

And the oddest thing, guys.

I was watching him as he spoke, and noticed suddenly that his eyes were a bright green, clear and direct: that if his hair were nicely cut, and the stubble cleaned up, he would be *indistinguishable* from a college professor, a learned scholar, a saint. 

It was a little stunning to me, I was looking on a man like your own damn grandfather, even a handsome man who was so hurt that he couldn't function. I couldn't stop seeing him that way from that point on and didn't want to. A suffering human, in a fucked-up material world with no pity or mercy but you have the dollar bills to buy it. Oh, what a mess we're in. Oh dear. He could have been a philosopher, the man had a mind, but a mind so injured by the simple process of trying to get on without playing this ugly societal game we've devised - 

Eh, a moment of stunned pain, unable to offer a word, I suddenly told him he wasn't alone, and carefully embraced him. How he stiffened! How shocked he was! 

Oh, I had to go. I had to be on at eight and if I wasn't on the floor I'd catch hell. 

""It will be all right in the end,"" I said to him. ""It will be all right."" 

And I believed that, I do, it gets me from hour to hour, from Monday to Sunday, best I could do.

""I'll remember what you said,"" he said as we parted. ""I'll remember that embrace."" 

I got in. 

I confessed to my coworkers what had detained me.

They laughed. Har, har, har. That guy. Har. Har. You're. Hilarious.





 ",Sysiphuslove
PTSD,"I'm writing this in the little sliver of time between getting up and leaving for work, sorry for my brevity. This was a pretty cool dream.

There was a section of the dream where I was fleeing somewhere with two other people. As we were running - it was an empty road that looked to be in a desert somewhere - I heard an enormous rumbling in the sky, as if a storm might be coming, and turning my head I saw a gigantic funnel cloud hanging over a mesa probably eight miles to the south of us. 

I pointed, warning the others, and we paused for a moment to look; as we watched the slowly rotating bulge in the cloud, a second funnel snaked down from it toward the mesa. I have dreamed of the whirlwind before, several times, I'm still not sure what exactly it represents but it always has a kind of sentience about it, as if it were a presence rather than a symbol. 

As we stood watching this second funnel, the bulge came down into a thick pillar of a tornado, and the two funnels together joined at the plateau of the mesa. There was a world-ending explosion; we fell back and took shelter, either behind a rock or in a convenient room, I don't remember. It was an explosion to end a world, like standing too close to a science-fiction special effect in real life. A lot of wind, of blinding light, I think the light might have had a form for a moment but again I'm not sure: I was too busy trying not to be killed.

Almost as soon as I took shelter the eruption was over, and the people I was with gasped and called me out of the shelter to look. 

When I came out, I saw a scene there before me where (I think) the mesa had been. It was swathed in a warm, grainy white light, like light seen through a white flannel blanket: a triangular scene; something like a Greek palace at the apex, the temple of Athens. There on top was a man who had to be Jesus Christ; he stood with his hands to his sides, and somewhere above or behind him was the symbol of a cross. He wore a white robe and a red sort of overgarment, not the toga-sort you see in some pictures but rather like an open robe atop the first. There were other beings close to the top of the triangular scene, very alight, maybe angels: at the lowest point were figures clothed more colorfully, that might have been representative of saints or other holy-but-corporeal beings. There were gold things there, something gold, although I saw the scene for only a moment and remember it only as a kind of iconic image. 

The next I remember, it was being explained to me by some wiser being that what I had seen was due to a very rare set of deposits of 'titanium dioxide' in the earth where the tornados had struck. Somehow there was more than one of these deposits, and the violence of the impact had been a catalyst that caused a massive volatile reaction in these titanium deposits. It was pointed out to me, or I might have seen in the dream, that these deposits were a green crystalline substance; I was told that they don't often occur 'twice on the same planet'. A great deal of the end of the dream was devoted to discussing these deposits of titanium dioxide, but I was interrupted by my alarm and don't remember that part well.

My front teeth are mostly all right, but bruxism has broken and worn almost all the back ones, and my whole life was taken over by maintenance of the mess and coping with the consequences. Infection robbed me of my mental health, of my energy and my love of life; pain has been my constant companion for years; I haven't been able to eat very well, the missing teeth have made my face look thin and too old, my heart was getting fucked up by the pain and the infections, there is no area of my life that hasn't been impacted by my mouth. One back cavity in particular has been like living with a newborn for years: it ruins my sleep, I have to go through an extensive daily ritual to keep it from getting infected, I have to eat carefully and drink sparingly, I've carried it like an anvil through every day. 

I'm finally getting it fixed, I'm getting it all fixed. It's going to be hell getting it all straightened out but I'm taking my life back from the miserable end I'd resigned myself to. I don't have to die for this. My head was so messed up by it, I didn't have the money and I'd just given up.

PTSD,"This is a short vignette, part of a larger dream, but defined, emotionally intense and hard to forget. 

I dreamt of standing several yards away from a small, circular fenced area, in which there was wandering a huge dark bear. It had been fitted with a worn metal harness of some kind that went under its chest and around its shaggy neck, and was roaring and pacing back and forth in an agitated way. 

Something distracted my attention for a moment, and when I looked back a little blond girl in pigtails wearing a pink jumper had come out of nowhere on one of those oversize plastic trikes, and as I watched she climbed just inside the fence and in reach of the bear. 

""Oh my God,"" I gasped, and took off running for the fenced area: the bear charged across the enclosure and got hold of her in its paws before I could reach them. As I was climbing over the fence I noticed two older men in overalls standing nearby, one of them beginning to straighten up from where he'd been leaning on a wall as he realized what was going on.

""Help me,"" I wheezed, even as I climbed into the enclosure with the growling, whuffing bear, and my voice would only come out as a hoarse whisper. ""Someone help me,"" but there was no time, they couldn't hear or understand me. 

The little girl was caught in the bear's embrace; she was unhurt, and seemed to be unconscious. I reached out and took hold of her under the torso and by one arm; the bear's muzzle was right in front of my face, it huffed and looked at me with its cloudy brown eyes. I was afraid to pull her lest the animal decide we were fighting over dinner and tear one or both of us up: for a long moment I just held still, holding her by the body with one hand wrapped firmly around her soft, pale little forearm, and waited for the bear to let go.

It did, after a moment, and I lifted the baby free and jumped out of the enclosure. I remember nothing more of that scene after this, so I think it jumped immediately to another setting at that point. 

Thanks for reading guys, I just felt the need to write this one down.",Sysiphuslove
PTSD,"This was a very strange dream, disjointed and erratic, hard to describe and hard to remember, but it's proving hard to forget; I'll do the best I can, I feel like I need to talk about this.

I don't think I began this dream as a vampire: I have a vague memory of something passing through me, or near me, and when it touched me it seemed as though I lost something, something came out of me or was taken. I've had dreams before of losing my soul, and it created the same feeling; I was overcome with a kind of emptiness, a desperation that felt more like heartache or homesickness than physical hunger. I don't remember if I changed physically, but I felt physically different, hunched and warped, bent more by the incredible void inside me than by my bones. 

The thing I remember most clearly was wandering around with a deep, fundamental feeling of hunger, a yearning, not just for blood but for something more spiritual than that; I needed something, and I wandered around in search of it, not knowing what it was, but unable to stop even for a moment, being empty hurt so much. 

I remember coming upon a little bit of blood in a white ceramic dish, no bigger than a baby's fist. The blood was very dark, rimmed red in the white dish; I think someone was there at the time, they may have given me the blood or it might have been removed from them; I remember being ashamed of myself as I took it up, but not why. I drank the blood from the bowl, tasting nothing, and feeling no better; it was 'what I needed', but not what I was missing. It kept me going, only to continue searching. It was like being a ghost, a trapped spirit. 

There was a moment later in the dream where I encountered another vampire; he was male, but it's hard to remember his face. We were companions for a little while in the dream, more out of the kinship of the desperate than from real friendship; something happened to him at the end, some fire opened up to consume him, and he threw himself into it - I was sad at this, it was a kind of suicide - but as he fell into the fire he screamed, a high drawn-out howl that became a word: ""LIIIIGHT!""

I don't remember much after this, I know there wasn't a lot of form to the description; that's how the dream was, like something seen through the eyes of a ghost that's half-lost its mind, no longer really seeing, just feeling what's inside more than attending the world around. It was very uncomfortable and strange, I'm not quite sure what to make of it. ",Sysiphuslove

",Sysiphuslove
PTSD,"This happened in a split second during an otherwise unremarkable dream. 

I was pulling out of a parking lot, and found myself tucked into a corner near the curb in such a way that I had to do a three-point turn to get out. I did that, put on my turn signal and pulled up to a little driveway onto the road. 

A guy in a large SUV was just coming around the corner; he had his own turn signal on. He didn't seem to be anywhere near me, so I started to go on and pull out into the road; there was immediately a terrific crash, huge bang as the car jolted away under me and went over on its side, and the guy went flying past me, hit a pole and spun, then tore on across the lot hitting two more cars and a bus on the way. I couldn't see most of the carnage, but when I looked across the lot I saw that the bus had a huge hole torn in the back of it. 

I got out and surveyed the damage: my car looked perfectly fine, other than being tipped over on its side. The guy who had hit me had rolled; his car was smashed, and every car involved in that wreck including mine had been flipped onto its side. I remember noting with curiosity that the tires of all the cars, mine included, were smooth metal with no tread: 'well, no wonder', I thought, but didn't pay it much mind. 

The part of the dream that's bothering me most happened a few minutes later, as a mechanic was studying the damage to my car (which was fairly minimal, although the bottom had come off and looked curiously like a bedframe, and the axles had come loose on sliders and were compacted to the middle of the car). 

""Well, you better be ready for this darlin,"" he said, wiping his hands on a cloth and looking clinically down at my busted car. ""They're going to make you fight over this one."" 

I burst into tears. ""I don't want to fight,"" I said, suddenly despairing and exhausted. ""I'm so fucking tired of fighting."" 

He just shook his head, looking at the car, and seemed not to take much notice of my outburst. 

I'm not sure what that meant but I woke up with the same dismayed feeling and an uncomfortable conviction that it meant something more than it seemed to, something important. I'm not sure.",Sysiphuslove

PTSD,"This happened yesterday afternoon, around 4pm. 

I was just finishing up my shift, and this dude came in in shorts and a green jacket (in January). He went over and sat down and another waitress took him, there was nothing unusual about his visit at first except that he kept talking to the guy in front of him at another table, whom I'm pretty sure didn't know him. I wasn't paying a lot of attention at the time, I was busy with my side work. 

About fifteen minutes into his visit, I walked over to wipe off the table behind him when another customer called me over, visibly upset; he pointed at Green Jacket with a trembling finger and said ""Miss, I suggest you call the police and have this gentleman evicted."" Green Jacket just looked at me, didn't seem upset, so I assumed there had been an altercation between them; the angry customer said ""He tried to take his crackers and he blew up at him!"" I didn't have any clue who was who in that story, but I offered to move the upset guy and he was more than willing. I moved him to another section and he seemed to be fine with that.

All was well for a little while, then talk filtered through the servers that he was threatening other customers, that he had threatened his waitress. My manager came out, (unwisely) said ""if he says anything else come get me, I'll bring Mike (the burly cook) out with me and we'll take care of it."" 

She went back into the back, but Green Jacket seemed to see this interaction and he came up to the front; I was standing there at the time, he said ""I just want to pay for my soup and drink and I'm leaving."" 

Okay. I flagged down his server, she went off to split the bill so he could pay, and I turned to him and said ""Okay sir, she's getting it worked out and we'll get it straightened out for you."" 

He looks me dead in the eye and calmly says ""Don't be sarcastic with me. I was in the Marines. I'll kick the shit out of you."" 

Now see this guy didn't know me. He doesn't know me from Eve. He doesn't know that I have a terrific temper, that physical threats are nothing new to me, or that I will fight like a rabid cat on a coke binge if someone threatens me. I saw that he was serious, and I went into The Mode immediately, something I have never done before at work or in public. 

People say terrible things to me all the time, it goes past me like a spring breeze, but this guy put me on instant fight mode; I knew he was serious. I was immediately not at all scared of him, instead it was as if a cold unfeeling sheath dropped over my consciousness and it was just me and him. I met his eyes squarely, only dimly aware that my four-foot-two co-worker was right behind me at the other computer and this guy was off his gourd. He was serious and I knew it. 

With my eyes on his, without saying another word, I moved over so I was between him and my co-worker and leaned on the counter with my arms folded in front of me, the way you'd keep an eye on an unruly prisoner. Coldly I noted another customer behind him that he hadn't seen yet; a man. The man was giving him a look that told me he was aware of the situation. There was a pair of scissors lying next to the register.

Green Jacket's hands were in his pockets, and our eyes were locked. I didn't know if he was armed but every muscle in my body was ready to go Mary Lou Retton over that counter if he so much as moved funny. I wasn't afraid at all. Not yet.

My coworker came back and stood at the register, just in front of him, and I put a hand to her back, murmured I was here and stood right next to her, watching Green Jacket carefully. If he moved too quickly I was going to react. I had chosen the angle and direction I'd go at him, where his arm would be, what I'd do if he brought his arm out in a certain way that indicated a weapon. I would push her back and then I would go for him. I had an ally in the man behind him. I was *hyped*. 

The transaction went by. I watched him motionlessly. He paid, and only when he turned around and went out the door did the aftereffect hit me. NOW I was scared. Now I realized how bad that could have been and how much it had really tripped me out. It was not a pleasant feeling, I have not felt that cold calculating unfeeling readiness to get hurt in a long time. 

I was wired as fuck for the next two hours. His waitress said that he had threatened to come back with a weapon, and I ended up sitting in my running car for fifteen minutes because I thought I saw him through the glass doors of the motel across the parking lot. 

That was very unnerving. I still don't know if I overreacted or not. Either way I was really hoping I had reached a point in my life where that coldness was behind me. Freaky stuff, guys.

**UPDATE**: As it turned out I DID see him through the doors of the motel: as soon as he left our building he went straight over there, got into a confrontation with the front desk and was arrested by the police that they wisely called almost right away. As far as I know he's still in a cell a week later, but either way I don't think we'll be seeing that loony little shit again. ",Sysiphuslove
PTSD,"PTSD is correlated with sudden, egregious violence that rips apart a personal notion of safety and disrupts a person's functioning and sense of security. Diagnostic criteria include: 

* Hypervigilance
* Flashbacks or 'reliving' the traumatic event
* Significant distress and impairment of daily life 
* Exaggerated startle response 
* Sudden outbursts of anger

The ongoing response is in a way more harmful than the original trauma. ",Sysiphuslove

There was one room with a male Egyptian god inside, and I remember standing on the left side of the temple and not looking inside, because I was afraid of that god: I associated him with mummies and death, although he was not malevolent. I didn't see that god, but had the impression of a door being opened there and of pilgrims going in to pay respects to him.

----
So a four-top came in last Friday morning, a grandpa, a grandma and two young kids; it wasn't my table, but I went ahead and did their drinks as my roomie was working the register. Grandpa has a tall glass of milk, coffee for Grandma, juice for the kiddies; a pretty standard transaction, and once I'd delivered their drinks I assured them my coworker would be right with them, and went into the back to make some biscuits and get creamer. 

At the time I had three tables in the room: a two-top in a booth next to that four-top, another two at a table nearby and one more deuce across the room. It was a light morning, and I took my time with the biscuits as everyone was eating merrily and things were going well.

As I was loading the oven, I heard a brief commotion out front, which I didn't pay a lot of attention to: I had to go into the back to get the creamer, so I didn't see my coworker come hauling ass into the dishroom, and I didn't see the dishwasher trundle out into the front room with a mop bucket.

As I emerged back into the dining room with the creamer, I glanced around at my tables, and paused at the pale, stunned stare of the lady at my table two-top. I set the cream down and went straight over, and she watched me approach with a look in her eye like an infantryman who's seen the shit go down in Nam. 

""Is everything okay?"", I said, scanning the table: the food looked fine and half-eaten, the drinks were okay, jelly stocked, sugar good. The woman met my eyes in horror: ""No,"" she said, ""No, everything is not okay."" 

Totally puzzled, I leaned closer and said ""What's wrong?"" 

She lifted a finger and pointed behind me: I turned, and the four-top booth was empty: Grandparents and the kids had moved a seat over to another table. The dishwasher was standing there, grouchily mopping under the table: it looked like there'd been a spill.

I looked back to my customer, confused: she finally seemed to realize I had missed the action, so in a stage whisper she said ""That guy just threw up all over himself. All over the booth. All over the place."" 

I looked back, and that was when the smell hit me. Grandpa. That was distinctly the smell of milk vomit. 

Horrified I apologized to the table, we commiserated about the grossness of all this and I ran to get them a couple of go-boxes and their check. Obviously the appetite was gone. 

BUT THAT'S NOT ALL FOLKS

This man had come for his biscuits-n-gravy and he was going to EAT his biscuits-n-gravy by God, because as the surly, nauseated dishwasher groaned and mopped mere feet away and milk-barf smell crawled through the room, Grandpa returned from the bathroom where he'd apparently cleaned himself up with cheap paper towels and he sat down and they proceeded to eat breakfast.

PTSD,"I've talked about this before on /r/dreams, I can't find the link right now: apologies for my disjointed language, long work-week and I'm kind of exhausted, but I need to tell someone about this.

I've been dreaming of a man and three women for years now. They always appear together, and usually in very vivid and odd dreams - the kind that feel like they came from someone else's head. The first couple of dreams happened during a dark period that might have been a psychotic episode. 

In one, I saw a man with long black hair wearing a black suit and waltzing with a woman on a vast plane or stage of black glass. Behind them was a great curved screen, also of perfect reflective black; they danced in wide arcs across the plane, and eventually in the dream two more women appeared; the three were witches, and he was the demon or warlock they gathered around. I saw them circling a fire, casting a spell; I saw a vast whirlwind tearing up the earth, destroying everything in its path, though I always felt completely safe and even jubilant about it. The idea was that I was to become a witch too, to be joined in some way to this warlock figure.

In another, I found the three women gathered together in a tiny little house which was overgrown with plants and vines. Again they were witches, and coaxing me to come into the house: I remember stopping on the porch in hesitation, and seeing a letter or placard next to the door, affixed upside down, with a man's name on it: M------ M-----. I don't recall how many letters there were but the first and last name both began with an M. 

Interestingly I had a brief lucid dream about a month ago in which the dark-haired warlock figure reappeared, very briefly: I found myself back in the room with the stage, but this time everything was a pure matte white; it looked like a room that wasn't 'loaded', like an area in a video game that loads untextured. I was lucid in this dream, and wished to see this figure; in an instant the dark-haired man was there against the white wall, still in black, standing and looking at me in surprise. I remember the startled look on his face, and his frozen posture, as if caught at something; a moment later that scene was gone again. It was the only time I saw him without his women.

--------------

They appeared again last night, for the first time in more than a year.

I recall only one scene of this dream unfortunately: I was standing in an area that seemed 'square', with a pool of some kind in it, and saw three beautiful and noble women appear, very unlike the wild-haired, hedonistic witches of former dreams. One wore blue, another wore purple and the last wore yellow. 

Soon following them came the warlock, in a very surprising context: he came wearing a very nice white suit, with white gloves and accents of gold; he was pushing a wheelchair, and in it was a thin elderly woman wearing a white gown that might have been a wedding dress. She didn't seem senile or damaged by age, but certainly close to death, if unmoved by that. It was the first time I have ever seen four women with this man.

I am absolutely dumbstruck. What in the world could this mean?

**EDIT**: I want to add that hours after making this post, the next day after I had this dream, I went to visit my father and found that he is in bad decline right now, he has a lung infection that's debilitating him, his health has taken a turn for the worse to the point that he can no longer walk.

Now genuinely I'm not honestly sure how I feel about this, but I'm going to put it down as No Regrets because at this moment that's my feeling on it. That changes. Right now, I wish I'd fucking done it. it's late, I'm tired, I'm drinking, and I wish I'd fucking done it. I come by my username honestly, I do. I wish I had taken a blood price out of that menial little shit for what he cost me in time and in peace of mind and dignity and pride. 

He didn't even deserve murder, he wasn't that cunning or devious: he was more the dumb-shit scattershot asshole narcissist than the cruel tormentor he became to me. He couldn't get into an adversarial discussion without pulling out the ugliest possible thing he could say: two years into our relationship he turned to me during an argument over video game tactics and told me 'It's not my fault your mother never loved you'. He knew fucking well my mom was bipolar and had abused me all my life. I had *confided* in him. That's what made him deserving of fucking death: he would tell me in one breath he loved me and in the second he would capitalize on every confession I ever made to him  in his double-dealing self-serving professions of 'love' to make me as miserable and useless as he was. Any time I showed any kind of energy or anger for self-defense he'd call me arrogant and crazy. At this moment and at this distance I wish I had taken a hatchet to his neck for that. He's 2000 miles away and it's safe to feel these things, I have to feel these things now. There are only two people in my whole life I would like to literally murder and he's one of them. 

Two years in I became aware of this and told him we had to separate. We were living in MY apartment, MY home, and he refused to go, and he would cry and bawl and fuck with me and weep and cry whenever I got serious about it, what was I thinking? Ten years went by; ten fucking years, and you hear me now, can I describe what I went through and what I lost over that ten years? How my happy young face waned and harrowed with age? 

No, that's a step too far, my confession tonight is that I feel the literal rage of actual fucking murder in my veins and I welcome it, it means I'm alive again, that the angry bitchilante killself I buried under seven metres of rock in those days is sucking oxygen again and ready to help me live. I negotiate anger every day of my life and that's what tells me I'm still here and I haven't been broken. He's not the first, he wasn't the last, he was the most two-faced, the most manipulative, the most insensate of his own viciousness, and for that he deserves to eat dirt. He wouldn't admit to being the asshole he was. He deserves a severed femoral, dismemberment and burial in an unmarked grave in a nameless forest ten thousand miles from every other human being he has so much contempt for. Eat worms, tiny little man.

Fuck you you meaningless limp dick, I don't care about any of the rest of it, I'd take your head off right fucking now with a machete if I could and I'd sleep like a baby direct after. You miserable sad sack of a man, what a waste of time and energy you were.

And just like that it's over. I gotta jettison this, so I'm posting it. He doesn't feel worth it now so thank you. [no regrets]. Thank you.

(edit: /r/confession's submission bot seems to have decided I feel remorse, which is probably very precognizant of it and might be applicable in 2045. At this moment I would literally take the life from that miserable little fuck and I would feel enormous relief for having done it. There is no remorse. I am so relieved to report that.)

PTSD,"It's not very often I really remember my dreams, but I usually take the memorable ones seriously, and I've had a couple of hard-to-forget, inscrutable dreams over the last week. Both of them signified death.

I dreamt last night of an apocalypse. It happened very suddenly, there was no plot leading up to it; at some point I was standing outside with a group of people and became aware of some immense shifting, something enormous happening. I looked up into the sky.

There was darkness there, as of night, but I could see the sun above, the full sphere of it visible, wreathed in what might have been clouds or fields of gas and starlight. It was bobbing faintly in the sky, as if moved by some unnatural gravity; the sky at the horizon and above was black, but there was a faintly reddish, eldritch glow surrounding the unmoored sun. 

As it shifted and moved in this untethering of its orbit, there was a great sound or feeling, and a thousand pieces of debris or what might have been planets were suddenly pulled up from below the horizon to surround the sun. They began to spin loosely around it in a weak centrifugal gravity, a belt of stony satellites that were stirred around the center of the sphere in a very realistic way. 

With that the gravity of the whole planet seemed to go haywire, as if the earth itself were being pulled toward that alien sun. There wasn't any noticeable shift in the ground itself, but the sun seemed to suddenly shoot up into the sky in a dizzying way, not moving itself but spinning the earth around so our perspective changed alarmingly. The sun shot below the level of the earth, then flew back up across it in a streak, all while the belt of satellites hovered around it unmoved. The vision was both terrifying and awe-inspiring; others in the crowd around me started to cheer in a frightened way, like scared little kids at a fireworks show putting on a front of braggadocio. There was never real vertigo or a sense of the ground shifting, it was more like the heavens themselves started spinning around us. 

That's all I remember of this. It's the second dream in a week of death; [the last one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/2m0ka3/dream_of_a_wooded_valley_in_autumn_it_felt_very/) took place in an autumnal wooded valley, and there was a moment when I looked over a small cliff into a creek and found a human skull and some bones scattered at the edge of the water.

PTSD,"I don't remember a lot of the earlier parts of this dream, but the section I want to relate has been sticking in my head for three days now. It had a feel of importance about it, so if anyone has a suggestion on what it meant I'd love to hear it. 

The important part of the dream began as I was standing at the edge of a wooded valley with my young son, who was maybe eight in the dream (sixteen in reality). We were standing at the very rim of the valley, atop a small abutment that dropped down to a creek about six to ten feet below. It wasn't a large drop, but it was too high to climb again if we went down.

In front of us this lovely, quiet open space stretched out as far as the eye could see, a gently sloping wooded area with bare trees spaced widely apart, the creek meandering through the lowest part. The ground was completely carpeted with flawless autumn leaves, red and gold and bronze, and ahead of us the sun was shining down through the branches of the trees, very bright, illuminating the valley below us.

The place seemed familiar to me in the dream, and I turned to my son and said ""This is where we saw the hedgeballs, remember? Isn't it lovely!"". 

After a moment, my son suddenly jumped down from the little cliff into the valley below: I leaned over to look after him, and when I did I noticed a human skull lying there below at the edge of the creek, with a couple of bones beside it. I had the briefest moment of misgiving, it was out of place in the perfect serenity of the scene, but I had no choice but to climb down after my son. There was a feeling of regret and resignation in doing so.

A few moments later, the scene shifted, and I found myself on a sort of balcony structure up above the valley. There was no way up or down into the valley from this balcony and I don't remember actually travelling up there. 

In front of me was a wall with a row of windows in it, and a bare, institutional room with a set of double doors on the other side of the windows. I was surrounded by other people, a small crowd gathered at the edges of the balcony as if waiting for a procession. All of them were restless and rowdy. 

Through the windows, I saw the double doors open, and a group of maybe four people came through, herding a fifth man with his hands bound roughly in front of them. The people around me erupted in angry jeering, yelling curses at the person being herded along; I understood suddenly that the man was going to be killed for some transgression, and understood also that the people around me and the man going to his death were all vampires.

 The man was pushed around a corner and out onto the balcony where I stood: the people around me jostled and yelled, suddenly energized in the high violent way of mobs, and little objects and bits of paper flew through the air to strike the man about the head and chest. The man was pushed past me, and I saw his face was drained and white, his eyes glassy with fear. He stumbled past as I stood there frozen, and suddenly motion caught my eye: through the windows I saw another man burst through the double doors, his hands out in a gesture of halting, crying out to the crowd as if trying to talk them down from this execution. He looked strained and frightened, desperate to spare the prisoner. The crowd paid no mind to him, and the captive was pushed through an arch or gateway to my right and out of sight.

And at the last minute, BM announces ""oh no, she's being a princess this year! She's had her dress for a month! Besides, you had her last year.""

It was our weekend. BM never said anything about it until the last minute. Kiddo cried, and when we picked her up after trick or treating, the poor kid looked like a prostitute. Just covered in glitter and makeup in a too-large dress that slid off her shoulder and was awkward to walk in. I felt terrible-- angry and frustrated and powerless. Nobody cared about what Kiddo wanted, or the time and money I'd invested, and I had to suck it up and be the adult and not make a thing of it. Fine.

This year, my husband tells me she wants to be this or that for Halloween and then acts confused when I say that I'd rather not participate this year.

And the kid never said a single word to us about it. Her bedroom is upstairs while the rest of the household is downstairs, and we never go in when she's not here, so we had no idea she'd been sick. It's just been *moldering* for *two weeks.*

But... she's six.

She's not remotely mature enough to understand half the reasons it upsets me, though, so rather than go on about the expense and disrespecting her possessions, I just told her that we know she knows better than to color on her brand new sheets and that we expect her to NEVER make this mistake again. She nodded, but I got the impression she didn't take it very seriously. I really hope she was listening and doesn't do this again.

It's just marker. I keep telling myself it's just marker. She's just a little kid and kids do dumb things. But boy, does it get under my skin. I feel like maybe it's easier for me to get angry at her because she's not biologically mine, but I don't have any frame of reference to determine whether that's true. I find myself rehearsing situations in which I have to discipline her (as I'm the primary caregiver when she's here due to her dad's schedule), because I worry that I'll get too wound up and lose my temper if I don't prepare ahead of time.

That only soldiers can soldier on, that only warriors fight wars, that only police have to police their own thoughts? Would you condemn me to a life without proper treatment and proper care, just because my PTSD grew slowly, over the course of years, rather than springing fully-formed from my head after one single incident?

No, of course not. We who suffer can be so much more forgiving of others than ourselves. ""Of course you 'deserve' your diagnosis! You *have* PSTD!"" That's right. And so do you. 

A diagnosis of PTSD or PTSS isn't automatically a badge of honor, something that only heroes can get. It isn't a death sentence, either.  It's merely a way to identify and treat what's happening to us, inside us. 

Schizophrenia has been described as ""a sane reaction to an insane world."" (RD Laing) I think that we could view PTSD the same way: our worlds went insane for a minute, a day, a year, a childhood, and our sane brains had to be flexible in order to cope, to *endure.* If you endured, and you lived, then you deserve to be properly diagnosed and treated. *No one* ""deserves"" PTSD.

I hope you can all be more forgiving of yourselves, and embrace your diagnoses in hopes of treating them and bringing sanity back to your worlds.

[Elliot Rodger, Gunman in California Mass Shooting, was influenced by the ""Men's Rights Movement""](http://m.dailykos.com/story/2014/05/24/1301671/-Elliot-Roger-Gunman-in-California-Mass-Shooting-was-influenced-by-the-Men-s-Rights-Movement)

Full disclosure: I was physically attacked today by a mentally ill man so my thoughts may be shaped by that.

First, I'm dismayed at this article for lambasting the MRM as being equivalent to TRP, and for making its aims sound like little more than trying to get women into bed. 

I find it incredibly disturbing that someone has internalized TRP propaganda (ya, I know I'm gonna get downvotes for that, but in this case, I can't see it any other way) and taken it to its most violent conclusion.

A part of me wants to be angry with TRPers for this.  Our society has made the American dream -wife, 2.5 kids, white picket fence - into something that we feel like we all deserve, and if we don't have it, then we have every right to be angry at the world.  Because, hey, the world owes us that.

But then TRPers exaggerate it even more. Every man -deserves- is entitled to a wife.  If he doesn't have one, it's women's fault.  It's feminism's fault.

This is how part of me wants to view TRP as being an accomplice.

But then I look at many of my mentally ill clients.  Many of them will never have a wife.  Some have expressed anger at that (today in fact).  Everyone wants to love and be loved, or at least have the opportunity to attempt to do so.  And you don't have to be mentally ill to be upset if you don't have romantic love.

But mentally ill people can sometimes be influenced to violence by any topic.  It's more frequently religious. 

And that's where I come back to my dismay at blaming MRM for this tragedy.  We would hardly blame the Catholic church for someone killing an LGBTQ person or a doctor who provides abortions, even if sometimes there is Catholic media that adopts aggressive rhetoric against both.

But we do have mentally ill and psychotic folks who internalize the anger and aggression, and then sometimes act out.

I do think it is important for internet personalities to be aware of the effect that they can have on already unstable people.  But no-one will ever be able control what others read into their thoughts and opinions.

I think on both sides we need to be more sensitive of the distinctions between those who should be seen to represent the extremes, and those who represent the varied but mainstream ideals of the movements.  We do a disservice to both movements when we scapegoat each other, and blame the tragic or unjust actions of individuals on MRM or Feminism(s).

We do need to be aware of the repercussions of expressing our views, but we should not allow blame to be placed at our, or the others feet.

Those are my thoughts anyway.  I know some others tend to be a bit more passionate than me.",AWholeBucketofStars

Are there many other instances of square shapes naturally occurring?

PTSD,"I've been looking for a different job for a little while now.  I'm currently a mental health case worker, but the inner workings of my team are so dysfunctional that most of my coworkers who are young enough to do so are either actively searching or considering employment elsewhere.  

I was really starting to get disheartened by the lack of prospects out there.  But a few days ago I found my dream job with an interfaith NGO working to address inner city issues.  And I'm pretty sure I meet at least the minimum qualifications, and that I have enough other experience to excel in it.

I've never wanted a job anywhere near as much as I want this one.  So naturally I've started fantasizing about how it might be and the kinds of work I might do.

I know I need to be preparing myself more for if I don't get it. I'm pretty sure I'll be upset, I just hope not so despondent that I give up on looking elsewhere.

PTSD,"So my son and I got a stomach bug last week.  He'd been getting better, stopped throwing up on Saturday and the fevers haven't really been coming back.

But he had diarrhea yesterday at school (his first day back) so bad that I had to pick him up.  When I took him to the doctor, she said that I need to start letting him eat whatever he wants.  Even dairy, so he can heal from the sickness.  

Now he's throwing up again.  -_-    I have quite literally no one in this state who can help me with him when he's sick.  I had his grandparents out here for a visit Fri and Sat, and they helped out then, but they had to drive back to their home 11 hours away on Sunday.

I'm out of PTO time.  My work has productivity standards which I havent been meeting in my best months (no one who doesnt work unreported overtime does though), and this illness has set me back even more.  

I'm so screwed.  Why did I think I could live so far from family on my own.

How do you all handle long drawn out illnesses?

I don't know what to do.


Edit:  Thank you everyone for the advice!  Turns out my son has rotavirus.  

He spread it throughout his preschool in the 2 hours he was there on Monday (Oops... o.O).  His teacher has it, but called me today to let me know I can bring him in tomorrow if his symptoms seem better since half the kids are out sick now anyway.

I took my son in to work with me for a couple hours today while I delivered meds to clients.  

I dropped off a dr's note with my 2 supervisors and they seemed pretty understanding.  I suspect that my coworker's news about taking a job elsewhere helped my situation.

PTSD,"Since I've been a teenager, I've been told by various people, ""I don't know why, but I can just talk to you."" as though it's something special.  

People confide things to me, and I can only assume it has something to do with my infp nature. Sometimes what they share is heartfelt, sometimes it's embarrassing, sometimes it's fearful or terrifying.  All too often, people say things to me like, ""I've never told anyone this before..."" or ""I feel like I can just be myself with you and don't have to hide anything.""

When I was younger, it was overwhelming, especially the terrible things I heard from friends, acquaintances and even complete strangers.  

These days, I find it's very helpful in my current job in mental health; some clients have opened up more for engagement and treatment with me than they have in years.  My mentor tells me it would serve me well and suits me for a career in ministry, which I hope to pursue one day.

My problem is that in my romantic relationships this has been a common refrain as well and it has me sort of jaded.  

Where the people I've loved have been able to open up and confide in me like ""never before,"" they see it as evidence of the special and enduring nature of our relationship. I can't help but question that because of how much weight they place on being able to confide in me... just like everyone else.

PTSD,"I was working ship's security and we were having a large ""morale-boosting"" muster (all 200+ of us -watchstanders) with none other than our dear salty Ship's Security Senior Chief (E8).

Now it had been a long deployment and in the 7 short months between our last and next deployments, we spent a majority if it out to sea on the required pre-deployment work-ups and trainings (didn't we just do these?).  

Meanwhile, those of us in security were still working 13-14 hour days the few times we were actually in port.  Folks were going AWOL/deserting (2 shipmates just from my 45 man section), making stupid mistakes like abandoning post while the Captain walked through or ""accidentally""discharging weapons into the leg, in addition to the usual but increasing fights with watch commanders...  Needless to say, even the most gung ho of us were getting irritable and morale was low (you know the feeling, I'm sure).

So Senior Chief calls a muster in the hangar bay.  We haven't been home much, so his own wife and teenage son were visiting and standing off to the side of us in ranks.  Senior starts into what is supposed to be one of those morale-boosting, Hoo-ah! speeches about how we're here for a reason, we're getting those no-good ragheads, we've got a mission to take care of and each of us are an integral part, blah blah blah.  Ok.

Then that old salt says something I will never forget...

""Now listen up! I love my family. I have them with me here today because, yeah, we haven't seen each other much in a while.  My wife, I love you honey, and my son, I'm so proud of you.  It's hard being away, but we do it because we signed up for this.

""Now I love my family, *but I love the Navy more.* And each one of you should too.  If you don't love the Navy more than you love your families, then you need to ask yourself what you're doing here.""

O.o

Unless my memory fails me, I'm pretty sure the number of deserters jumped after that little speech.  As an in-port security watch sup, I couldn't blame 'em either. Senior told 'em to make the choice.

PTSD,"That's the thought that keeps finding itself into my head that I am trying so hard to overcome. Things have been hurting me lately. Situations that are hard to stay positive in. 

Since learning about and practicing the law of attraction in my everyday life I say I have made a complete 180 in my way of thinking. I used to me depressed, angry, negative, apathetic, hateful, judgmental, I felt like a victim to life. But since learning about LOA I guess you could say I've gotten a little obsessive. It's basically my religion Now. It makes me feel happy and fulfilled. I showed my parents The Secret and have been leading my family & friends in the direction of positivty and love. Sort of like a disciple. 

I try to live LOA in all that I do. Obviously I am not perfect but I consciously try as much as I can. I have been meditating, visualizing, affirmating, choosing not to partake in destructive or hurtful behaviors, avoiding gossip and negative thoughts, detaching myself from toxic influences, I pray often, even if it just to say thank you. I am always reminding myself of ways to be grateful. I try to look at the bright side of things, to see the bigger picture. I try to not judge others. I try to live a life of love and positivity wherever & whenever possible. But most of all, I am learning to love myself & love life. 

But, things have been hard lately. I know it is all about perception and I know sorta blaming yourself is not what loving yourself looks like but since watching The secret I almost feel personally responsible for everything that happens. Then I wonder, why is manifesting something bad so much easier? I think 80% positive thoughts, the other 20% of negative thought I am still catching myself and trying to turn positive. 

A little background.. my 45 year old dad made a career change from a financial advisor entrepreneur to crossfit coach entrepreneur. I crossfit and have been helping him build this business. It is what him and I are passionate about. Helping others. The business is full of love and positivty but you dont even need a high school diploma to run it so it's not making nearly as much money as the financial service business. My family is torn. My mom wants to support him but it is hard with these bills and expenses and owing so many people money to stay afloat is starting to put a wedge between them. Tension is high when money is low. I work there basically for free because I know they will pay me back one day I'm hoping. I had $3000 saved up (I am good with money) that my dad asked if he could borrow it to pay for the crossfit annual fee bc he didn't have it. I said yes. I got a serving job but it was so negative I hated it. We are a family of 5, one sister is passionate about volleyball so there are expenses there. the other sister in in college that my parents have been helping to support. 

My family is stressed and I find myself being the rock. telling them to just think positive and do what makes you happy and everything will be okay. I believe it... but it's hard seeing more and more crumble around you. My dad just says ""everything will be okay"" but my mom says you should be blind and irresponsible. 

My credit card is maxed out for the first time in my life. My car broke down and it will take $1000 to fix. I am struggling to buy Xmas presents. I also have been depressed to the max at my losing of my most precious object I owned. I have always been good at taking personal responsibility but it just hurts. I know it is not good to love material items but my Pandora bracelet had charms that loved ones have been giving to me over the years. I find myself for the first time in a while thinking thoughts of anger at the universe. Then I get scared because I am superstitious. always have been. I have looked everywhere for that bracelet. I am trying my hardest to think positively that it will come back but I wonder what I did to have my favorite object in the whole world that meant so much to me just vanish. It's hard to stay positive when my car is breaking down and none of us have the money to fix it. Everyone is stressed and yelling at each other. I continuously try my hardest to be positive and keep hope and be the support for the family ... Am I being tested? am I missing something? Any insight would be great. thanks for the read

PTSD,"I come across more and more people who go under the knife to get gastric bypass and remove their stomach instead of going to overeaters anonymous to deal with WHY they over eat,  exercising & changing their food habits. It seems backwards to me. Those who deal with the emotional issue in why they are overweight while they change their lifestyle and become more active is the answer to weight loss. 

I met a woman at work who said she lost 150lbs and I was blown away and so proud of her. I am in the fitness industry so I naturally assumed she changed her habits and that is an incredible story. Later she told a story about how she had two misscarrages in the past and she decided to make a change so her and her husband got weight loss surgery. All of a sudden all her credibility to me is lost. For some reason, to me there's no pride in that. 

Idk, just to me, it is absolutely absurd that people are more comfortable going into risky surgery to remove their bodily organs  instead of getting to the root of their problem and changing their habits. I don't want to be judgmental but being in the fitness industry, having been to overeaters anonymous myself, having changed my habits ... and watched other overweight people change their life and lose weight by hard work and determination... I just feel judgmental and see weight loss surgery as fixing the symptom not the problem... CMV . I dont like feeling judgmental.",mcrfreak78
PTSD,"I was at a terrible place for most of my life. Close minded, judgmental, victim mindset, toxic friendships, self loathing, I struggled with depression, anxiety and more for several years. 

My parents would unknowingly preach the law of attraction and ""power of positive thinking"" at me but I didn't understand what the fuck they meant. I couldn't fathom anything beyond my suffering mind. After a long hard road of hitting rock bottom several times I finally started to get help and the world was opening up to me. 

Long story short, A year ago, I didn't really know what LOA was, I mean I would listen to Wayne Dyer W my Mom but that was it. But then it started to unfold. The synchronicities..Then one day, Rhonda Byne's ""The Secret"" Full CD set found it's way to me. I was ecstatic. Like I was just meant to listen. Its like all the answers I was looking for found it's way to me. The struggling in life was over. Like I was just remembering what I already knew. 

It suddenly started to make so much sense I watched angry hateful loathing people in my life spiral downhill and manifest disaster after disaster in their life..almost as if they like playing victim and living like that. I saw those with passion in their souls and whom abandoned fear and went for what they wanted do amazing in life and brought more and more blessings to them. 

I Now pretty much an obsessed with LOA and practically do everything to practice and study it. I am more than just intrigued it just resonates with me so deeply. I see so many people though who just hate the idea, they don't only pou pou it but they have strong hateful opinions on it. But most people believe in karma right? I feel like its basically the same thing but for some reason the idea of karma has come across as more accepted than the idea of LOA. I have a feeling my friend's think I'm crazy, they just haven't said anything. I tell them to watch The Secret. I had the sequal ""the power"" on my bedstand and a close friend of mine (who is just as spiritual as me just not as open about it) picked it up and started reading it and was like ""OMG what a bunch of crap.. it says Love is a force"" and I said it is and he snickered and said ""why do you believe everything you read""

Even if this shit WASNT real and WAS all a big hoax. It makes me happy and isn't hurting anyone. So why not take a chance at feeling legit whole. I have a whole different attitude and mindset and way of looking at the world. It gave me power over my own life. This stuff makes me happy. And feel complete. and Whole. I mean.. What's NOT comforting about the idea we can shape our own destiny? We are not doomed for poverty, addiction, obesity, a shitty life... The Secret & LOA has taught me that we don't HAVE to be victims. Life doesnt HAVE to be hard and depressing and challenging. Life is your catalogue. You are the Co-creator.. yet SO many people just REFUSE to believe that. Like ive just seen so much negativity and hate towards the idea. I just can't understand how this is not comforting to other people as it was to me? i feel like I have found what I have been searching for my whole life and now, I am the artist and the world is my canvas... 

TLDR;  Why does it feel like SO many people are so hateful towards what The Secret is teaching?",mcrfreak78
PTSD,"for example, I went on a crystal trip and a lady was taking about black obsidian. I didn't know much about it.

I went home and read about black obsidian in The Crystal Bible & Oh my god it does look intense. like terrifying. I personally don't have an expierence with it but dear god I'm sure someone does. 

The only thing I can really think of personally is recently I have been trying to clear emotional ties & gunk that I no longer need. The use of prayer meditation and crystals I'm trying to rid myself of what no longer serves me deep inside that may be blocking my true potential. I haven't had a freak out meltdown in a while I have been feeling very level headed and happy.. but a couple days ago my sister took my clothes and didnt give them back and I flipped shit i had so much anger inside me I trashed her room and started screaming and crying but it didn't feel like it was because of the clothes it felt deeper. like way deeper. earlier that day I was wearing sugalite I asked it to clear me off people places & things I was still connected to that I no longer needed. I also wore malachite and smokey quartz. the next day i wore some kyanite and malachite and had another blow up at my sister.

No idea whether it was the stones, the fact I'm on a diet, have quit smoking, or just randomly snapped... all I know is I haven't felt connected recently. it feels like PMS x10. But I know it is not.

PTSD,"on month 6 of accutane. 60mg. 

Call me crazy.. but my previous addictions & compulsions have come out 10 fold since starting accutane it seems. 

Ive always liked drinking. so much that it has gotten me in trouble. I got a dui n went to jail for a little bit. I was on probation for 9 months n only drank like three times in that 9 months. pretty good for someone who has gone thru times of drinking every day or every weekend. I also was eating healthy and I have been a social smoker (ciggs) for like 5 years. 

I started accutane in early January. I got off probation in april. But since starting accutane my gluten and sugar and eating compulsion has gotten worse. I even have gone to a couple Overeaters anonymous meetings because I feel so out of control with food and sugar lately. Ive always struggled with food issues but I have never felt so helpless. 

I would smoke a couple ciggs here and there. Have gone through times in my life where I smoked more often but would never have a problem quitting or cutting back. ive never been a pack a day smoker. Maybe like Max 6 a day at the most. 

my dog died in March and instead of drinking or eating I bought a pack of cigarettes and have had trouble quitting ever since. It really really fucked me up. Devistated is an understatement. Ive been on and off smoking occasionally since I was 16 but never fully addicted but now I am snuggling to quit or cut back.

Also picking my face has gotten worse. 

Then I got off probation and turned 21 in May. I was so excited was drinking socially going out w friends a lot then ive started to fall back into bad habits again. 

I got a new job bartending where I work nights and I don't get off work till late. I have my shift drink then maybe by another then go home n drink a beer or margarita. Maybe cuz I turned 21? Idk but ik if I want to drink I get anxious. It worrys me. 

Since starting accutane I am tired ALL THE TIME. Just worn out. I read that people who are tired or sleep deprived have no will power and crack under addictions. Which is part of the reason why it is so hard for alcoholics to quit. when they pass out from drinking they arent getting restful sleep and cannot make the decision to not drink. 

That's my theory.. n also that I heard accutane can increase anxiety. I have had anxiety since kindergarten and am medicated for it. but only from like antidepressants. I do feel more anxious and tired. could that be the reason I feel helpless to a lot of compulsions? Thank u for reading.

PTSD,"So I get a HUGE dose of inspiration and creativity from my Adderall and ALL this amazing projects and things to do keep pop pop popping in my head. Oh the ideas!! The motivation!! I quickly get a piece of paper to scribble down all the bursts of inspiration so that I do not forget them! The list grows and grows as I keep writing down what I can do to make this perfect. 


The extremist personality gathers up as many supplies as it can. The more the better right?! I am going to get so much done!!! But it has to be PERFECT. I am going to do this HUGE task to perfection. Whatever that means. 

But wait..why is it taking so long?? I've been working on this for hours...days...WEEKS..why isnt this project getting finished?? 

Suddenly I look around me. What have I done!! There is SO much to do!! So much clutter.. I bit off more than i could chew!! Ive wasted so much time doing what doesn't need to be done but what my brain told me to do!! 

Anxiety quickly sets in..Time to distract myself. Ahh now that my mind is temporarily away from this huge mess of a started project.. I feel better. Until its time to snap back to reality. It feels like there hasn't even been a dent made in what i was suppose to do. So I crash and burn. Oh no now I feel even WORSE! I have wasted precious time! I am doubly anxious. So I distract myself again and go into the vicious cycle.

Boss gives me a ""simple"" task..but you know me. What is simple? I want to GO HARD OR GO HOME. THIS needs to be done to get THIS done then THIS then the task will be done. But since I strive for perfection..it doesnt get finished. Boss asks where is that thing I asked you to do?? Im working on it!! How long does it take?? Ahhh anxiety!!! So much to do not enough time!!! But it feels like I have been working on it for an eternity!!

Sounds farmiliar? Haha. Anxious, extremist, ADHD'er here! When I first heard the concept of ""simplicity"" & ""minimalism"" it completely blew my mind. But I thought more is better? Turns out..No. We cannot handle more. When inspiration strikes..We bite off more than we can chew. We over complicate everything. We want it to be PERFECT..but just end up wasting time and crashing and burning so it NEVER gets finished!

Whats this magic quote? Well.. I didn't say THAT but..it definitely has helped me. My Dad..who is actually my boss too..told me ""Done is better than perfect.""

What is this CRAZY statement?? You are asking me to strive for LESS than perfection? You are asking me to go half-asked on something?!?! 

But..I decided to give it a try. When I found myself wasting time doing things that *I* deemed to be appropriate for said project.. I have found myself telling myself to keep it simple..and ""Done is better than perfect"" 

Telling myself that has helped my brain weed out what is actually important and not so important in getting something done. Is this REALLY the most important thing I can be doing right now? Ask yourself that. 

Done IS better than perfect.. Because done is better than un-finished ""perfection"" ..whatever that means. And you can always go back and work on it when you have more time. But at least you know it is done.

I hope I was some help. You can do it fellow ADHD'ers.. I believe in you.. now ATTACK THE DAY :)

PTSD,"I'm completely ashamed of my diet & borderline feel powerless. I live at home with my family and food is on the healthy side, I make health smoothies and get cooked paleo dinners, but I feel like I have this crazy carb/sugar addiction. If somebody makes the smallest comment about my eating or food habits i go belistic defense mode. I have tried countless times to completely quit/cut out the bad shit & clean up my eating but I don't know why I struggle so fucking much with it. I've had a clean diet in the past so where the hell did that will power go? it feels like i have none anymore and it makes me hate myself. 

Its screwed up. I was raised eating healthy. We never went out for fast food or kept junk food at home. I have never fully quit sugar successfully for more than a couple days if that. I love cereal, nutella, ice cream, candy, peanut butter, chocolate milk, cookies, pb& j's.. I remember there have been times in my life where i haven't eaten cereal or chocolate milk etc for a long ass time..sorta forgot about them. But I feel like it is spiraling out of control. Like on a binge. Ive had eating disorders in the past. Anorexia in high school and bulimia on and off for atleast 5 years of my life. Once in a blue moon i get the urge to purge but dont because just wreaked absolute havok on my body. 

For breakfast and sometimes after dinner I eat like 3 bowls of cereal then feel tired, crabby, & sick. I feel guilt because i have a sister in high school who wants some cereal sometimes and she will go and it will be all gone. I come home late after cleaning the crossfit box and even if there is a paleo dinner waiting for me my brain just tells me it Isn't satisfied even if i am full. Sometimes I drive to a mcdonalds 8 miles away from my house at night because i have a reputation of crossfit box owner in my home town and dont want anybody to see me getting sweet tea, ice cream and cookies. 

Is it a mind fuck or is body playing some messed up tricks on me? Honestly I feel completely insane. Like a drug addict. I feel the guilt even before I put it in my mouth but somehow it doesn't stop me. The fucked up part is I 100% believe in the power of our diet and how what we choose to eat has such a powerful impact of our body and mind. I even want to go to school. So I'm telling people not to drink energy drinks and eat fast food because i whole-heartily believe it ..but I just don't practice what I preach and I'm so incredibly frustrated.

Being an co-owner and coach of a crossfit box I feel ashamed... guilty... like a failure to our members bc most of them eat soooo well and have such good self control and I envy that and have rage against myself. I should be leading by example and inspiring others and I beat myself up because why cant I just cut it out??? I bought the 21 day sugar detox book and got overwhelmed. I tell myself every single day I am going to eat right but always end up disappointing myself. 

The only reason I am not huge (well I was at one point) is Ive been crossfitting for a year and a half and live a very active lifestyle. Ive always been on adderall for years which suppressed appetite during the day. Everywhere else on my body has reshaped itself...except I have a gut. I know if i ate clean i wouldnt have a gut. You'd think i have all the motivation in the world to ignore cravings...you would think..i ask my self every god damn day what my fucking problem is and what is it gonna take to get my shit together. Especially since I used to eat well in the past.

I know its easy to look at this post and say ""JUST QUIT. ITS THAT EASY"" Id probably be looking judging myself and say ""JUST STOP EATING LIKE SHIT DUMBASS"" But really why am I having such a hard time with it. I feel absolutely insane. Thanks for reading. xoxo",mcrfreak78

PTSD,"I'm going to try my hardest to make this as short and to the point as possible but there is just so much so I apologize in advance. 

like so a year ago I got a DUI and I have to go to Alcoholics Anonymous for probation. last summer I met a guy at AA and he made me feel like for the first time in my life that he genuinely really liked me. we started hanging out more and more then we just sorta considered each other bf and gf. but it was so hard because he didn't have a car and he was in a sober living home where you're not allowed to have girlfriends. so we would always have to sneak around and he would get in trouble and it just caused so much  stress on the relationship.

so we're together for maybe two months but we didn't hang out as often. his roommate later told me he was depressed. then one weekend he calls me up nd says that he's going back to his hometown he's moving back with his parents because he doesn't want to live in the sober living home anymore so at that point I was too hurt he was talking to me in a really mean way I was crying so hard so then I just cut him off we didn't talk for a while.

this January comes around and ive been thinking of him a lot. wondering how he's doing. praying for him. then we got in contact again and started talking. he started a new career doing tile work and works a lot of hours and we got back together because he said he never stopped caring about me he misses me a lot and we can have a future together because he is getting his career up and running and has all these goals and aspirations so I believed him for a while or not a while but for a little bit things were good. I felt like I was on cloud nine even though it was like a long distance relationship because he lived an hour away but he would come see me on the weekends

He didn't go to any meetings when he lived with his parents he was 20 almost 21 and the relationship got real bad real fast we couldn't go a day without fighting he made me cry almost every day lied to me being shady as fuck treating me like Shit while his drinking progressively got worse and worse. he was  spiraling downward blacking out every night doing real fucked up shit.he was at Rock bottom. wed break up for a couple days and then I'll call him on the phone crying he would tell me he wanted help but then a couple days later call me back and said he didn't want help he just wanted to die and end his misery he was hopeless no one loved him and he felt like a piece of Shit for what he was putting me thru so he was breaking up with me to do me a favor because I deserve better and why would I want to be with a lying shitty alcoholic.

I don't know why I was so upset but since going to AA I've realized that my whole life I struggle with codependency. I was in an abusive relationship when I was 19 for a year and he ended up beating me he cheated on me I was miserable physically and emotionally abusive. and I realized it was the perfect codependent relationship. I pretty much struggled with codependency in all aspects of my life because I'm extremely insecure no self worth or self esteem I've got a delicate ego because I have a lot of issues I struggle everyday to deal with my codependency and it has been getting better and I'm constantly working on it.

So after kyle breaks up with me I am crying and crying and I knew that we should have broken up I knew I couldn't be with him but I thought he wanted help & I knew we were going to break up and I was just putting it off as long as I could because I was scared to deal with the pain.

So the same night he calls me up fucked up wasted and told me I am a crazy psychotic and I'm messed up in the head and never to talk to him again n i said OK and surprisingly that made me stop crying cuz it showed me who he is. so I cut him off but I'm still praying for him and thinking a lot bout him. 

Soooo yesterday calls me up and is sober. he said that he checked himself into rehab. the past two times he went to rehab it was cuz his parents threatened to kick him out & then he got a dui n was forced to be sober but this time he actually did it for himself & doesn't wanna live that life anymore & wanna be happy & he's back in a sober living home & is going to meeting every day and is actually going to actually start work program 

He said he'd understand if I never wanted to talk to him or see him again but the guilt was eating him up so he needed to tell me how sorry was n how bad he felt for how he treated me but said even making that amends doesn't take away the pain of realizing how hurt he made me. I know he's a good hearted person with a bad problem.. alcoholism. he's sick. it changes people & makes em do fucked up things & decisions. 

I've never heard him sound so genuine and sincere in my life.  i can tell he feels so terrible for losing me bc i was the only one by him when he was at Rock bottom but I don't know how I feel about this. my heart & head are confused. Ive told him I love him before n yesterday I was like crying a little to him cuz I have been thinking of him the whole time praying for him even when we didn't talk. I was worried & sad bc i don't think anyone should go through that.

I told him thank you that means alot & I forgive him. He asked if I could give him one more final chance to make me happy and prove to me he is serious about getting sober and wants a future with me & wants to try to fix the damage he left behind but I said no atleast not now I'm not ready to go thru that again.   even if he did stay sober and got his shit together and got his own place and continues stay sober like what kind of person would I be I told him this I said I'm not going to get back with you again he was like really upset like he respects & understands but he's there if I ever need him & that he misses me so much and said he can't stand the thought of never seeing me again. 

I'm not innocent in the relationship tho. There have been times where I crossed the line or I deserved to be dumped but wasn't. When things started to get bad in the relationship (I don't even believe in name calling well... I suppose I thought I didn't... :/ ) He's simple minded and I used to call him & ask if he was stupid and simple and sorta told him I thought he was n he didn't retaliate. I'd call him asshole then like the day we broke up before we did I told him I didn't even like him that much & said something like have fun being a ""diseased alcoholic waste of space"" or something mean and he just said ""wow thanks""
he's never asked how many guys I've slept with. when we broke up I fucked his old roommate. he'd get really pissed of if somebody hurt me and said to tell him if anyone hurts me bc he'll ""fuck them up"" I said why n he said I'll always protect you.. I've had random anxiety attacks and he's held me and talked me through them. he's put up with my bossy ass. first time we dated he handed me his phone to hold and I have trust and snooping issues cuz I caught over and over my last ex cheating on me thru his phone so I went thru Kyle's phone n he got sad he was like ""that means u don't trust me"" I expected him to dump me cuz I'd dump a guy who went thru my phone but I started crying and apologizing n he held me.

Any thoughts advice input on my story is appreciated. IDK what to do. its so hard being a codependent love fucks with your head n you cant think straight but is it really love or just love the idea of being loved? ugh. anyways thanks so much for reading xoxo 

TLDR; alcoholic ex finally decides to get treatment and calls to apologize for everything he put me through. wants one more chance to be the boyfriend I deserve. but do I love him or am I settling",mcrfreak78
PTSD,"I swear to god I have positive and optimistic this whole time and I keep telling myself that it will clear up soon my dermatologist said I will start to like the results starting in the third month and on I am on 60 milligrams 20 in the morning 40 at night. I am 20 y.o female weighing 160lbs.

I use the oil cleansing method with pure argan oil a couple times a week at night I also take a hot washcloth to my face then a cold washcloth to my face once or twice a day I don't wear much makeup I don't know I don't like washing my face with soap it's too rough. I like the oil cleansing method because it helps with blackheads but it seems like one day I completely washed my face of my makeup put lotion on it went to bed happy that I was starting to see some progress. Have been using clean pillowcases on my pillow every night thinking maybe that was the problem . 

my face started to look good then all the sudden boom I have like 10 new cysts on my face painful large angry swollen red... I'm miserable am I fucking missing something here what am I doing wrong I asked my dermatologist if I should change my diet or habits or something she said no diet doesn't matter I am very active I work out all the time I crossfit  almost everyday I don't drink I get 8 hours of sleep every night I try to eat as good as I can I just have no idea what to fucking do.

Nobody told me how to properly deal with a cyst/pimple. I've tried to keep my hands off of them as long as I can but Its hard with the ones on my forehead I look like Frankenstein and they're just so big and swollen and puffy I just I can't not squeeze it and let the shit out. I have to wear a hat all the time to hide my deformed face. 

The ones on my cheeks are easier to hold back from popping because the skin is not as tight and painful as they are on my forehead but honestly like what am i doing wrong I seriously have no clue I'm going to the dermatologist in a couple days to soon to start my 4th month.

Like shit like the second most popular post on this thread is of a girl with terrible acne her first month and then like perfect glowing flawless skin her second month & for fucks sake my skin wasn't as bad as her  whiteheads are not my problem. But I do have  like 10 cysts on my face that just come up and I have no idea why what can I do how do I even properly deal with a pimple.

Also i always remember havinf acne but I have been looking at pictures of my face from a year, 3 .. 6 ..years ago and can tell my condition wasn't as miserable as it is now. Like fucking why? I used to abuse my body in every way possible but like the past year I have made a complete 180 so i just don't get it. I may have gotten a cyst on my face often but I don't remember struggling with so fucking many. 

Im not losing hope but tbh I'm struggling. I have never felt more ugly in my life that not even makeup or band aids can help. Im sick of looking like a disgusting deformed freak. Can anybody help cheer me up.. sorry just needed to vent thank you so much accutane fam<3 xoxo.",mcrfreak78
PTSD,"I've been on adderall the past maybe four years switching between XR & IR & gradually having to build the dosage over the past years. I am seeing a psychiatrist. last year I was doing really well on 30mg XR then last summer I didn't feel like it was affecting me as well and the XR were too expensive but i wasnt prescribed them for like a couple months last year because it was too expensive but anyways so i was on 30mg XR for a while but insurense was fucked up and she prescribed me 20mg IR tablets to take twice a day which I am on now and have been on since the fall or beginning of winter I believe and it was so helpful I was getting that euphoric motivation Buzz all day and got so much done and didn't wanna eat at all but recently idk why but it seems my appetite started slowly coming back when I take it which is weird bc on adderall I could have my favorite meal in front of me and not want a bite so that was the first thing I started to notice so I have been expierementing with it when to take it before meals, after meals, empty stomach etc. 

Also recently I have noticed I slowly stopped getting that euphoric get stuff done buzz that helps me out and my impulsivity is back and my whole life ive had a problem with a filter and saying the wrong things and not knowing it and adderall has always helped with my inpulsivity I could take one and have complete confidence that I wasn't going to offend anybody which is extremely important because I am a CrossFit coach and manager of a CrossFit box and I am always stressing out that I am going to say or do the wrong thing and offend accidentally one of our clients and it's been extremely bad recently. I've noticed my parents and people looking at me telling me that what I just said wasn't appropriate and its just starting to happen more and more I haven't had this problem in a while and this is when I am on my adderall and I can't figure out why.. 

Adderall has also calmed me down because I am extremely hyper and loud and obnoxious which turns people off about me but adderall has always helped me be more level headed and normal and even-keeled but I don't even feel like it is doing that anymore. I take it every day even on the weekends twice a day as told to from my psychiatrist because even on the weekends I want to get stuff done but I feel like it's just not doing what it used to do. 

Are break-periods mandatory? Should I take a break from because my tolerance got to high? If so how long? Is building a tolerance to Adderall inevitable or do I need to raise the dosage? Raising the dosage will cost more. Do I need to keep raising it as long as I'm on adderall? Or am I doing something wrong? is it my diet? if anyone else had this experience and can give me some knowledge of this I would highly appreciate it.

ive been extremely stressed out and insecure about my social skills which is so important when you're an entrepreneur. & before you tell me. I will talk to my psychiatrist next time I see her. please help me thank you

edit: p.s I've tried all the other meds too vyvanse (which I liked but was SO totally expensive,) concerta & Ritalin (I didn't like..) so far addie has helped me the best other than vyvanse and any other ones will probably be really expensive?

PTSD,I got in an accident when I was 16 cuz i looked at my phone and looked out the window and drifted off. I got a dui because (no joke) I had swerved because I was texting a guy & happened to have alcohol in my system(under 21). Not to long ago I drove into a snow bank on the side of the road while texting and dug my car out with a mini shovel for an hour. I feel this OVERPOWERING NEED to be on my phone when I drive EVEN THOUGH I KNOW HOW WRONG IT IS. please don't lecture me i want to stop but it like an addiction because I get so BORED while driving.

PTSD,been on accurate for two weeks. not just bags under eyes but all around darkness it's a bit concerning.

PTSD,"Hey all! I couldn't be happier to FINALLY get my accutane today. Ugh its been a clusterfuck nightmare! I am in the middle of switching insurances and have been fighting with obamacare, insurance companies, various pharmacies, & wack discount cards for forever! Ugh but I finally have it! But I have some concerns.

I don't wear makeup. I really don't wash my face & when I do its once in a while with coconut oil. I used to over-wash and over-load my face with everything, and it made it very unhappy. I feel like cleansers irritate my skin and give me cysts :( I feel its much happier when I leave it alone and my natural moisture comes back when I don't strip it with soap.

I also have dry, frizzy, damaged, almost ethnic hair that I don't wash or use ANY product or heat on. I use the ""water-only"" method and its done miracles in helping with my scalp oil production and adding life, bounce & shine to my once dead mop. I don't use ANY product because I can't wash it out with just water and it makes it goopy, heavy and disgusting. I am happy with the results I have gotten from going all natural.

But I am worried. Accutane drys out EVERYTHING right? So will it make my hair go right back to were it once was? Will I have to go back to using product? Ugh Is there anything I can do? And will I be forced to wash my face? How often? Once or twice a day? Could use some input & any experiences you may have on this matter. Thank you so much!",mcrfreak78

PTSD,"As if having PTSD wasn't difficult to deal with as it is, the uneducated people we tell can just create so much more anxiety.

I was in a long mentally emotionally & physically abusive relationship with someone I loved so much & thought loved me too. Long story short he was the typical lying manipulative power hungry abuser who beat me and tried to kill me, twice, by strangulation. The ONLY thing he didn't do was force sex onto me. Except maybe once in the beginning he made me feel like shit & sorta verbally abused me because I rejected him, which hurt me, a LOT. & one time I was laying on my side, naked, & he sort of, um.. sodomized me for a few minutes. I was crying quietly  & finally he noticed & asked what was wrong & I'm like that hurts me I don't like it & he claimed he didn't know I didn't want it. So there were those two small incidents, but other than that I was almost ALWAYS the one trying to get him to put out. But I digress, I could go on for days about how messed up the relationship was, but no need really to get into it right now.

So anyways, I've been out of the relationship for 3 months now. The PTSD didn't develop right away & I was just recently diagnosed.

Two weeks after we broke up, I started exercising my single freedom & trying to rebound on several guys thinking it'd make me feel better. It did more damage than good (I mean, not that sleeping around is considered good, I just at the time thought it would help me get over stuff). 

I haven't been able to have pleasant sex since the breakup. I've tried several times. Its devastating because I used to love it sooooo much, i still do, & used to crave it several times a day. Now, it's dry, painful, sandpaper-y & I have cried right in the middle of it a couple times. The humiliation & shame is just as painful, if not worse, as getting poked when it's dryer than a desert. Sometimes, if I am lucky, it will be mediocre at best. Still painful, but just enough to clench my teeth & wait for it to be over. I didn't know what to think at first. Was it due to the alcohol? Lack of foreplay? Was I really not over him like I thought? It wasn't until I did some research on PTSD (right here on Reddit actually) that I realized emotional trauma can affect the body in more ways than I thought. The trust issues & fear of intimacy are devastating, & I hope that time and therapy will get me to open up to & trust people again.

Anyways, since the breakup a lot of guys have been trying to get with me and recently I have had to fess up & tell them I can't have sex. They'll be like ""Why"" & I'll hate to say ""Post Traumatic Stress Disorder"" because NOBODY understands. Only 1 person, a rape victim friend of mine who experienced PTSD aswell, has not judged me so far. Even my best friend, ex roommate (who was also in an abusive relationship & saw mine happen alongside hers), & other friends have hinted that I am just ""stressed out"".

A couple guys have been supportive and accepting (or so they say) & a few not so much. One even yelled at me & basically called me a slut because I told him I wasn't into it. Its really upsetting how he reacted. Not to mention I feel bad for the guys who get all excited & ready then have to stop in the middle. Plus who wants to be known as the girl who ""cant have sex"" or ""doesn't get wet"" or ""cries during"" Smh. I am so ashamed of this sometimes I don't even feel like a woman. I really miss the feeling of being intimate with someone I care about. Not just laying there trying to think of something else waiting for him to be done. It's extremely upsetting that my ex has the power to take that away from me.

People are not educated I feel like. Most just think that war veterans are the only ones who can get PTSD. Most think it's just mental and doesn't have any physical effects on a person. People I have told I feel like think it is a crock of bull because, I mean, in their mind, how can someone who has not been in war have PTSD?. & even if she did have it, its not like her boyfriend RAPED her.. so what does sexual disfuntion have to do with it? Or worse. ""It's all in your head. You just need to relax."" Sigh.

Sorry this might have turned into a little bit of a rant, but I want to know if anyone is in the same boat. I don't want to just keep it to myself but someone who has not gone through this doesn't understand what it is like. Should I just deal? Anyone had similar situations? 

TLDR; Anyone else feel misunderstood, anxious, ashamed etc when they tell others about their PTSD? How do you deal?

EDIT: I'd like to mention that (and I just realized this shit this weekend) that I can't even get aroused. I can't feel pleasure even during foreplay. Its like all the pleasure nerves are just turned off. Its either just uncomfortable or numb.

The fucked up part is...after all of this shame and humiliation and pain I have put myself through trying to do it so many times with several guys...is I still find myself hoping to have sex.. all the time.

It's pretty confusing.. like how could a girl who basically just fails at it almost every time still have such a hard time saying no when the opportunity arises? 

Maybe its because so much of my power was taken away from me by my ex that I subconsciously feel like the more hookups I'll have the better I'll feel or I'll be more empowered etc. Almost like my minds forcing itself to heal. Like my brain telling myself ""okay maybe THIS time it will be okay"" 

So many people have suggested that I should wait till I am ready because obviously I am not at this point. I should wait until I am with someone I am in a relationship with and care a lot about and feel totally comfortable with. I keep find myself saying to them, ""yeah, who knows how long that'll take?"" The thought of being abstinent makes me anxious but the thought of having sex does too. What is wrong with me?! Why do I want this so bad despite all the emotional and physical pain it brings me? Ugh. Smh.",mcrfreak78
PTSD,"I keep hearing about how abusive relationships are so hard to get out of because the man sweet-talks the woman and begs her to come back. Or at least that's how I THOUGHT it went.

I was in a year long relationship with an emotionally, mentally & physically abusive boyfriend. We threatened to dump each other all the time and the other would beg not to. In the beginning it was me dumping & him begging, but at the last part of it it was the opposite. He controlled, manipulated, and played mind games. I was wrapped around his finger & blinded by, what I thought was, love.

The night we broke up, he was super black out drunk & he decided to beat me because I was crying (that's literally the reason) 
I thought in most situations the guy would hit the girl then feel really bad afterwards and apologize only to do it again in the future; but he didn't stop. He kept punching, kicking, throwing, slapping me. He took my windpipe, looked me in the eye with a look like a demon had possessed him, and suffocated me twice. The last time I fell to the floor passed out.
He tried to leave but for some reason I still cared about him (I still cant figure out why) He said ""fine but I'm leaving in the morning"" & we both pass out.


I wake up next to him. He was laying facing away from me. I was in so much pain. My eye was throbbing and disgustingly bruised. I choked out, ""babe...are we still together?"" He leans over, looks at my eye & said ""Oh God"" He then jumped out of bed and started immediately packing his stuff. I was crying so hard asking why he was leaving, begging him not to. That I needed him (so I thought). He seemed like he was sad and he kept saying ""I have to.""  He then sits down and starts crying with me. He tells me ""he loves me and always will."" and we hug for the longest time. Tells me he will still pay his part of the rent. He then gets up, tells me he loves me, gives me one more hug and leaves me there to wallow in sadness, pain & emptiness.


The next day he told me we were just ""on a break"" and can ""try again"" when he ""gets his shit together."" After that day though he changed his mind and said we could never be together again, but could still be friends and hang out. Why was I the one begging him, when he had hurt me so bad? A week after all this, he calls me up crying saying he had gotten in the car and just drove & drove. Didn't know where or for how long but ended up like four states away. Told me he was scared and thinking about killing himself. I was stupid and still cared about him. I wired him money and we were talking like we were in love again that day. Was he manipulating me or did a part of him really become scared and looked to me for help?


The next two weeks after the incident we are talking. He seemed extremely depressed too. His father was abusive to his mother for like.. 10 years, and I guess he was upset that his father came out in him, because it seemed like he didn't want to become him. But then why did he? He used to cry about his dad so much in the first few months in our relationship. He was so sensitive and remorseful for being mean to me. Grieving for his lost childhood his father robbed him of. Then the last couple months between us, something in him snapped. He was so, angry at me. All the time. No matter how good I tried to be to him. He wasn't the guy I fell in love with, he had become a monster and I'm not sure why or what happened. Im not saying I was the perfect girlfriend, I have made a few mistakes, but I didn't treat him like he treated me. I put way more energy, time, and feelings into this guy than anyone ever has, despite how he acted towards me.


No matter how much I think about it I can't figure out what happened in his head. Did he care about me and just let his demons take over or did he never care & just use me for his own personal gain? When he was beating me he told me he ""stopped loving me a long time ago."" & truth comes out when you are drunk. But if he did, why did he keep coming back when I begged him not to dump me? I mean, he did do a few things for me..He called the ambulance for me when I drank to much, projecting vomit, and spent the night waiting at the hospital for me. He bought me some gifts when I caught him doing something and took me out to eat. Just all the negatives outweighed the positives. But did he care about me or not? Why did he cry and act depressed when we broke up? Only to start treating me like less than dirt again? 


I think he was either bipolar, borderline personality or something along those lines. My therapist says that they are addicted to power and control & leaving is maybe a way they still have control on you because you are begging for them back. But when they leave they wont be able to have power over me anymore to satisfy their hunger. I can don't understand all this. 


Can anyone shed some light on the situation? I am having trouble swallowing the fact that I wasn't even strong enough to leave him. I was BEGGING for my ABUSER to come back to ME. 
WHY?????????
He took that satisfaction away. It was insult to injury, a slap in the face. (Literally) I just *can't* understand why. He was so cruel, but acted remorseful and ran away.


(P.s. I am in the process of pressing charges in case you are wondering. & I am so better off without him. Hes in jail and dead to me. I will never want to have contact with him again.)


Any knowledge on this subject is appreciated. Xoxo.


TLDR: What possible reason could possess my abusive boyfriend to leave ME after he beat & almost killed me? Why was I begging for him back and not the other way around?

EDIT: Might I add he had very large sad eyes when I glared at him in court while I gave my testimony. He looked scared and hurt. I was expecting him to look angry but it was mostly of disappointment it seemed. My mom tells me he probably is remorseful, but I have a hard time agreeing. She also mentioned that he probably knew his father was in him, but just couldn't suppress it any longer and is sad it came out and hurt me. Looking back on some old text messages she might be right. One read, ""It scares me when I yell at you like that because I don't want to lose control, I don't know what I'm capable of."" Showed it to my mom & she said, ""Yeah, he knew.""

Before when we still talked he did apologize a bunch of times and told me he left because ""he didn't want it to happen again"" But why do you suddenly care about me right after you beat & break me? With all the mind control, manipulating and lying hes fed me, its no surprise that I am seriously confused and don't know what to believe. With all these mixed messages and signals.",mcrfreak78
PTSD,"I signed another student's lease who said my boyfriend could stay with me on the DL. My apartment didn't know he was living with me because only my name was on the lease. They still don't know he did. We were there for a month and he had badly beaten & almost killed on January 30th. He took off that day and I haven't been able to stay in the apartment since. 

I got a PPO against him and overall feared for my safety. On February 13th I finally gained the strength to file a report against what he did. In the meantime I was showing my apartment to others and went through hell trying to find someone to take over my lease. Finally I found someone, I signed it over, paid the fee, gave them my keys etc. 

A few weeks later my apartment called me and made up some stupid shit reasons why they couldn't let him move in therefore my name was still on the lease and owed rent. I am extremely upset. I can't and won't pay $1000 a month for an apartment I was assaulted in and found someone to live there. Its not right, given I did everything in my power to be let off the hook, but they won't give me a good reason as to why they are fucking me. I can't believe that they are deciding to screw up mine & my parents credit and future. I am trying to start a business and my whole life will be over if getting evicted is on my record. Sigh. 

I did my research and apparently there is a ""victim's protection law"" in Michigan (Section 554.601b) I can be let off the hook if I have proof I am pressing charges (which I am) Unfortunately, the incident happened almost 3 months ago and his name wasn't on the lease, he lived there against the rules. They don't know that though. I am just worried about time. I would have done it sooner if I had known, I was just trying to do the right thing and find a sub-letter. Is there anything I can do? Please help, I don't know what to do. I can't afford rent and its not fair. Thanks :/

PTSD,"I've been on adderall for either 2 or 3 years. Going back and forth between IR & XR increasing it only once from 20 to 30 I believe. (have been on focalin, strattera, & ritalin before, only to have them barely help me)

I am probably the most ADHD you can get. I recall the past few years only taking adderall when I needed to (like for school/work & not on the weekends) These meds changed my life. They've helped me with focus, calming & quieting down, impulsivity, more clear headed, calming appetite(which helped my binge eating problem) & overall makes me happy & puts me in a good mood. I want to take adderall forever.

But, my lifestyle has changed the past 3 months. I work out, eat healthy, cut down energy drinks sodas smoking gluten drinking etc. I also have been started taking vitamins & supplements.

I am obsessed with getting healthy and have been wanting the wonderful affects of adderall every day so I had started taking it everyday maybe 2 months or so ago. But the past like maybe month, I can hardly feel ANY effects anymore. My appetite is back and my motivation is gone. My grades are suffering & I have trouble going to class & getting anything done at work. I try to focus to do hw or study but it feels impossible and it's frustrating & distressing as fuck. I am getting more hyperactive & crazy obnoxious again too, which doesn't help w friends or social life.

I don't do this anymore but when I started feeling them not affecting me I would pop 2 pills so 60mg a day, diet pills, & pound energy drinks to chase the same affects but didn't feel much different. I have popped an adderall & taken a nap right after several times. Tried snorting it but that doesn't affect me at all, less than orally. 

So I went to the doctor told her everything & I asked for something stronger but she kinda just blew me off n said nah & just gave me 10mgs to take 3 hours after my first dose but I feel no different. I asked for dexatrine or desoxyn n she's like hell no I don't prescribe those. but I feel like I need help!! My education is on the line!! 

It's upsetting & frustrating having people tell me ""just sit down & do it put effort into it"" don't they understand that ADHD is a learning disorder & can  handycap people. Don't you think I haven't been putting extreme effort into focussing only to be defeated by just racing thoughts? if the solution was that simple I wouldn't have a problem. It's time go away to college but I can't like this. 

What do you think? Has this happened to anyone? Why did this happen to me? Is it because I don't take breaks anymore? What about  Should I go to another doctor n ask for dexatrine or desoxyn? How long should I take a break? Will my tolerance lower if I do? Please help!! thank you!

PTSD,Im a 19 y.o female & I just found out I have PTSD from a long emotionally and physically abusive relationship. I keep having flashbacks and nightmares of him beating me & strangling me though the overall experience is blotchy & hard to remember. he never sexually assaulted or raped me though. we had pretty good sex. but since the break up (about two months ago) I've had rebounds with three different guys and it's just been mostly painful or mediocre at best. once mediocre time I was still uncomfortable & not very enjoyable just sorta waiting for it to be done. the other times we had to stop a few minutes in cause it was dry and painful and just overall felt forced. I love sex and miss the intimacy I had with my ex despite him being a piece of shit. I can't get comfortable with anyone and can't open up. I get stressed when I think about it. Ive gotten shy and just havent been able to enjoy it :( will this go away in time? thanks !,mcrfreak78

PTSD,"I just want other girls & woman out there to know that.. they are too worthy to not allow themselves to be treated less than they deserve. nobody should settle for anyone that fronts like they love you & will change for you, just telling you what you wanna hear EVERY TIME but then turns around & chooses to hurt you again OVER & OVER knowing that they can. being with someone who brings you down, belittles, uses, manipulates, lies, plays power trips & mind games etc. is NOT okay. I wish more females wouldn't be in denial & so blinded by love by someone who makes your life miserable. He may have not put a hand on you yet but honey if the red flags are there DO NOT ignore em. Things WILL gradually get worse & worse. The warning signs are there & every time you forgive him for crossing the line it just shows that it is okay to treat you that way. He may tell you he will change & things will be different but do the actions back up the talk? Nobody deserves that many chances. So many girls don't think they are worthy enough to be respected or just aren't secure enough to know that being alone is better than being with someone who makes you cry more than you laugh. You may love them but its best to just cut your losses before it's to late. You deserve better & just know that there is ALWAYS somebody in your life to provide you the strength & support you need. You are stronger than you thought.



EDIT: I just wanted to bring up the point of controlling significant others. Do NOT allow yourself to be the victim of someone who doesn't have anything better to do but just play power trips & mind games. For example, my ex used to purposely make me cry. He would hurt my feelings, I would bawl my eyes out begging him to cuddle & comfort me and he got some sick pleasure out of ignoring me & pushing me away. Kinda strikes a nerve to talk about because it used to kill me to see him sad and cry, & I would have never ignore someones pleas to be loved, especially from someone who is suppose to love you more than they love themselves. It takes a very sick and low  person with no self-worth to feel like they have to make other people who love them unhappy in order to make themselves feel better. Your significant other should work WITH you not AGAINST you. You should be two halves of a whole. A team. BOTH putting in 100%. NO relationship will last when ONE person is putting in most/all the effort to make things work. He would blow me off when I would try to talk about our problems and get angry. I should have realized then that whats the point in being with someone when you cant talk about ANYTHING. When EVERYTHING you say gets the person to snap at you. I used to just make excuses for him because he was bipolar, but being treated bad's not okay. They should be HAPPY to be with you because you are SPECIAL. They should WANT to make you happy and should hurt when you hurt. Just DON'T allow yourself to be fucked with by someone who just doesn't seem to care as much as you do. Power trips are a disgusting way weak people try to make themselves feel better & bring down strong people, like you. They know deep down they are a piece of shit. No relationship is worth all that pain, energy, & effort. Especially when it is ALL coming from your end.",mcrfreak78

I had a great experience, the guy was extremely nice & made the whole process fast and easy. I looked into college id mart but saw some bad reviews. one girl who posted the review gave me this guys info then posted a review bout her new ids. Naturally I did alot of research to find something legit & make sure I wouldn't get scammed. Im so glad my search is over. he makes your id before you pay.. took him about 12 hours from when I ordered to send me a pic of it, then shipped em overnight to me. He gives you two for the price of one and gave me a discount. Its great comfort knowing if something happens to one you have a backup. I accidently sent college id mart my info n told em sorry it was a mistake don't post my info, & he told me ""you have till Friday"" then started cussing and basically threatening me. fuck that noise I don't want to give my business to a blackmailing asshole. My IDs bend a little but if u bend em to much the lamination pops up but I went barhopping and to the liquor store on NYE & haven't got denied yet. haven't had it scanned yet but I heard they do so I guess we'll see. also I showed it to my boss who was a bouncer for 30 years n first thing he said was ""that's a great fake."" hope I helped & feel free to ask questions (:",mcrfreak78

PTSD,"I just need to vent my fury 





So I lost my regular insurance turning 26 and had no choice but accept Medicaid assistance. I show up to this ""doctors"" office which is really some 4 room cramped shack, the doctor apparently has multiple offices and is never at this one, but his wife runs this one- oh no she's not a doctor or anything, just boses the nurse practitioner and patients around as per her husbands wishes. 







But the coup de gras of it all, the wife decided she need to question how much care I required and said those fucking words, 





""you're 27 you shouldn't have these problems “






Well no fucking shit sherlock how wonderful would it be if none of us ever has to live a life of daily pains, sickness, and trouble. I snapped back of course, and then had a full anxiety attack as it sunk in that I was now in the care of people who won't give a shit because Medicaid is the McDonald's of medical care and compassion.

PTSD,"I recently had a dream I used my abilities on in small increments to guide its path. I did allow it to curve a bit out of line because I use movies/TV programs to influence themes. The program on dominated the dream at one crucial point that shattered it and I woke up.



Its strange I can't seem to forget this dream in all its details and crave returning to it nightly...



How about you lucid dreamers? Do any have the ones that got away? Or maybe master that can recapture? Its an interesting subject.",insurgi

PTSD,"What do you think ? Do you think it's necessary for us to call it a disorder ? Can we just call it post traumatic stress ? I want to be clear that it should be acknowledged that it does hurt, it does cause us exquisite pain and it does impair our functioning. We are in a state where we are under a lot of stress so the ""stress"" part should be kept. My issue is where is the stress coming from, is it society which allows various traumas and which should be doing more to prevent them or should the cause be attributed to sufferer's biology/genetics ?

People who are grieving a death seem to get some sympathy from society, and things like bereavement leave and other special allowances even though their grief is not considered a disorder. People expect them to be under a lot of stress, accept that they won't be functioning at their normal level (or even at all) and not themselves and people expect them to take a while to recover, however the stress they are under is generally considered normal and a normal reaction. ",traumasucks
PTSD,"Does anyone else get this ? People/friends/acquaintances/family members assuming that they would have had more strength or would have acted differently when surviving our trauma ? In extreme situations they may judge us as lazy or spoilt (ouch!).

It hurts having to deal with this perspective in people. And the denial of our strength/courage takes a toll on me. It feels like struggling hard to swim against the tide and then having someone stand there meanwhile you are struggling, discouragingly telling you that it's not really that hard as you say it is. I don't think that most people mean to do it consciously.

I'm beginning to consider that I may need to limit contact with these sorts of people for my own mental health. The subtle disrespect is very draining. And quite frankly I think these people are seriously out of touch with reality, a little out of their minds and their craziness is contagious. I need to acknowledge my strength, courage and hard work in order to keep working hard. If I let myself feel that I'm not working hard and stop acknowledging and being proud of my hard work, I'm not going to be motivated to keep working hard, being courageous and showing strength.

On the other hand there are some people who it feels like do acknowledge our strength. I usually come away from interacting with those people feeling encouraged to work extra hard on improving my life. My emotions, insecurities about trusting or any flashbacks calm down and I feel relaxed and at peace around them.

PTSD,"I was thinking today that in spite of the relationship difficulties inherent in PTSD, not only is it difficult for us but also people are missing out on having us in friendships and other partnerships and relationships with them. They missing having our amazing qualities and kindness and wonderful natures. We would be wonderful people to get to know. It is a great loss to these people.",traumasucks
PTSD,"In the last few days I have tried to reconnect with a couple of friends/people who I thought I may have misjudged. With one of them I just wanted to say, ""Listen I went through a trauma, this is what happened to me and I want you to know that I was on edge with you the other day. I don't actually dislike you. I got triggered by what you said but I don't think you meant to hurt me or are a bad person and I want you to know I don't dislike you."" Instead she basically ended up defending why she should be able to say certain things to me. My intention in starting our conversation (maybe I was thinking wishfully) was to connect with her. That was disappointing to me how it ended up turning out. I felt discouraged and I still feel discouraged thinking about it. Maybe I was surprised because I thought that when she saw how much pain I was in she would end up changing her viewpoint or feel more empathy. I was and am deeply disappointed.

Unfortunately I was disappointed again this morning. I was attempting to somewhat repair a relationship with a former classmate of mine. I felt like I may have made her feel ashamed because sometimes I'm not very accurate at communicating my viewpoint. I told her, ""Listen I'm sorry I think I hurt you. I think I miscommunicated,  I did not mean it to come across this way. I meant this instead."" Then she told me that I have an absurd viewpoint and was disrespectful towards me. I was deeply disappointed again. Why do I even try ? I am disappointed. It seems like people are an endless disappointment. Honestly is it any wonder some of us shut down and stop trying to connect with people ? It's like we just give up. The heartbreak and trauma of trying and holding out hope with someone and trying for connection and then finding them unwilling to connect is heartrending. And it's sadly like another trauma to keep sustaining. I am disheartened. I know that there are some amazing people out there but finding those people is hard. 

This is particularly disheartening to me because (as far as I can see) I know that I did things ""right"" in chatting with these people. I was calm. I apologized and expressed sorrow for the parts that I felt I got wrong and for hurting their feelings. I was concerned about their feelings and yet it seems that that made absolutely no difference to them.  If I had been having a flashback with them and I don't communicate in a calm and sensitive way I can see how they could not see it. ",traumasucks
PTSD,"Relationships just don't feel right. Literally I've tried to date so many people of different kinds and no matter what I just can't seem to do it or if I do we only stay together a short time. I know that a lot of this is due to the trauma that happened to me. 

I don't want to ignore my gut sense or say that my gut sense is wrong. I don't want to say that my feelings are wrong. I don't want to blame myself for not having ""normal"" feelings like other people. I know that my feelings are normal given what has happened to me. I'm also not sure whether I should try out a relationship anyway. I mean I know that I can behave differently than my feelings say without saying that my feelings are wrong. Also I know that my gut sense has a purpose, to protect me so I have my reservations about going against my feelings. I don't fault myself or other abuse survivors for being confused about our feelings either and not having a clear reading of our gut sense.

I also know that I avoid relationships when I'm hurt and when having a fair relationship seems a far off dream. Connecting with other people is not my strong suit and when I feel that I'm feeling down and not in a position to enforce strong boundaries with someone, at that moment I'm hurting and I really don't feel like being close to someone. People seem particularly unappealing at that moment. Nevertheless I appreciate closeness with kind and fair people. ",traumasucks
PTSD,"Every time I try to date someone I find myself feeling humiliated. I have this sense that they were never betrayed by family the way that I was and if I mention it they are not going to understand me or be on my side. I don't think people are generally going to be outright mean to me about it but I think that people are going to subtle discount my experience in a similar way that people discount race, ""Oh well racism can't be THAT bad."" I've been wounded (and frankly humiliated) numerous times when people say to me, ""But you parents still love you"" and that discounting makes me (literally) sick. It takes a tremendous toll on my mental health. I just do not want to feel that humiliation in a relationship and frankly I feel that there would be few people who would be able to understand my experience who haven't been through the same with their parents or aren't actively trying to combat the child abuse problem. If they are actively trying to combat the child abuse problem then I would feel different about them and safer.  ",traumasucks

PTSD,"The hardest thing about having PTSD is having people lose respect for you. They subconsciously think that in your situation they would be stronger. That discourages me immensely. I want to say to them, ""I'm trying my best here! I was about to let go a long time ago but I tied a knot in my rope and hung on.""
I also feel like by having lost respect for me, my trust in them is something that can never be reclaimed. Even if I were to get better and they suddenly started respecting me again, I still wouldn't be able to ever trust them the same way again. I feel like I'm living with the knowledge of some people's shallowness that I almost wish I didn't have to know. But then again I guess that it is OK that I know.",traumasucks

Thanks!",kelderboiler
PTSD,"The struggle is real, sca. 

My skin has been dehydrated for ages, no matter what I do. Now, I've finally managed to give up smoking and am as gentle to my skin as humanly possible. Cold weather always messes up my skin to no end, I get windburned super easy and general dehydration all around. To prepare for winter I picked up some Weleda Cold Cream to try. 

It's not actually a cold cream as in a cleansing cream, it's just a very heavy moisturizer for dry/cracked skin. It smells amazing, but the essential oils responsible for that scent are irritating my skin. 

Right now, I'm sitting here sulking with scaly red cheecks covered in vaseline, which I've had to reapply about four times today to keep away the itching and tightness.

What the hell do I do about this drought? Oils never seem to agree with me and most moisturizers I've tried break me out. It seems the skin barrier just doesn't repair itself no matter what I do and keeps causing all kinds of trouble. Thanks in advance! 

Routine:  
- AM: splash with water/shower, Weleda cold cream (which I'm replacing with Nivea and/or Vaseline until I get a permanent fix)

PTSD,"After introducing slowly, this has been a part of my daily routine for two weeks now and I'm very impressed. My skin hasn't been this clear-yet-hydrated in AGES. 

I'm extremely dehydration prone and I had just about given up on skincare when I found this sub. I was just using water and a cheap daycream at this point. First tried ocm with mineral oil, which wasn't for me, then switched out to vaseline as a moisturizer on damp skin. This already made a huge difference.

Since I was still not cleansing properly and still a bit clogged, I just walked into Kiehl's and told them I needed the gentlest cleanser they have. She gave me this and told me as it was sulfate-free, it should work fine. Since I'm very sensitive to sulfates (flakes ahoy) I bought it on the spot.

It just combines all the good things about ocm with the ease of use of a foaming cleanser. It's a bit expensive, but since it's the only thing I splurge on for skincare I figured it would be worth it. Let me tell you, *it is*.

CURRENT ROUTINE

PTSD,"After noticing it became more and more difficult and distressing to help me, we made this together. This is highly personal of course, but I figured it might be useful for anyone who struggles to help their loved ones help them. It's mostly based on what we read online about ptsd in general and ways to self-help. I know it seems like a lot to ask, especially when it comes to anger or irritability, but my end of the deal is to try and control my anger as much as possible and recognize symptoms and ask for help as soon as possible, before it could get out of hand. The sooner I can recognize anxiety, the easier it is to talk me down and the lower the chances of lashing out.

WHAT TO DO DURING A PANIC ATTACK:

1. Come and sit next to me - move slowly, do not touch unless asked.

2. Help ground me in the present: 

- what are you feeling? (back against chair, hands on table, feet on ground)

- breathe together, slowly, count if necessary: in 3 seconds, hold 3 seconds, out 3 seconds

- recognize sights together (e.g. the cat is sitting over there, tell me what he's doing)

    => if not calming down at this point, repeat from step 2

- recognize smells (food, coffee/tea, soap... anything goes here)

- recognize sounds

3. cheer me up: tell me a story, make a cup of tea, hug if appropriate etc.

THINGS TO REMEMBER:

- Remain calm, or pretend you are during an attack. (anger, real or perceived, is a trigger for me)
- Do not leave me alone suddenly or touch me without a warning.
- Irritability can be the onset of panic. Ask what you can do to help at this point.

PTSD,"Hello fellow slugs and non-slugs alike! Recently, I've been looking into some chemical exfoliants that are available where I live. The only one I've found under EU20 are Clearasil pads, which contain 2% salicylic acid. In the past I've used a spot treatment with the same concentration, which worked, but gave me red blotches almost every time so I'm very reluctant to use the pads.

So I've been looking at the more expensive Kiehls, and they have a vitamin c serum with 10.5% vitamin c, glycerin and propyleen glycol. Their ""Over-Night Biological Peel"" containx Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid (what a name) and ureum.

I have no experience with ureum but I know glycerin works well on my extremely dehydration-prone skin, so I'm more inclined to try the Vit C serum. However, it's the more expensive option. I'm also wondering if my skin would react to these acidic ingredients since it does so badly to the salicylic acid. Does anyone have any advice or experience with these product? Thanks very much in advance!",kelderboiler
PTSD,"I've been using vaseline on my face for about four days now, on damp skin after cleansing, morning and evening, and then patting off excess. Also OCM with mineral oil every two or three days - I've used this oil before locally and never had any noticeable issues. The rest of my routine is the same as before. 

I have to say - mostly, my face feels great. It feels a lot more comfortable and hydrated and looks smoother. However, where skin is thinnest, i.e. right under my eyes, I've got some roughness and redness. It feels a bit like windburn. All over, there's some slight itching as well. I didn't attribute this to the change in routine because it seems so paradoxical, but it seems it's getting worse. Could this be a sensitivity to minerail oil? Has someone had a similar experience?

I've known her for a long time now but she's always tending towards comparing herself to others or showing her success off for recognition. I'm a generally very nice person, so I'll say congrats, good job, etc. She got an internship through family connections and I even congratulated her on that. But when I achieve something, nothing comes from her. I don't think it's jealousy, I think she just genuinely believes she's better than me. Also, since I'm on a term off for therapy etc, she said to me that she 'misses time off and time to do just nothing', though she understands what I'm going through and constant panic attacks and nightmares aren't exactly 'time off'. Today I posted a status about Maya Angelou because she's inspired me and a quote to go with it, and she commented a different quote beneath it. Just a bit unnecessary in my opinion. When I posted a status about a good mark, she'd say 'I got this or I got that'.

Even something like a healing home, with a cosy interior and welcoming, supportive vibes (free tea and biscuits!) would fit into my plan. I want to organise events, potentially hosting an inspiring guest speaker. Or simply a group discussion, where the attendees can talk freely and feel supported in doing so. I want to potentially organise some counselling. I want to host writing or art workshops to spark their creativity, or cooking classes or career events. I want to organise fun barbecues and lunches. These events would be charged at affordable prices to cover the cost of staff and venue, equipment etc. I could organise small volunteering projects in the area where the community could attend and help out, to feel productive and good about themselves. Moreover, I would be selling merchandise of which the proceeds would go back into funding projects etc. Essentially, I want to make them feel special and loved because they are. YOU are.

This is a very rough idea and since the people in this subreddit - yes, you - would be the one benefitting from this enterprise, any and all feedback/advice proves invaluable. Market research, if you will.

I identify as Hispanic and as a Latina; my father is Mexican and my mother is British (immigrated at 16; Irish/Welsh). I don't have much experience with my Hispanic culture, but I am proud of the traditions I know and was taught growing up. Some of them should be scrutinized, but overall, I think most traditions have their place and context. Most of my Hispanic heritage comes from Mexico and northern New Mexico. All that is just for some context.

My friend is white and starts talking about not having had a sweet sixteen. She then looks to me and says:
""Hey, I'm just going to throw myself a Quincenera; want to come?"" 
I was a little taken aback, but just scoffed and asked her if she knew what that was. She replied ""a Mexican sweet sixteen right?"" 
I don't know what it was, but that flippant attitude pissed me off and made me feel a little weird (ashamed/ridiculed maybe?) about my Latina identity. It just felt like privilege; it's ok for her to throw a Quincenera at 25 like a sweet sixteen playing whatever music she wants, inviting whomever friends, and generally making a mockery of a familial tradition. It's ok because it's ""cute"" when she would do it. Had I had a Quincenera myself, it would have been lots of family, religious iconography, a celebration of a sexist, albeit less so today, tradition. It would also been extremely inappropriate for me to have one at this age. Yet, she felt like this was somehow not offensive.

It took me about a week to be able to even keep up the hoop, but it was something I looked forward to. It was a small challenge that I knew I could do. If trying to waist hoop got too frustrating, I'd switch to letting it twirl around my hands and try to control it a little.

I have lost over 100 pounds over the last 14 months, and the first time I found this sub, I started buying bras at Dillard's. They worked pretty good for a while, but I quickly noticed problems, so maybe I could get some reccomendations to try in some newer sizes?

* Freya Deco T-shirt bra 34 G worked great for a little while; the wires were too narrrow and the band seemed too thin and not supportive enough. The gore tacks, is a little squishy, aka I can push it against where my breasts bleed into each other and get boob popping out the top. I got some quad boob, more so now, but the cups seem not projected enough at the bottom (the band beneath the cups ride down in front and pinches). Now the band is just big and the cups are doing this whole too small at the bottom too big at the top thing.

* Fantasie Salsa 32 H (UK?) was ugly, but comfy. The top of the cups cut in at the my breast tissue and it didn't seem to really give me any lift. I just felt like I was being held there. The gore used to tack, but now it kind of leans to my smaller side. There seemed to be too much projection at the nipple in this bra, which would get baggy, and the wires were almost wide enough, but still not there. Plus, the straps fall down all the time, even when tightened to the max.
 
* Cabernet full-busted bra 34 H (US). Surprsingly, these seemed to fit the best, but I think it's because I don't know what a good fitting bra looks or feels like yet. The gore lays against my sternum, but again, when I press on it, there's a lot of squishyness and I get some quad(sexta?)boob, band riding, and other tell-tall sighs of too small band, too big cup. But, the style provides great lift and shape for me.

* Le Mystere Dream Tisha balconette 34 H Fr. This bra I got suckered into buying before I knew about the difference between French, European, and UK sizing. Major quadboob, no gore tacking, digging straps, and too narrow wires.

* Natori convertable sports bra 34 H, because the 32 was the first bra that I had ever tried that actually was difficult to get around me. Plus, for the sale price, I can live with a little bit of quadboob/boob pain from the wires for the sake of containment and great support. While I got this bra, for what it's worth, I also tried a Freya active sport (?) in a 32G(GG?) and it gave me that upside down 7 shape that I've heard of. Maybe this can help with suggestions too?

Standing Bust: 42 inches
Bent Over Bust: 45 inches
Laying Bust: 43 inches

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/92AT0) is an album NSFW, boobs in bra, of me in a Fantasie Salsa and Freya Deco (the deco is beige, the salsa is sheer grey).

I think I may be shallow, full on bottom, with a very wide AND tall root, and I also have several cup sizes worth of breast tissue beneath my arms. You can see more unmigrated tissue on my back. I used to be fitted into B and C cups for all my life, until I came here and realized that the tissue under my arms wasn't just some kind of deformity like I thought it was, that was boob!

Anyway, the band doesn't seem to ride up in the Fantasie, but it still feels pretty loose. I may have some bias about tightness though, because I am no stranger to corseting and have been told I ""compress"" pretty easily. That being said, the prospect of going to a 30, or even 28, band doesn't scare me, but I don't know how that would affect how my tissue is encapsulated.
The gore on both these bras tack, by the way, even with all the quadboobing on the Freya. What's up with that?

The cups on both these bras have some obvious problems though. On the Fantasie, my breasts finally have a wide enough wire to actually lay inside of the cup, but I get the orange in a glass effect, and the tops of the cups cut into my upper breast tissue. On the Freya, the cups wrinkle at the bottom and sometimes gape at the top.
Another note the underwires: in the Freya, they really don't feel wide enough, and I feel lke my breasts may actually be pushing them wider, hence the bagginess at the bottom of the cup? On the Salsa, I've read reviews that the wires were insanely wide, but they happen to be just the right width. What other bras are out there like this? I saw from some of the resources here that Curvy Kate is probably my best bet. Which Curvy Kate, or similar bra, should I try out?

I really, really love the shape my Freya gives, and I feel kind of unattractive in the Salsa, like my breasts are way too low on my body. I would really love a balconette, to be honest, but I wanted to start with whatever Dillard's had to offer and then get more specified directions, hopefully, after posting here.

And finally, my psn plus subscription is going to expire next month and I'm negotiating with /u/sebs123 some gift cards to subscribe again, suck my balls paypal.

Selective syncing let you choose what songs will be downloaded in different devices (you can download something to your iPhone, but not to your iPad, for example). I found a way to make that for the whole music collection, unfortenelly, the device must be jailbroken.

Steps:
1- Kill rdio in the task launcher
2- Launch iFile app (avaliable on Cydia)
3- Navigate to '/mobile/applications/rdio/Documents/S10375864/audio'
4- Select all files minus 'storage-version' and delete them
5- Go back to the S10375864 folder and click in more info for the audio folder
6- Set the file attributes to read and execute only (unmark the write option)
7- Close iFile, launch rdio and let it sync again

Now you will have access to all your collection, Rdio will sync normally your new songs and playlists, but it won't be able to download the music to your offline collection. It will only work with a data connection and you won't waste storage space with songs that you want to have on one device, but not on the other.

PTSD,"As a missionary kid in boarding school, I was sexually abused and tortured with electric shocks from about 5 to 10 years old.  I became dissociative and unable to interact socially.  I was especially terrified of religious people and religious icons and imagery since it was associated with the abuse.   I couldn't enter a church without anxiety and intense emotional responses (anger, fear, sadness all mixed together).  

Later in life I continued to have flashbacks and night terrors that I did not even fully understand.  I constantly lost time and dissociation became a frequent ""hideout"" for me, even when I was no longer being abused.  While abused, I think it helped me survive but later, it was completely dysfunctional.  For a time I was terrified of being outside because I felt I needed a roof to make sure I did not float away up into the sky, because there were times I thought I did just that.  It was such a powerful sensation that even today I can tell you what it ""felt"" like to float high up in the sky - it is isolated, cold and wet, people and the ground seem a very distant thing.  I struggled to ""anchor"" myself and really thought I could float away from my body.  I also clearly remember frequently ""floating"" up to the ceiling in school and struggling to ""get back down into my body"".  Of course I know now I did not actually leave my body but it really and truly felt like I did.  My brother described me as looking like I was ""empty"".  I am pretty sure he must have been describing what I looked like when I ""floated away"".

I am now 53, but to this day I still struggle with anxiety and tend to see danger where none exists.  I have mostly learned to live with my faults but sometimes it still knocks me down a dark hole.  

I was never treated until well into my forties and never heard of PTSD until then either.  I was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder (I like to think I have mostly resolved that now) and CPTSD.  It will always be with me, I learn to live with it.  I cannot ""leave it behind"" or pretend it never happened.  I can't do that any more than a paraplegic can pretend to not be a paraplegic.  I can adapt and live with it, which is what I do my best to do.

So this latest puzzles me.  I don't ask to challenge or offend, only to understand.  

I always thought sexual people needed to feel attraction to want to have sex.  People always talk about physical appearance and how it is so very important for them to want to have sex- they don't want sex with what they perceive as an unattractive person because they need to feel attraction.  

So, what is up with this insistence that they do not need to be attracted to want to have sex?  Does that apply to unattractive people too?   If a straight man will have sex with men, and does not need to be attracted, does that mean that the appearance of the man does not matter?",flyonawall

PTSD,"The claim was made that ""Jesus supports humanism"", implying that only the Old testament is a problem for humanistic Christians and that only the Old Testament is a source of ""conflicts"".  This is not at all true.  I know this struggle first hand since, as a kid, I listened many times to Wycliffe Bible translators try to translate the Bible.  I was a missionary kid and had to memorize a lot of the Bible.  I know what it says.  There are a few kind parts in both the Old and the New Testament, but ultimately, the Bible is not a humanistic document, not even the New Testament.  It is first and foremost about placing ""god"" above all else.  Christians will always have a problem until they throw out the Bible.

Missionary translators face quite the quandary.  Many consider themselves humanistic (and many really are) but then they discover how non-humanistic the Bible is, even the New Testament.  How do you make the Bible match the message you think you bring?  How to translate the Bible when you want to preach love and support?  First you toss out the Old testament entirely as that is a lost cause with regard to their intended message (it is only for ""mature"" Christians).  But the New Testament is not so easy either.   When translating it, they were forced to either skip entire sections or change what it said to make it sound better - so it would fit the message they thought they wanted.  The bottom line was, not even the New Testament could be translated without having to deal with the violence and anti-humanistic statements.  

Some people, who were fundamentally humanistic (in spite of Christian teachings), tried to explain it away and change what it said.  Others took it literally and insisted on translating exactly what was there.  It gave rise to a lot of conflict and I listened to many an argument (I was just a kid listening to the adults at the time and did not enter the discussion).  They often turned to other supposed ""source"" literature and that generally did not help.  It still came down to people who were humanisitic (regardless of what the Bible said) and those who placed the sanctity of the Bible ahead of humanism and wanted to keep it ""true"".  

In the end, the only conclusion you could really draw was that the Bible, both New and Old Testament are full of violence and hatred toward humanity and ultimately focused on placing ""God"" above all.  This is an undeniable conflict with humanism and is a source of anti-humanistic behavior.  Either ""God"" is first or humans are.  The only way out of this conflict is to decide that what ever ""God"" demands is best for humanity, even if that means violence.

Christians can be good people and they can be humanistic but they ultimately have to ignore many Biblical teachings to do so and they have to place people before their god, which again, conflicts with their religion.

In Mathew, Jesus condemns entire cities to death and eternal torment in ""hell"" because they didn't care for his preaching. (11:20-24)

Even if he can't actually do that, it is not exactly humanistic in spirit...

She just needs to be there looking pretty, sparkling and smiling with you, no matter what.  Yes, it is silly, but for me, she was serious comfort.

I loved my Barbies as a kid, and collect them now, but for me they were even more important that just a toy.  I was placed in boarding school at a very young age (5-10 years old) where I was abused about every way possible but my dolls were an important part that helped me survive it.  It sounds idiotic, but I really don't think I would have made it without them.  They were my escape world and comfort and companions, especially my Barbie and my Skipper.  I was devastated when they were all left behind when I finally got free of that place.  It was a good thing I got away but it was awful to leave them behind.  To my little girl mind, I was abandoning them to the most awful fate.  I think maybe that was part of why doll collecting now is still therapy for me and I was driven for a time to recover my lost dolls.  I used to feel ashamed and embarrassed at my attachment to those lost dolls, but one of the nicest things about getting old is not caring what other people think and feeling free to enjoy those childish things.

What if I pushed farther, calling for the jailing of religious people?  Would it still be acceptable to call it an ""atheist movement""?

Can any movement that includes the idea of lack of belief in a god or gods be called an ""atheist movement""?

No? Where do you draw the line?

I had to sit through a perfectly benign training today that nearly knocked me out.

PTSD,"There is an interesting post/discussion going on about some woman who refuses to have sex with her husband. She sounds like a self-centered bitch but I can understand some of the things she says - she just is completely oblivious to the feelings of anyone other than herself.  She does not get why sex is so interesting to others, I can understand that, but she fails to recognize that others clearly feel differently.

>http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/30nuri/to_the_low_libido_lady_who_hates_having_sex_with/

What I found interesting was that among the comments there are several from men who describe being in a similar situation.  A surprising number in fact.  They find themselves with wives who do not want to have sex at all or very little.  It sounds like the wives played along (had sex as expected) but eventually reverted to their true low sex drive state.  It is hard to keep up pretending to like sex.  Eventually that fails.  Maybe in some or most cases it is due to some medical condition, but maybe not.  

In contrast to this, I previously happened on a comment thread about **men** struggling with wives who wanted sex more than they did- they were the ones who felt pressured into sex.  They felt mistreated by wives who demanded sex and expected them to perform.

It made me wonder, maybe having little or no sex drive is actually more common that we think.  We grow up assuming we are supposed to be sexual, we try to be sexual, play along and get married, and then are stuck having to keep up the facade of wanting sex.  If true, this is brutally unfair to both the husband and wife.   Both sexes would suffer if paired up with someone who's sexual drive does not match theirs.  

Given that sex is so intensely important to those who want it, the priority of people should maybe be finding a partner who has a matching sex drive, even more than one who initially attracts them (more than physical appearance).   Being physically attracted to someone does not indicate a matching sex drive.  Especially when nearly everyone is raised to think they must act ""sexy"", regardless of their interest in sex.  People solely focus on a particular ""look"" they like.  Too bad.  It seems like there are a lot of miserable couples with mismatched sex drives.  

I wonder if it would help if society would accept that some people do not have much desire for sex and if it were OK to admit that.  Too bad it is not socially acceptable to not be ""sexy"" and not act ""sexy"".  To bad people are not encouraged to portray what they really want in a relationship.  If they could, then people could more easily find a sexual partner with a matching sex drive.  Right now, everyone has to be ""sexy"" to be socially acceptable and popular so everyone tries to portray a ""sexy"" image, regardless of their desire to have sex.  ",flyonawall
PTSD,"I feel like I see people differently than most.  Sometimes it just seems like I live in a world that has gone mad with sex.  It seems like it drives people to crazy extremes and forces them to build their lives around the pursuit of it.  I used to be convinced that religion and religious fanaticism was the primary driving force behind a lot of evil in the world but sometimes what I see on reddit has made me I wonder about that.  

Maybe it is just skewed by the population that posts on reddit, but posts about ""every mans dream"" (a post of one man with two women and the comments were all about how much they wished for that), post after post about sex and the pursuit of it.  

I know most people think it is an illness to not be a slave to your sex drive (to lack a sex drive), but that seems ridiculous to me when you see the extremes that people go to to satisfy their drive.   From my perspective it looks like an illness to be a slave to it.  It drives people to insane lengths to satisfy it and it dominates nearly everything they do.   It is hard to imagine why you would want that.  Maybe that is just reddit.  I don't really know.  

I look at people at work sometimes and I wonder if they too are driven like that.  Maybe that is why some men feel the need to ask women to cover up (like hijabs) - they really cannot control their thoughts or physical response to a woman they perceive as sexually attractive - and the same for women who see men they are attracted to.

I do not mean to define it differently.  To be as clear as possible, I do not mean to define anyone or anything.  I do not mean to challenge anyone's definition of themselves or the meaning of the words they use.

I am not trying to ""split"" some community.  I honestly do not feel I belong to the community that calls itself ""asexual"", due to how they define it.  For me gender is irrelevant and sex drive (presence/absence) is the relevant characteristic.

Clearly we do not, and it is much more productive for them to focus on learning to live in a world designed for sighted or hearing people than to fight what they are.   In some senses they may even have advantages and better developed alternate senses that more than make up for a lack of sight or hearing.  

Similarly, sometimes a lack of a sex drive may be a temporary situation and maybe can be reversed but what if it cannot?  Is that even such a terrible thing?  Wouldn't it be better to focus on living in world designed for the sexual than spending a lifetime fighting the lack of a sex drive?  Is it really such a terrible thing to lack a sex drive?

I am 52, soon to be 53 and I have spent a lifetime trying to find that magical person, or place or event or whatever, that would make me a sexual person.  Just like sight or hearing can be lost due to injury, I supposed it is possible that I lost my sex drive due to childhood injury at a very young age.  Or maybe I was born that way.  I really do not know but that seems irrelevant now.  Whether it was destroyed at 5 years old or never existed to begin with, does not matter.  I am who I am.  Do I have to be something else?

Neither is a bad thing, nothing is wrong with either (so long as everyone involved is consenting), but they are not the same and I still do not understand why there seems to be a persistent insistence that they are fundamentally the same.  

Apparently some people get a sexual response to unexpected things (and the more I read on this the more it puzzles and astounds me) instead of responding to another person.  That seems one of the ways to define ""asexual"".

Regardless of what they are responding to, they are a sexual being still, just not stimulated by the more conventional things.

I wonder if this is due to the pervasive belief that we are all sexual beings and cannot possibly not be.  I could be wrong, but I still question that belief.  I can't imagine getting a sexual response to a man, let alone nails on chalkboard.

PTSD,"I guess I am still exploring the way the term ""asexual"" is defined.  It stills seems like most of the time it is associated with low or no sex drive (in spite of the fact that r/asexuality insists otherwise).  For example, on this page discussing how it is displayed in pop culture, the examples are all ""suspected asexual"" due to an apparent lack of sexual activity (implying a lack of a sex drive) 

http://asexuality.weebly.com/pop-culture-references.html

The implied definition of ""asexuality"" illustrated here is pretty much what I would have expected.

In another example, here too, suggests that they assume an asexual lives a life without sex.  

http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2012/life-without-sex-imagining-asexuality-popular-culture

This is how I would have expected to define asexuality.

It really surprised me to have so many people tell me asexuality had nothing to do with sex drive - I was really confounded by one who even claimed to have a sex drive ""through the roof"" but still considered himself asexual because he did not want to have sex with his girlfriend of 6 years.  What was he having sex with?  I have a hard time imagining this - so what exactly does drive his ""through the roof"" sex drive?  I assume himself.  I cannot imagine that someone who is self described to be driven to masturbate that much would be described as ""asexual"".   Self-sexual seems more appropriate.  That would be a logical description that is much more easily understood.  

AVEN describes it as:

>According to the  The Asexual Visibility and Education Network, AVEN: An asexual person is someone who does not experience sexual attraction. http://www.campuspride.org/tools/introduction-to-asexual-identities-resource-guide/

That still suggests a low or no sex drive.  How can a person with a ""sex drive through the roof"" claim to not experience sexual attraction?  Clearly they experience sexual attraction, just not to conventional men or women apparently, but to something else (such as themselves or objects).

I can't help but wonder why this all came about.  Someone mentioned that this defintion was to be more inclusive but it seems to me that they have been so ""inclusive"" as to exclude the most logical meaning.

Science:

>Asexual reproduction is a mode of reproduction by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it is reproduction which almost never involves ploidy or reduction. The offspring will be exact genetic copies of the parent, except in the specific case of automixis. https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=asexual%20reproduction

Wikipedia:

>Asexuality (or nonsexuality)[1][2][3] is the lack of sexual attraction to anyone, or low or absent interest in sexual activity.[4][5][6] It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the four variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality.[7][8][9] A study in 2004 placed the prevalence of asexuality at 1% in the British population.[7][10]

However, apparently for many people it is defined simply as:

>Asexuality means a lack of sexual attraction to any gender, and nothing else.

and is completely divorced from the concept of sex drive.  

I realized that this means that this excludes anyone who lacks a sex drive but is attracted (even if not sexually) to a gender.  I like men, I liked cuddling with my ex, so I considered myself attracted to men but I did not and do not want to have sex.

""A"" is the latin root for ""without"" so it made sense to me that ""asexual"" meant ""without sexual"".  However here it means some confusing mesh of highly sexual and possibly not sexual.  Mixing normal/highly sexual (even if only with themselves) and not sexual together as a single group is is going to inevitably lead to confusion and misunderstandings and they clearly are not going to encounter the same problems or necessarily understand each other.  I am not even clear why they would be lumped as a single group.  It seems like an awkward artificial grouping, but maybe that is just me.

I am asexual because I have always had essentially no sex drive and no interest in sex.

All service dogs take maintenance and I think this is the true therapy they provide for people fighting PTSD. It forces you to be in the moment and stop dreading everything so much.

Then I had been staying at my Mom's because I can't stand being alone (it gives me a panic attack and extreme anxiety after not too long, then I end up not sleeping and get psychotic / suicidal). Well my Mom and I had a fight and I stopped trusting her again. So I went into this full melt down, edgy mode, and felt like I had to escape. Life. Suicide. AGAIN. For the third time I felt that way this month. And I decided to go to my brother. The word that flashed in my mind as I drove 8 hours to his house. The feeling in my body: SAFETY. My brother I trust. My brother understands me. My brother believes my thoughts and feelings are real even if they don't match with reality. My brother is not a permanent solution but for now he is refuge. Just like that new relationship had been before it ripped my guts out instead. So dangerous. 

So to sum it up: PTSD for me (when I am in that psychotic, intensely anxious, can't enjoy life, feel like I am doomed, feel like I need to be somewhere else, etc state): It's like being locked in a dark room when you are a child who is afraid of the dark. You are aware it's irrational. You are old enough to realize there are no monsters. But yet you are terrified and desperately want to escape back to the safety of life. There can be other kids around you and you don't understand how they aren't paralyzed by fear. They invite you to play games because it is barely light enough to see still, but you are too terrified for that. You are crying. You are weird. They ignore you and go on playing and it really doesn't bother you because you are so scared. Your mind plays tricks on you. You see monsters in the shadows and the whispers of the wind, the creaks of the house. Your body reacts to these like they are real threats no matter how aware you are they are not. You are terrified and desperate to get out of the darkness. That's all you can do at that time. Once you are in the light, you can finally relax and figure out why you were so scared of the dark. You can expose yourself slowly to the dark so your body doesn't respond so crazy to it anymore. You can finally play night games with the other kids again.


My PTSD: The entire world is a dark locked room and I am just trying to find a light in the darkness. I keep falling down into darker holes and clamber around looking for any light. A lamp. A switch. Batteries for a flashlight that last a while but burn out. It all ends back in the same place. What I need is somewhere I will feel SAFE and UNDERSTOOD for a few months until my self esteem and confidence to take back life are back. Until I feel SAFE in my own skin and in this dark world, I cannot enjoy life and I will feel like a waste of space. My symptoms are manageable. My view on the world is still obliterated. No matter how aware of that I am, when I get psychotic, exhausted and confused, I am lost little kid in the dark who needs serious professional help or at least a caring responsible human to care in the right way for the right reason for once.

No I won't be again. Now let me draw you a pretty picture... I only started doing my art again while in the hospital for suicide. The motto is ""art that saves lives"". I don't want to be labeled victim for the rest of my life. There is more to me. But it's honestly all I am right now and I want to be an advocate against the stigma.",FunGirlJK
PTSD,"In September I had a traumatic experience where I was certain I was going to die for several days. The way I felt about life changed when I thought I was going to die. When I had to dread my certain impending death. I realized I was nothing to the universe, I was a speck of dust in a blink of time as a human. Tons of people live more horrific lives and die in more horrific ways. My family would move on because they had already shown me they really didn't care about me by letting this happen. No one would grieve but my mom and she'd die too soon anyways. Everyone else it would probably be a joke. That's how they always coped. By making me a joke. Some things don't change. I was at peace with that. That I was nothing, my life was shitty anyways and my family would at least get some pleasure out if it in a twisted way. It made me finally cope with dying. Then I survived. Realizing I was nothing gave me comfort then but fills with me with dread now. The blissful girl with unlimited potential and a dark past but a bright future died. I don't know who I am now but I look at the old YouTube videos of me and I can't remember how to be funny or be that girl. I can't remember how I felt but not like this. Like I want to but I can't and all I do is mourn her death but it's like no one knew she was alive and now no one knows she is dead. That's why I don't see a future. That's why I'm certain this can only end in one way. I don't even feel entitled to the comfort of death. I'm a shell. I'm a ghost. I've already been dead and buried for months and I was right. No one cares.",FunGirlJK
PTSD,"Nine months ago I broke up with my first serious boyfriend of four years because he was emotionally abusive. All of our closest friends were mutual and left with him. Outside of that I was pretty isolated for the last year and also moved twice, so I didn't have many close friends or family. My best friend does live 35 minutes away but she works a lot so I only see her one day a week.


I have been rapid cycling since the break up. It seems like every cycle is getting worse not better. Not just my mood but my social life and my hope. When I am manic I get excited and I go out and try really hard to make friends or find a guy to date for 2-4 weeks. Then I get discouraged by percieved rejection (I am way more insecure then I used to be) or I just wake up not interested in it anymore. None of the people I meet want to be around me or I don't want to be around them. I only talk to most people for a week or two before cutting ties (note: I actually reject most people, but that is because they tend to very immature / inexperienced).

Don't get me wrong I have made a couple of really cool friends, but they are all busy for some reason or another and I don't get to see them much or at all. It's just getting harder. I feel like I can't tell people about my bipolar issues until they have gotten to know me when I am doing well. I have my strengths and weakness, they are just a little more extreme then most peoples.


I was actually doing much better when I had my boyfriend and our friends in my day to day life. Now I work from home and only socially interact with people when I go out to find friends or hang out with someone. It's too high pressure as I don't have any casual or proffesional reasons to interact with people. Once the mania goes away I have to go home and be totally alone. I used to like to be alone while depressed but now I am depresssed more then I am normal or manic. It's hard to spend 80% of my time completely isolated. It was easy at first but I just don't think it's healthy in the long term. 


I am more desperate when I am manic, which makes me cycle through so much faster and fall so much harder when I get depressed. All of that is making people not like me or me not like people, so I am more alone. It's a vicious cycle. I barely remember what it feels like to be normal. No one sees me when I am normal and stable. Before when I was with my ex everyone loved me and wanted to be my friend, because I was more stable.


Now that I am alone I don't know how to stabilize to be normal. I am a succesful young women, pretty, in good physical shape. I love video games and have other cool interests (backpacking, MMA, etc). Everyone is impressed by my career and stuff, from a distance they love me (especially texting and what not). But when they see me up close - at least right now while I am so unstable - something always goes wrong. Which is just making everything worse and more hopeless every time.",FunGirlJK

She can't distinguish between her emotions and those of others. She thinks she feels empathy for me and can't understand that it's her own feeling of being powerless she's feeling.

PTSD,"My mom thinks the trauma was the sexual abuse, but it was not. It was the new truth I derived from my talk with mom. (I was about 7)
She told me it happens to everyone and not to worry about it. Up until I was 17-18 I thought every woman had the same experiences I had; “i'm really weak if i'm the only one who can't deal with it, they're all doing fine, I must be a complete loser for not being able to handle this fait-divers.”


The trauma is how I started to see myself, the trauma is that I had to be around people who hurt me, the trauma was not being able to talk about what confused me, not being able to ask the questions I wanted to ask and being told not to worry about it, while it worried me greatly. It wasn't given any attention. 
My feelings weren't validated and I was left alone to deal with them. My feelings weren't validated and it made me feel inadequate, not worthy to protect, “there's something wrong with me”. 

That's the trauma, and that's what she keeps repeating, “it's not the situation mazzy, it's you.” 

I have a lot of feelings that need validation but my mom tends to skip that part and go straight to the solution, the fixing, putting it all in perspective. But I don't want or need perspective, I need the first step too, the validation. 

Quit skipping steps, quit going straight for “i need to make mazzy feel better and help her manage her emotions.”

No, stop doing that. You're skipping an important step, I need validation and then I need to cry and then I need comforting and then i'll put it all in perspective. That's how I work.

Can't help it and it's pretty normal too.

I've failed at everything. I'm pretty sure i have C-PTSD. But for some reason i kept being diagnosed with Borderline. I've always rejected that label because even though my behaviour was erratic and mysterious to others, it made sense to me.

Tl;dr my mom was raped by her brothers, my dad was abandoned by his mom and sent to his grandmother when he was 2. Both my parents are traumatized and were emotionally unavailable. I tried to talk to them about my experiences and they denied it. I flipped out and threatened to kill my uncle. My parents called the cops on me. They just left.


My mom has 12 brothers and sisters. My aunts were raped by their brothers. 

My abuse started when I was about 5, I don't remember who it was. I do remember my nephews telling me I was sick and that the medicine was in their penis so I had to suck it. I told my mom about the abuse when I was about 7 and she said it happens to everyone and that I shouldn't worry about it. 


My sister was abused too and raped when she was 17 by my nephew while another nephew watched. 

There were a lot of birthdays and parties due to the big family and I never wanted to go but my mom made me. I remember saying I didn't want to go and I remember my mom saying “well what will I tell the family?” So she said I had to study. I stopped going to family functions when I was about 15 I think. 

I've always known my mom was raped. I could feel it. I recognized it. I don't think I knew before I was 12.

But when I knew, I knew. Then I started to notice who she was afraid of, so I knew which uncle it was. Or uncles. There was one I had a really strong feeling towards, one uncle I was almost sure of that he had raped my mom. 

I grew up hearing stories of my nieces; they told me they had to stop because they could get pregnant.

I remember my nephew asking me when I was 14 if we could do the things we did when we were younger.

I remember my nephew telling me he took my niece's virginity.

I remember starting to masturbate when I was 9 or younger but definitaley not older.

I remember the guilt. I remember recording myself masturbating. And the guilt. 

My 36th birthday is sunday. 

I've never been able to deal with the abuse. I tried talking to my mom and she said that she denied what happened to me because of her past.

I've asked for empathy but she keeps denying it.

So I decided to bombard her with text messages so she could feel what my life has been like.

She called the police because she thought my life was in danger.

All I wanted was recognition and empathy.

But she sent the police. 

I gave her a glimpse of what my every day life is like and she panicked. I guess that's all the confirmation I need.

I do feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders; I saw what my mom did when she felt what I felt every day. And it made her so afraid that she called the police to check on me. So somehow I know now. Somehow it became clear what I had to carry all my life and how other people respond when they have to carry the same load. I guess I feel liberated somehow. 

I'm alone, but at least i'm not in the company of people who lie and cheat and deny and argue about my experience. It's weird how it had to come this far but somehow it's fitting.

This wonderful thing happened yesterday. I invited my parents over to my new home for the first time. I asked to stop contact for a while for a reason that is a whole other story :-)

My dad is very creative, he's taken a lot of courses, from pottery to interpreter to film and photography studies. So, right now he's in his third year of 'graphic arts'. (don't know the translation but it has to do with printing and stuff) His specialty is [Silk screening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_printing) 

So a year or so ago he gave me a couple of prints just to mess around with, which i did. 

Then yesterday when he visited with my mom he saw the piece i was working on; a print of his that i was making a collage from. He told me he made a piece from a mail i wrote him (my dad and i talk a lot via email, we live very close by but this type of communication works very well for us) and i was so honoured!

PTSD,"This sub is called /r/conspiracy .

[Google search on the word conspiracy](https://www.google.be/?gws_rd=ssl#q=conspiracy) 

* First hit is a wiki for [conspiracy *theory*](https://www.google.be/?gws_rd=ssl#q=conspiracy) not *conspiracy* I find this pretty annoying. 
* Checked some [english dictionaries](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conspiracy) and some translations in my [native tongue](http://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/samenzwering) to really understand the meaning of the word. 

I think the definition of conspiracy could be; ""A secretive attempt to organize something unlawful.""

**A secretive attempt to organize something unlawful.** Let's break that down.

* Secretive: Is it really secretive when we know where they meet, who they are and what their motives are?
* Attempt: well *they* don't really attempt anything, do they, they anticipate, plan, react, seize opportunities. 
* Organize: Like any other business conglomerate they have meetings about the general direction but then everybody probably just does what serves them best.
* Unlawful: This is the most interesting one. What they're doing is not unlawful because they financially support politicians that favor their needs. Nothing unlawful is going on and if there is, some executive will be blamed. 


The longer i've been here the more i'm beginning to think there is no actual global conspiracy, they're just a bunch of incredibly **wealthy, powerful opportunists** who help each other out. But there is no global plan. There is no 'secretive attempt to organize something unlawful' because the large part of what this privileged elite does is *legal*. 

I believe in people and organizations conspiring, what I don't believe in is a global conspiracy from a select elite that **have a plan.** Not because it can't be done logistically, it can't be done because of this one factor; the people involved; 

> The scale of commodities with which they 'play' has made them so out of touch with humanity. Such sociopaths can't stick to a plan because the closer they get to the completion, the more paranoid they become. Eventually they'll turn on each other.

And I knew this because when mom sat me down to tell me you were getting a divorce I started laughing, that's how happy I was. 

I couldn't believe it. My life was going to become calm and quiet and peaceful. 

No more guessing your mood, no more jumping up from whatever I was doing to greet you when you come home from work, no more putting the volume on my walkman so loud that I couldn't hear you yell, no more trying to protect my mother and sister from you. 

No more feeling horribly torn between loyalty to you and loyalty to my own sanity. I pretended to like you.
I was so happy. 



But then my mom couldn't handle my sis and I and then I had to live with you so my mom could take better care of my sister. You came to pick me up and all the time you talked about your sexlife with your new girlfriend and how she told you that she'd never had someone as good as you. 


Living with you was weird. I cleaned and cooked and ironed your shirts. 


Then your new girlfriend turned out to be a lunatic.
Then you begged mom to take you back. 
So she took you back. 



I knew you were a lousy dad when you insisted on playing poker on the family computer when I was trying to sleep in the same room. You see, I was in the same room because my boss molested me over the course of 8 months. 
I was living in your attic, not sleeping, traumatized to the point where  I couldn't answer simple questions anymore like, what I liked to eat. I needed you dad, I needed you. 

But with only a curtain between us, you just had to play online poker. Ping! Ping! Ping! It was horrible. I stared at the walls and saw the night end and the day begin, still awake. Then i'd hear you come up the stairs around 9 in the morning, turn the pc on and? Ping! Ping! Ping!

You were a lousy dad because instead of asking me what happened, asking me why I wasn't talking, why I wasn't sleeping you yelled at me. You yelled “it's my right as a father to be proud of his daughter!” I let you yell at me and mom sat next to me, scared, begging you to stop. And then you collapsed. I went over to you and held you and escorted you to your bedroom where you fell onto the bed, crying, “please mazzy1978, don't leave, please don't leave.” I held you and promised i'd never leave.

I had a 32 hour contract and made more than €1700 euro's which, in 26 months, would have made me enough money to ask for a loan and start my own business. But you kept coming by and we started talking about becoming partner but i was still hesitant because i hadn't worked in 5 (!) years.

I kept saying no but then you wanted to talk to me about a full time position, all legit, with a guaranteed pay as manager so i took the bait and suit my stable job.

Then the drama started, you couldn't pay your bills so i said i was willing to work for less and all the overtime would be down payment for my 10 % of your café. You went on holiday THREE times and i fixed every problem there was, from all the electricity going out to an employee who was going to fill in your shifts, quitting the day after you left on holiday.

I had all the responsibilities of a business owner, i put new things on the menu, MY recipes, MY ideas. I convinced you to be open 7/7 because i believed that it would work and it DID. I trained all the new girls, i arranged the shifts, i was on stand by duty EVERY DAY. 

But then you decided you were gonna sell your café anyways. I was crushed, it was one day before x-mas, i cried the whole day, my dream was shattered. Two days later i saw you and told you, sell, but at least let me work until you find a buyer since i QUIT MY PREVIOUS JOB. 

Then you had a new idea, your sister was also going to buy 10 % and we were going to manage the bar together, i was super excited until, even before your sister said what she was going to add to the café, started sharing her demands. DEMANDS? She hasn't proven anything and she wants €11 an hour and vacation this, paid vacation that. WHAT?!?

I agreed to quit my job to become a partner so i wouldn't have to listen to a boss telling me what to do and now i have to bend over backwards for you two? I said i didn't want to become a partner anymore and then you said that you didn't want me in the bar anymore.

I have no idea how to deal with my friend and sister. I'm angry and sad. I can't seem to forgive them and i'm anxious to see how they deal with what happened but both my sister and my best friend aren't really talking to me about that night. They both said they were sorry and are kind of leaving it at that. 

We saw each other the following sunday and they were both extremely unpleasant to be around. My best friend didn't even speak about what happened and i got angry. I told her she was acting selfish and childish and left. 

I don't know how to show compassion.

Edit: some background information.

I met my friend (SB) in 2011. We shared a room in a mental health facility we were assigned to the same group and stayed there for 10 months. We became friends because we understood each other. My sister and SB became a couple in 2012.

SB has a horrible history of child abuse, she lived on the streets and met a (gay) boy there. They continued to live on the streets. Four years ago that boy killed himself and every year on that day, SB attempts to do the same. I was there for two of those attempts. First one was when i was still in the facility with her. The year after that (she was already together with my sister) i got a phonecall at 8 am. They told me she jumped of her roof and they found my phone number in her pocket. I went to the hospital and saw her, neckbrace, bloody, bruised all over, unable to speak. It was a horrible sight. 

I took care of everything. I told the therapist there that she had no family, that there was no where she could go because i wasn't stable enough to support her through this. I urged them to commit her. I then went to her apartment to collect the things she left on the roof (laptop etc) I saw the hole where she fell through the roof below her. 

Then i had to go tell my sister that her gf jumped of the roof. 

So the three of us know this happens every year. 

Maybe this explains a little bit the mixed emotions i'm having. 

I noticed that the past couple of weeks something was off with SB so i invited her several times to talk to me. She didn't. She tried but she just couldn't. 

Then saturday happened. 

I'm trying so hard to let them come to insights on their own time but on the other hand there's this immense fear of having to go through that all over again. Then there's the strong feeling that i'm doing all i can to be strong enough in case something does happen, while they imo continue making choices that makes matters worse.

Everyone else was drinking, my sister, her gf and my friend who invited me to the party. I saw them getting more and more drunk while i drank water and orange juice.

I saw them dancing like zombies, i saw them spilling drinks, arguing, falling over each other. 

All their emotions were amplified, their fun was fake. They spilled drinks over my pants and over each other. They yelled, they behaved less than human.

We left at 2 am.

My bike was at my friends house and i went to get it, came back to escort my sister and her gf home.

They fell off their bikes, smashing me to the ground. I told them to lock the bikes and called a cab.

They didn't have any money so i went to the bank and left them on the corner.

I come out of the bank and hear a loud banging. My sister is leaning against a lamppost, her gf is banging her head against another lamppost. I rush over and try to make her stop. She attacks me. She doesn't respond, just continues to bang her head hard.

I react from my gut. I wrap one arm around her neck and tackle her to the ground. She starts banging her head against the pavement hard. I put my hand in between her head and the pavement, she fights back. I keep saying her name, ""come back, wake up!"" She's gone.

Not knowing what to do i slap her in the face. She doesn't snap out of it. I keep saying her name, pleading to wake up, please wake up.

I slap her again. She opens her eyes, there are no pupils, just white. Finally she snaps out of it. I tell her everything is ok, i'm gonna get her home.

I manage to get both of them in the cab, i decide to ride with them because i'm afraid of what will happen if i leave them alone.

I help them up the stairs and put them to bed then walk home.

PTSD,"Last night I was feeling pent up, so I  decided to go on a nice long drive to get my mind off things. I played my first mix tape that I ever made, created in high school when I first started driving. I felt so connected with my old self and to the universe in general (the night has always been my spiritual time). It wasn't a profound ""third eye"" kind of intense feeling, but it was a simple joy that was easy to accept and hard to wish it was more. 

I decided to focus on what I understood to be the crown chakra. I basically ""placed"" my consciousness and vital energy just above the crown of my head. For a fleeting few minutes, I had no thoughts, I had no desires. It was just me and the road. To go from a mind with a history of racing thoughts, introspection, and anxiety to one of complete peace and quiet was amazing in its own way. 

But with me there is an equal and opposite reaction to happiness and insight gained. And I nearly self harmed when I got home from anger at guitar. The fact I didn't showed how much I had grown from this experience. And I feel I  now know the next step in my spiritual journey.",thesqueekyhinge
PTSD,"As I journey into sobriety again, I am deciding to tackle the big issues that are holding me back from being my best self. 

I have many talents, and I have visions of being a higher self in each. The ""rage to master"" component is prevalent in my mind in such a big way. And although it propels me forward it makes me hate myself.  

Today my postural correction exercises showed their progress in my lifting, and in my overall demeanor. 

Today I was able to ""unlock"" a mental cue that allowed me to gain an understanding of a new chakra. 

But today I decided to play my electric guitar after focusing on acoustic and drumming for a while. I decided to work on a song that I have been writing for years (can never be satisfied, eh). Understandably, I messed up a bit. As the feel is entirely different, and I haven't practiced it in a while. 

I got very angry. I felt like a failure.  If I hadn't used all of my mindfulness skills and breathing techniques, I would have started beating my own head in. This has happened before, to the point I would have a bad headache afterwords. 

If I saw anyone else in this state. I would hug them, cry with them, and try to let them know how strong their will is and how amazing it is that they try so hard after everything they've been through. But all I tell myself is that I'm a failure. That I shouldnt have spent so much time on the internet. That I should have worked on my technique instead of improvising. No matter what I do and how long I do it, it's never enough. I could always be better. 

That's all I have to write. I just wanted to put this here so I can look back on it later. Time to make my spirit a little lighter.",thesqueekyhinge
PTSD,"Went to the gym after class and did some quality work. 

Got a few drinks in me with some friends, just enough to get loose. And I watched some Trailer Park Boys  and had a lot of good belly laughs. The amount of weed content in the show got me a little longing though, but exposure to that kind of stuff is unavoidable. 

All in all I'm happy with how I spent my day today.

What's going on with you guys?",thesqueekyhinge
PTSD,"Lately I have been working on postural issues that have held back my lifting and psychosomatically keeping my confidence levels low. Today I came across some cues that have basically fixed my issues. It's amazing walking to class with my head literally held high. I feel more attractive, athletic, and I notice more attention from the opposite sex. It couldn't come at a better time because today was trying and stressful.

PTSD,"Today marks two weeks free from weed. Saying I haven't had cravings would be a bit of a lie, but so far I haven't reached a 50/50 point where I'm beginning rationalisation processes. And I'm hoping it stays that way.

I know it probably won't, but I hope that more great gifts come my way to bolster my resolve. My current anchors are music and lifting. Both would suffer if I smoke again, as the motivation to venture into new difficult tasks related to these would dissolve. 

I am finding things laugh out loud funny again. And tonight I'm going to listen to music on my good headphones to see if they have the same impact. 

I know my clean time ain't shit. But to those just starting, I've learned and appreciated more things about myself in these two weeks than I have the past year of stoned introspection. Smoking complicates the mechanisms in your mind, making a trip down the road into venturing around the world to reach the same destination.

PTSD,"There was a mix up at the dentist today. I was supposed to get a root canal, which took a lot of mental energy to get prepared for, but I ended up needing to be referred to another specialist. So another hard slept night full of anxiety and fear to come. 

The traumas of my past are not making me feel sorry for myself or causing me to feel sad and victimized like usual. They are instead making me angry. Angry at how people have wronged me, angry at what people could have done to help me, and angry at the double standards that allowed people to demonize me while downplaying or not recognizing my emotional needs. In short: Angry for being a scapegoat.

But the silver lining is that the thought of smoking was disgusting to me today. I knew it would do nothing but make me hate myself. Instead I'm going to lift my ass off. I'm going to play music. I'm going to play video games with my friends. And im going to put one more tally on the board. This isn't easy, but in a way all of this negativity is thrilling and reinforcing.  It's exciting to have a shitty day, because I know I'm not escaping to some fantasy land. I'm being an adult and I'm putting my nose to the grindstone. I'm giving back karmic energy to the universe that I took so much of during my daily use. It's time to get serious.",thesqueekyhinge
PTSD,"Today marks day 8 of my journey of sobriety. It has been more substantial than I could have imagined.  My lifting is getting a lot better, I find myself moved to tears (positive) by music and spiritual and introspective material that I come across and ponder.  Last night I had a dream where I had sex, which has never happened before in my life (dreaming about it I mean, I have had numerous intercourses). I also have less apprehension when it comes to standing up for myself to my parents and my peers. 

But every up has a down and there as some things that weed kept at bay that are coming into my life. Though I  having dreams, I am also having nightmares about traumatic experiences in my life that sometimes startle me awake.  It is also hard to turn down the voltage on my batteries to actually fall asleep ( usually around 3-4 o clock at night is when it happens). I am also finding myself craving alcohol more than usual. And I am buying black and milds every other day or so (after previously quitting). 

But these drawbacks pale in comparison to the growth that my spirit will undergo. And every day is now a personal record and an empowering experience.  My tics are coming back a little bit as well, but I was always aware that this would be a lifelong battle either way. 

Keep on trucking everyone. Let's keep on donning heavier armor together.",thesqueekyhinge
PTSD,"For a whole now every Friday my friends and I would convene, smoke, listen to music, and watch Netflix. I texted my friends yesterday being truthful about wanting to stop for at least the rest of the month.  I was honest and said I wanted vivid dreams, quiet my mind, and take a step forward in life (the last part I didn't say though, they aren't the best those kinds of conversations). So far they haven't answered. 

Ill probably have some wine if we chill at my place, and Im worried that the alcohol will erode my resolve. I want to do more than just sit in a little pocket and hide from the world (with them I mean, I never really had a period of low functioning). But there really isn't much to do where I live besides that that doesn't cost a fortune. 
I feel like I have a part of the blame in all of this, since I was THE provider for a long time and kinda set this status quo in place. 

I also had cheap cigar last night which I feel bad about. Today is gonna be rough.",thesqueekyhinge
PTSD,"Yesterday was a rough day so I had trouble sleeping. But when I did I had a dream from the perspective of a camera filming Star Wars.  The most vivid thing I remember is C3P0 saying ""Master Luke is one of the most talented individuals in the entire universe."" REM sleep is a strange thing.

I can't wait for a fantasy dream instead of a reality with a little fuzzy filter and a tiny sense of contentment.  It's gonna be hard when I get home from class at 10:00 though :/.",thesqueekyhinge
PTSD,"Hey all. Things have really sucked lately. My first date that I've had in two years was just a girl trying to rope me into some get rich quick scheme and my dentist told me I needed a root canal. I broke down and cried for four hours to my mom and spilled my guts out with all of my pent up feelings. It would not have happened if I smoked today.

Weed makes me hide my true feelings because I'm paranoid that I will be judged for them. Weed adds a filter to my mind that keeps me from being spontaneous and makes me calculate my every move. My appetite is shit now to the point where I have an eating disorder basically (binge eating). Weed makes me hang out with the same people all the time and not take social risks. Weed has stopped me from wholesomely enjoying life. Weed has made me a sensation seeker. Weed has disconnected my soul and my spirit. Weed has been the underlying cause of very fixable problems that are not being changed. Weed has damaged my relationship with my parents. Weed may have caused the resurgence of transient tics I had during childhood. Weed may have catalyzed my girlfriend cheating on me. Weed is causing me a lifetime of problems for two hour increments of bliss. 

As much as I try to convolute my issues into a game of blaming, resentment, and anger. I know I wouldnt be where I am now if a plant didn't fill the place in my heart where people should have been. 

I wish I could take back all of the negativity I brought forth because of my lack of honesty with myself. Weed has made me choose the path of least resistance. A victim. 

I want money, I want love, I want success. And weed is eroding my chances at all of them. Weed can help many people. But I am not one of them.",thesqueekyhinge
PTSD,"In my ruminations I always try to think of a way to explain my mind to a non-sufferer and I think I've found an effective one.  Living with this disease is like using a computer with the task manager always on. You become aware of processes and details about yourself that a normal person would have no need to ponder. A constant concern of how well you are performing and what processes are taking place, and every new task needs to be inspected to make sure you have enough processing power to perform. Even when you know you do, you still check over and over to make sure you aren't overloaded. But this process, in itself, overloads you and can cause you to crash. I guess the trick is learning not to pay attention to the manager and instead focus on the programs themselves, and eventually you'll know instinctively what you can handle and what you can't.

PTSD,"When I described my dream to someone they basically told me that I was so ""descriptive"" of the dream that I was obviously making it up. I mean, I don't think recurring dreams are normal human behavior.... But when it happens multiple times I think I might retain few extra details than what's ""normal"" when I wake up. 

It isn't a memory dream, or a trauma dream... It's actually pretty creepy. Perhaps a subconscious dream? I'm not sure... I'm not well educated in these things. But it has popped up over the years. 

Please feel free to skip the dream description if you feel it might trigger you; that is absolutely *not* what I want.

Starts out with me in a room talking with a female on a couch casually, almost as if she's my best friend? Honestly, I have no clue who she is when I wake up. Can't put a face and name to this person. 

Suddenly, she runs out of this house, and that's always the point I realize I have no idea what house I am in, or whose couch I am on.... So I'm confused, and sit there. I see the front door open again, and she comes running in screaming so loud and throws her head in my lap, crying. But noise (I think?) suddenly doesn't exist. I mean serious silence in my dream.... 

I wish I could describe to you better what I see.. But I turn my head to the other side of the room and someone wearing some kind of.... Mask? Almost like a creepy ass gas mask? Well this ""head"" pokes it's head out from that other hallway, and then really strange kind of ""claw like"" fingers sort of curl around the wall.... And just stares at me. And I look at the girl in my lap who seemingly is sobbing, and look back at the ... Whatever that person is... And basically I start running around this strange house for what I know the remainder of the dream.... Chased. 

But whenever I am cornered by this thing I duck down or dive somehow miraculously away or past it, and keep running to hide or escape. 

I don't know. I think this is trauma related subconsciously... But I was severely invalidated by that comment. Does anyone else experience something even remotely similar? I mean I'm not having this dream every single night (thank god) but the fact that I brought it up and received that reaction makes me hesitant to ever talk about it again.... So I guess I have finally summoned the courage to turn to reddit.

Edit: haven't been on in a few days but all of my wow, I'm so happy others have had at least similar experiences. It makes me feel better. Going to try responding to all of you now, thank you guys. Seriously. ",EveryoneHasMonsters
PTSD,"For the past 3-4 months every single week I have noticed at least one or more bruises showing up on my right leg only. It's been really strange. After I started to see a pattern of  a new tiny bruise showing up every few days I started to correlate if this is possibly connected to bad dreams. (Bad dreams is a rather sweet way of calling it... But they are bad nonetheless) 

Before my most recent two bruises, it was three bruises on the side of my leg, about the size of my 3 side fingers minus the pinky. Now my last two are at the top of my leg, and I noticed they are both the size of my thumb, and very dark black... The darkest bruises yet. 

Now I'm wondering if I'm self harming in my sleep unintentionally. Has anyone else done this? It's taken me months to notice, and now I don't know how to fix it. ",EveryoneHasMonsters
PTSD,"So after many years of struggling through my anxiety, depression, paranoia, and probably self destruction... I have finally considered in a serious matter of seeking professional help. 

Not going to spread my stories, so no triggers here, friends; but I endured a very horrific relationship in my teenage years and beyond high school. I go through flashbacks, nightmares, disassociation, and outbursts.... My current BF, who has stayed with me through all of this, years ago mentioned one night crawling into bed, ""do you think you have PTSD?"" That question struck me hard, I had never even considered it until that moment. 

I was watching some TV show a few months ago where PTSD hit the plot line and actually had me bawling my eyes out on the couch. I started googling the signs. Everything I found described me so perfectly that it actually was kind of a relief, in a very strange way. 

Now that I am feeling ""comfortable"" (if that's what you want to call it) with the idea, I still struggle to say the words out loud... Even if I'm alone in my living room. I want the help, I ""want"" the diagnosis I suppose... Just so I can perhaps start making strides at getting better. 

But I'm afraid.

 I am afraid of being vulnerable, or of finding a therapist that would berate me and make me feel worse, or maybe afraid that nobody will understand why I'm like this. 

Has anyone else gone through this transition? What helped you finally take that step to seek the help that you wanted in therapy? 

I have a daughter, she is so young. I don't want her to grow up with me constantly depressed or on edge.... Or maybe I don't want her being afraid of the world the way that I am. I don't know... I just don't want her living her life feeling the way that I do.

It's pretty lengthy though, and honestly I don't want people to read it if it will put them down, or trigger anything for themselves. I mostly posted to try and free my mind a bit, as anonymously as possible. 

I digress... 

Because of the things that have happened in my teenage years, it's all starting to really affect me now. I used to just drink myself numb every night, but now I'm a mommy I definitely cannot retract to those bad habits. It's affecting my relationship with my boyfriend, and I find now it's even affecting my ability to fully enjoy the life of my daughter. The depression and anxiety is all pretty overwhelming. 

Since I'm a stay at home mom I have no income of my own, and with a lot of bad tension and fighting with my boyfriend over the past year I feel like I'm just a nuisance to him...

PTSD,"No one understands what happened to me. Right after my mom died when I was 14 I met an older woman at church who groomed me by acting like a mother figure to me. The first night I spent at her house she grabbed my hand to hold it, cuddled me into her boobs,took me into her bed, spooned me, then the next morning she was kissing my back. By guilt and shame I kept quiet and wasn't able to get out of the situation till I moved away. She took my virginity as well as making me perform all sexual acts including oral. Vaginal and anal penetration. She liked light bdsm also. She used a strap on on me and vice versa. It even got to the point of her threatening her life when I tried to get out...and I was really fucking stupid. I never had parents and I was just really young and confused. Fuck this bitch. Just had a dream she died. She's currently dieing of cancer but hopefully the legal action will be taken care of before that. Most people I tell don't get it. Their reaction I believe , though I can't be sure, is disgust. Without the support of my boyfriend the first person I told, I wouldn't have made it to where I am now.

My parents were unable to care for me because they were drug and alcohol addicts. Mental abuse and my early life developed me into a very vulnerable, scared, anxious teenager. I couldn't talk to my grandparents about much without getting negative feed back, so I mostly kept to myself and good friends were hard to come by. At 14 my mother died. A few months later I was molested and made to have a relationship with a 38 year old women whom I met at church. She groomed me by acting like a mother figure ...she wouldn't let me leave the relationship without making me feel enormously guilty- she brainwashed me. I am now in the process of taking legal action against her. My grandparents could have prevented it but didn't. And I understand but then I don't.  I moved away from my grandparents when I was 17 and 1/2, after I graduated high school. I met a wonderful guy and after moving around a bit settled across the country with him. So I am now away from my grandparents and that horrid woman.. but the ptsd is still there. I think it will always be. My anxiety got so bad I started having panic attacks ...

This led to a 4 day hospital visit, a diagnosis of depression (that because of my family history will likely morph into bipolar), PTSD, and a prescription of Prozac. Since I left the hospital I've been feeling weird. At first I thought it was just be readjusting to and being overwhelmed from the real world. 

I've spent the past two weeks feeling high. I can't concentrate, I've started having intensely realistic dreams that when I wake up from them I'm not sure where I am for what day/time it is. I keep catching myself being mesmerized by shadows and lines, seeing patterns in my house that I've never noticed before, and even seeing patterned curtains move as if blown by a soft breeze. I've described it to friends as the feeling when mushrooms start to take affect. A mere sip of beer or coffee (the later also makes me dizzy. It used to take 2 cups for me to even feel it) increases it. But I'm not sad. But I don't want to die anymore.

I identify as Hispanic and as a Latina; my father is Mexican and my mother is British (immigrated at 16; Irish/Welsh). I don't have much experience with my Hispanic culture, but I am proud of the traditions I know and was taught growing up. Some of them should be scrutinized, but overall, I think most traditions have their place and context. Most of my Hispanic heritage comes from Mexico and northern New Mexico. All that is just for some context.

My friend is white and starts talking about not having had a sweet sixteen. She then looks to me and says:
""Hey, I'm just going to throw myself a Quincenera; want to come?"" 
I was a little taken aback, but just scoffed and asked her if she knew what that was. She replied ""a Mexican sweet sixteen right?"" 
I don't know what it was, but that flippant attitude pissed me off and made me feel a little weird (ashamed/ridiculed maybe?) about my Latina identity. It just felt like privilege; it's ok for her to throw a Quincenera at 25 like a sweet sixteen playing whatever music she wants, inviting whomever friends, and generally making a mockery of a familial tradition. It's ok because it's ""cute"" when she would do it. Had I had a Quincenera myself, it would have been lots of family, religious iconography, a celebration of a sexist, albeit less so today, tradition.

It took me about a week to be able to even keep up the hoop, but it was something I looked forward to. It was a small challenge that I knew I could do.

I have lost over 100 pounds over the last 14 months, and the first time I found this sub, I started buying bras at Dillard's. They worked pretty good for a while, but I quickly noticed problems, so maybe I could get some reccomendations to try in some newer sizes?

* Freya Deco T-shirt bra 34 G worked great for a little while; the wires were too narrrow and the band seemed too thin and not supportive enough. The gore tacks, is a little squishy, aka I can push it against where my breasts bleed into each other and get boob popping out the top. I got some quad boob, more so now, but the cups seem not projected enough at the bottom (the band beneath the cups ride down in front and pinches). Now the band is just big and the cups are doing this whole too small at the bottom too big at the top thing.

* Fantasie Salsa 32 H (UK?) was ugly, but comfy. The top of the cups cut in at the my breast tissue and it didn't seem to really give me any lift. I just felt like I was being held there. The gore used to tack, but now it kind of leans to my smaller side. There seemed to be too much projection at the nipple in this bra, which would get baggy, and the wires were almost wide enough, but still not there. Plus, the straps fall down all the time, even when tightened to the max.
 
* Cabernet full-busted bra 34 H (US). Surprsingly, these seemed to fit the best, but I think it's because I don't know what a good fitting bra looks or feels like yet. The gore lays against my sternum, but again, when I press on it, there's a lot of squishyness and I get some quad(sexta?)boob, band riding, and other tell-tall sighs of too small band, too big cup. But, the style provides great lift and shape for me.

* Le Mystere Dream Tisha balconette 34 H Fr. This bra I got suckered into buying before I knew about the difference between French, European, and UK sizing. Major quadboob, no gore tacking, digging straps, and too narrow wires.

* Natori convertable sports bra 34 H, because the 32 was the first bra that I had ever tried that actually was difficult to get around me. Plus, for the sale price, I can live with a little bit of quadboob/boob pain from the wires for the sake of containment and great support. While I got this bra, for what it's worth, I also tried a Freya active sport (?) in a 32G(GG?) and it gave me that upside down 7 shape that I've heard of. Maybe this can help with suggestions too?

Snug Underbust: 34.5 inches
BTT: 30.5 inches
Standing Bust: 42 inches
Bent Over Bust: 45 inches
Laying Bust: 43 inches

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/92AT0) is an album NSFW, boobs in bra, of me in a Fantasie Salsa and Freya Deco (the deco is beige, the salsa is sheer grey).

I think I may be shallow, full on bottom, with a very wide AND tall root, and I also have several cup sizes worth of breast tissue beneath my arms. You can see more unmigrated tissue on my back. I used to be fitted into B and C cups for all my life, until I came here and realized that the tissue under my arms wasn't just some kind of deformity like I thought it was, that was boob!

Anyway, the band doesn't seem to ride up in the Fantasie, but it still feels pretty loose. I may have some bias about tightness though, because I am no stranger to corseting and have been told I ""compress"" pretty easily. That being said, the prospect of going to a 30, or even 28, band doesn't scare me, but I don't know how that would affect how my tissue is encapsulated.
The gore on both these bras tack, by the way, even with all the quadboobing on the Freya. What's up with that?

The cups on both these bras have some obvious problems though. On the Fantasie, my breasts finally have a wide enough wire to actually lay inside of the cup, but I get the orange in a glass effect, and the tops of the cups cut into my upper breast tissue. On the Freya, the cups wrinkle at the bottom and sometimes gape at the top.
Another note the underwires: in the Freya, they really don't feel wide enough, and I feel lke my breasts may actually be pushing them wider, hence the bagginess at the bottom of the cup? On the Salsa, I've read reviews that the wires were insanely wide, but they happen to be just the right width. What other bras are out there like this? I saw from some of the resources here that Curvy Kate is probably my best bet. Which Curvy Kate, or similar bra, should I try out?

I really, really love the shape my Freya gives, and I feel kind of unattractive in the Salsa, like my breasts are way too low on my body. I would really love a balconette, to be honest, but I wanted to start with whatever Dillard's had to offer and then get more specified directions, hopefully, after posting here.

PTSD,"So, we've had a slew of hateful posts/comments directed towards sufferers of PTSD who aren't combat vets. What I can't figure out is why these posts weren't immediately deleted. We have a rule in the sidebar that states ""Cursing is fine, but hostility towards other posters will not be tolerated."" If ""fuck your shitty traumatic childhood"" and being told to Get the Fuck Out isn't hostile, I'm not sure what is. 

Could we please institute more formal policies or something from this? The last thing ANY of us need is to come to this thread for support only to be attacked. Now, I understand that most of the recent posts came from a single user who appears to have deleted their account, but the fact that the posts themselves still exist means that anyone who comes to this sub for the first time is going to assume that we condone these comments.

I'd like to suggest that we implement something along the lines of a 3-day ban on users who post comments attacking anyone else's PTSD as a first time warning along with deleting the comment and posting of a response explaining in detail why their comments/posts were out of line and what they could do better in the future. I completely get that this person was really just seeking validation, but I don't feel like we should allow the tone of our entire sub to be dragged down by this sort of rhetoric. 

Does anyone else have any other comments or suggestions? 

Edit: So, what I've gotten out of this discussion so far is A: The mods have been non-responsive and something should probably be done about that. And B: there's not a whole lot of consensus about what the purpose of this sub is. It sounds like some of us are viewing it as something like a support group, and others see it as a place for the dissemination of information only. I'm not sure what to do with those bits of information.

I've also concluded that unless some things drastically change, I need to disengage from this subreddit and find a more supportive place. This makes me sad because this place was incredibly helpful to me for quite awhile. But the hostility of the responses directed towards me for simply asking that we be more compassionate towards each other and trying to understand other peoples point of view has quite honestly left me shaking and nauseous all afternoon. I'm unsubbing at least for awhile and I wish you all well.

PTSD,"TW: Suicide, Giant Spiders

A friend of a friend posted this to facebook today and almost cried when I read it. http://9gag.com/gag/a2NXEze
It says that it is a poster that hangs in a therapists office and has saved lives. And while the poster itself is specific to depression and to therapists, I think the sentiment applies to everyone who has made it here as well, whether they are seeing a therapist or not. A therapist might hand out better, larger, more useful sticks. But if you're here, it means you've come looking for a stick. All we can do is hand out the little sticks we've got. You're the one doing the surviving. Congratulations, you're awesome!

The whole text for anyone who doesn't want to click the link:

I don't like the phrase ""a cry for help."" I just don't like how it sounds. When somebody says to me ""I'm thinking about suicide, I have a plan; I just need a reason not to do it,"" the last thing I see is helplessness.

I think: Your depression has been beating you up for years. It's called you ugly, and stupid, and pathetic, and a failure, for so long that you've forgotten that it's wrong. You don't see any good in yourself and you don't have any hope. 

But still, here you are; you've come over to me, banged on my door and said ""**Hey!** Staying alive is **really hard** right now! Just give me something to fight with! I don't care if it's a stick! Give me a stick and I can stay alive!""

How is that helpless? I think that's incredible. You're like a Marine: trapped for years behind enemy lines, your gun has been taken away, you're out of ammo, you're malnourished, and you've probably caught some kind of jungle virus that's making you hallucinate giant spiders.

And you're still just going: **""Give me a stick, I'm not dying out here!""**

""A cry for help"" makes it sound like I'm supposed to take pity on you. But you don't need my pity. This isn't pathetic. This is the will to survive. This is how humans lived long enough to become the dominant species. 

With **NO** hope, running on **NOTHING**, you're ready to cut through a hundred miles of hostile jungle with nothing but a stick, if that's what it takes to get to safety. 

All I'm doing is handing out sticks. 

You're the one staying alive.

And every single time I sit down to work on my designs I have a panic attack and have to stop. The only time I made progress on it was when my mom sat down with me for a bit to talk through my ideas. I used to be so creative but I just feel so dull and lifeless. I constantly feel on the edge of crying and I have no idea what to do.

Maybe I shouldn't have gone to college right after high school. I haven't healed, but what the hell does that even mean? Am I ever going to be able to handle the stress? What should I do? I feel so lost and hopeless.",diggingaditch

PTSD,"So reading through this sub, I've noticed a lot of people saying that a certain degree isn't worth the amount of student loans. Clearly, what is reasonable amount of debt seems to be based on what your degree is in. My question is what would be a simple rule of thumb without getting too vague. For example, should it be only take out what your starting salary would be? Or max potential?

Of course, this question hits home. I'm in school for engineering, and I'll be graduating with roughly $50K in loans (only federal). However, median starting salary in my field is $60K, and grows rapidly with experience.",diggingaditch
PTSD,"I'm relatively far into my recovery: I haven't had a flashback since December (anyone else feel like an alcoholic when they say that?), I haven't struggled with dissociation in a good while, and I'm actively building intimate relationships. But I still deal with cycling between emotional poles. Not nearly as extreme, I used to cycle from deep depression and dissociation to hyper vigilance, hyper efficiency, and sometimes impulsive sex (I used to struggle with sex addiction pretty bad, no more). Now, I cycle from a relatively normal range of emotions (happy, a bit sad, a bit upset, etc) to soul sucking depression. I mean, the depression is definitely better than before as I'm mostly functional and not lying in bed all day. And it's not enough to qualify as bipolar, my therapist and I have already discussed that possibility.

I guess I just want to know if anyone else can relate.",diggingaditch

PTSD,"Talking with my partner last night, I went over a couple ideas. Just for clarification, this would be an indoor use only hammock. I have another hammock that I brought in Puerto Rico that started my love for hammocks. If I ever want to do an outdoor hammock, I'd probably buy one.

* Knitted: knit a pretty cover of my own design (probably out of cotton for breathability and lack of stretch) and sew it to heavy cotton duck. Then grommet it and use some sort of metal chain (I make chainmaille and would probably do something cool out of titanium) as a substitute for ropes.

* Leather: use leather as the main body, the load bearing member, and then sew a backing to it, something comfy but breathable for the side you lay on, then again grommeting with metal chains. This idea is mainly because a leather hammock sounds awesome. Would I have issues with it stretching? I want to say no.

* Knitted/chainmaille monstrosity: knit the size of hammock I want, and then weave a chainmaille pattern into it for strength. Originally imagining it was using a 4 in 1 pattern in stockinette, but I'd probably use a different chainmaille pattern that lays flatter and a yarn that soft enough to counteract the feeling of woven in metal. This time, I'd just straight weave in the chains to the end.

What problems can you foresee me having? What problems have you had with your hammocks?

Edit: an extra idea. The entire body of it being made out of chainmaille, flat part, rope, everything. Then backed ith some material that has to be thick enough to not feel the rings but also be breathable. Gonna have to check out how thick you can get cotton duck. Leather isn't an option, too sticky.",diggingaditch

PTSD,"Just wondering about this, primarily because it easily takes out the pressure of ""do they want kids"" because of the fact they don't need to fulfill every need for you. For example, I have several partners: one significantly older man who already has two kids, another man who doesn't want kids, and another who, if he were to have kids, it would be with the partner he lives with. My point here is that my decision to not have children hasn't limited who I can have relationships with, which is pretty great. Plus, for the random urges of ""kids are kinda cute"", I talk to my partner who has kids and he regales me with stories of when they were young, and even better/worse, the drama with their mother.",diggingaditch
PTSD,"Hey folks, I just wanted to let you know that after around 28 years and multiple attempts at everything under the sun to deal with my ptsd, it is finally gone. Just.. gone. I got a stellate ganglion block from my neurologist who I've been seeing for an unrelated back injury. I gave him a stack of docs from the walter reed studies and he agreed to give it a shot. 

Within literally minutes, every symptom I've struggled with (burning physical pain, anxiety, vigilance) was just totally gone. I can't fucking believe it. No nightmares... I can finally sleep. This is amazing. I'm beyond grateful.

This is a fucking CURE. If you have access to a good neurologist, get him to do this. NOW. The only side effect is my hands don't sweat anymore and I can now feel the effects of caffeine. My body is no longer screaming that I'm in danger. I almost don't know what to do with myself. 


* UPDATE *
Got a few PMs asking for updates, but hadn't checked this account in a while.
It's been six months now. I had two follow up shots. I can still sleep through the night. Nightmares are not really a problem anymore. Hyper-vigilance hasn't happened in ages. I consider my PTSD to be cured at this point. Now time to work on all my other neurotic shit. :)

Mine is NC his are LC both live far enough away to not cause too much trouble, his siblings live close, but he isn't as close with them (parents have literally plotted to keep them all apart since they were kids... so none of them are particularly close and my husband is definitely the one who got the most abuse outwardly) we are both in individual counseling (he finally admitted he needed it himself and did it himself) we also see a couples counselor. We have generally a great relationship and love each other very much. The problem is that we both have FLEAS. Bad. I can sometimes see when I mess up and say something really messed up and apologize for it. He sometimes doesn't see it at all. This is also complicated because he has Aspergers. So anyhow... I am looking for some  ideas on what to say to your significant other.. Who I know doesn't mean the things he does and says. He is just healing like me. Just as depressed and hurt by these people who he thought cared about him. I am just at a loss of how to act around him anymore when he exhibits these fleas... he is not a N. So I'm not too keen on treating him like I treat my N parents when they are being typical ns. There is no battle to win with him. I just want him to be happy :( even talked to him about it, but it's still a struggle. We go to our couples counseling tomorrow, but I just wanted to know if there was anyone else who has SO's with Fleas and how do you deal... seeing as I also have fleas... its hard not to make a knee jerk reaction to his fleas :( any words of advise greatly appreciated.

We rent a house in Northern Oregon. We are incharge of our gardening, which we all dont mind because we like being outside. Problem is that when we moved in it was already way too late to cut back the already semi overgrown bushes and flowers around the house, by the time it stopped raining everyday this year they are already WAY too overgrown. We have limited funds, and kind of crappy tools (although we are planning on getting better ones asap). Is it better to just call a professional to take care of it at this point? Also if anyone knows offhand how much that would cost? or is there a way to do it cheaper (even with the cost of tools) ourselves?

PTSD,"My husband knows I stalk this subreddit, and told me I should ask you guys for suggestions. We are pregnant with our first, both sets of our parents (step and birth) are all either N's and/or other mental issues. My parents will never see their grandchild (No contact for quite some time), and his parents will only see the baby supervised by us, never alone and only for short lengths of time. Luckily we live a state away from everyone at least, so it makes things a lot easier! My good family; my grandma, aunt and uncle and cousins are the only people who are actually excited and supportive anyways as far as family is concerned. 

 His biological mom and step dad have serious issues. Step dad is an alcoholic and a classic N, mother is an enabler of dad and when not making snarky comments to her own children, sends ""parenting advice"" to us by email (REALLY terrible advice she thinks are wonderful) Thats about how involved they have been with our future child, she barely even asks how I am doing when he calls every few weeks. Then my bio dad and step mom raised me, both N's and divorced; only my father remarried. I also have a bio mom and he has a bio dad whom both of us have had in and out of our lives due to drugs/alcohol/voluntary homelessness/jail (pick one, or two). Obvuiously these people will have little to no contact with our children for their safety. 

Now with having some background...the question:
we bought a baby memories book, and have been filling it in. We got to the part about the family tree and both have no idea what to put. Honestly either of us doesnt have an opinion one way or the other about it.

It is also good to note that I have a chronic illness (Nmom knows this), and sometimes I am so sick I can barely make it out of bed. Definitly not well enough to type a message (not like she ever responds to them anyways) and certainly not enough to make a phone call (I also have PTSD from my Bipolar Dad, Druggie Birth Mother, and Pedo Step Father, phone calls trigger a LOT of anxiety for me, which Nmom knows and never respects our phone calls.

She said I more than likely had the type that would get worse over time.  I had assumed this meant years,  not months.

Starting to worry me also,  obviously.  They are always the same and when igetthem when standing up it's almost like everything starts turning white and closing in... then I either sit down right away and wait for it to pass,  on fall flat on my face. When I finally come back I am super nauseous,  and have a hard time for a few mins talking and slurring my words.  I usually catch them before they get to the hit the floor stage.  But it's still scary as hell. My hope is thatin January when I get my next financial aid check to get this thing in Nevada called access to health network,  which is basically discounted medical.  It's not insurance,  but I can't afford to pay someone out of pocket at all,  so anything less than $200 a visit is amazing.  I am a full time student at a community college,  and no they don't have student insurance available.  So my I have to wait till mid January to apply for the discount thing and hope for the best.  My question is in the meantime is there anything I can do?  My quality of life is pretty awful right now,  sleeping a lot,  can hardly eat,  pain has gotten worse.  I only have 10 days left in the semester but I can tell you this last month my grades have been taking a hit,  thank god some of my teachers are understanding,  even without a doctors note or anything. But it's been a really rough semester to say the least.  So is there anything I can do to improve my quality of life until I can see a doctor?  Also,  when I do I would like some advise on what I should ask them?  Or what tests I should ask then to do?   

in case it gets asked,  I rarely do drugs,  as in a few times of year at best,  and only pot.  I do drink,  but on rare occasions, socially,  and that means I haven't in a longer time than I care to admit.

(I have some limited medical background I might add so I am somewhat knowledgeable, so don't take me as a crazy webmd websurfer hypochondriac. I get that a lot until people meet Me...)

EDIT: Some thing I just thought of that might be helpful, I have severe itching on my legs, only my legs, it doesnt go away, even while wearing clothes, tried every lotion, tried antihistamines as well. I also have severe thirst a lot of the time. especially before bed, or waking up. I dont drink caffeinated drinks (soda, or coffee, some tea). And I do have PTSD. And I have had my gallbladder removed.

I have also been having this pain on my right side right under my ribs, day ot night, it just shows up randomly, if i dont lean my body in that direction, or dont lay on that side it goes away after an hour or so. yesterday though It wouldnt, and i fell asleep  on left side, woke up and it had increased in intensity, and had worked its way up to right around my breast area and wrapped around it... pain was major intense, and i couldnt even focus on stuff, I propped a pillow up in that area and after about an hour or so it went away.

PTSD,"So when I was a kid I read a lot.  Like everything and anything I could get my hands on.  So one day,  I was reading this story about this village that was like olden times (think 1800's on the orator,  but instead in the woods)  but they we're secretly part of this whole exhibit in a museum and had no idea until one day one of the girls finds a way out. They also had this part where she was fascinated by color,  because she hadn't ever seen some colors.   That's as far as I remember the book.  So flash forward to when The Village came out.  I'm sitting in the movie theater and am like OMG this is so unoriginal,  even the character names we're the same.  I'm telling everyone,  I read a book about this.  This movie is based off a book.  I then have spent ever since looking for that book to no avail.  It does not exist. I know I read the book and while the story line isn't exactly,  it was creepy similar.  I know I didn't imagine it either. ",bravenewgirl85

Everyone loved the first session, great game solid fun. Here is where the trouble starts, almost every session after that, someone said something about his additions to Hord of the Dragon Queen. Help has been offered in the way of balancing. This last session sealed it though. He claims that the book called for the six lvl 3 PC's to fight the CR 4 half-dragon and two CR 2 Beserkers. He felt that was too easy so he added the CR 2 female caster from the cult, and 6 bandits... oh our Fighter and thief were unable to make it, one for work reasons, one for family issues (this also left her unable to attend DnD on our weekly meet up date), they were downed to zero first round (before my 24 initiative),  our barbarian was unable to make it last session, so logically... he was tied up for five rounds bound by iron on each limb... and after that was only really offered improvised weapons (weapons disappearing or being thrown on death as part of their deaths). The CR 4 half dragon matches in and smashes our wizard for 12, and our cleric for 15 downing him. My first round is spent casting a cure wounds spell which apparently did not revive our leader(the man valiantly manning his post at subway, a muse among mere sandwich novices), and thus went the first of many long painful rounds. The war of attrition continued, our barbarian finally broke free around the same time that the CR 4 half dragon broke my iron maiden phantasmal force. He then wrecked all of us, the Barbarian received two rounds of combat before being feared past everyone, who were all happy to AoO him to death. In the end. 5 players failed death saves, one made it and was executed. I called him out on putting 3 1/2(tied up barbarian and all) level 3 players against 5000+ exp of monsters, his response, you had six players... he exploded at me over the phone, quit the game... now hours later he wants to talk about it.

PTSD,"Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring
undead under your control, even those created by other
wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that
you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must
make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard
spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature
on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and
obeys your commands until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.
If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has
advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving
throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can
repeat the saving throw at the end o f every hour until it
succeeds and breaks free.


I'm running a horror campaign that focus quite a bit on Undead, and Lovecraftian horrors. When I first read it I was a little worried, then I did some digging.

Their are 28 Undead monsters in the MM. Out of those 28, 11 have a CR of 5 or more, out of those 11, only 1 has an Int of 7 or less (which means they make the save as normal.) The other undead who have an INT of 7 or less are all around CR 1/2 to CR 3 I.E. not even close to suitable for a 14th level adventuring party.


So how much real use can a Necromancer get out of that end cap? At 14th level, assuming a +5 in INT with a proficiency of +5, the undead must beat a DC 18 VS their CHA, again I thought, AHA! Now it gets useful, undead are Charismaless punks... No, not really, out of the 28 undead, 13 of them have a +2 or more in their CHA, while 11 of them have +0 or less.


Now I get it, its a Hail Mary, you either get it off and it works and everyone pats the Necromancer on the back while the DM fumes a bit at having an encounter shut down, or it doesn't work, and that's one action down the drain against a pretty bad ass Undead.

The ring has 4 charges and regains 2 charges daily at dawn, you may take the following actions with these charges. Gust of Wind - you can expend 1 charge to cast Gust of Wind with a dc of 14. Fly - You can expend 2 charges to cast the fly spell (self only) however your flight speed is 40ft instead of the normal 60ft.

EDIT: The reason I asked is because of a house rule that was posted by u/unsight : You can swap elements on spells that only do damage provided the new element is as common or more common than the original (You can swap a fireball to cold damage but not force damage). This swap is permanent

So going by the link provided by u/edgeofdreams

This is listed by the most resisted to the least resisted (and grouped for the house rule)

1.) Cold, Fire, Lightning and Poison

2.) Necrotic and Acid

3.) Radiant, Force, psychic, and Thunder

So by the house rule, you could move up the list when changing the Damage type of the spell just not down it.

As for rune sets, I am quite good with Nordic runes, Lovecrafts Diary (font that looks runic, easy to find via Google), and an angelic set I made.

So... anyone intrigued? Please upvote, comment or send me a PM.

Red robes with black stitching in symbols all unfamiliar to me and my narrow scope of languages, however just looking over them I coud see them writhe on their cloaks. The masks they wore, well I want to say the doctors new face gear was worn, but instead those faces, they seem to be wearing the doctors, pulling them along by nose and teeth, the only thing akin to it that I've seen is a horse being lead by a bridal. Their arms moved like delicately controlled marionette puppet but their voices still their own they called for the subject. 



They attache more IVs to his arm and his face contorted even more. When they furst started cutting into his chest it was with the usual tools of the traid, but as they cut away more and more they tools became archaic, until they were cracking his chest open with a hammer and chisel, the cracking was sickening. And soon I saw it, his heart being removed, the black tar they had been pumping into him was oozing out of the heart, and they placed it in a bag, and started pooring a couple bags of the black gunk into his cavity before stitching him up.  After they finished they started in on his head, pulling it apart and removing his brains in a matter of minutes he was sown up and with a large scar now dominating the right side of his face, and it oozed black. As my stomach was starting to settle they brought it in, the wheeled the massive tumor into the room, and hacked off a large chunk and then i knew where that thick ichor originated, from this thing! They held buckets under it to catch its drippings, and lest I forget what followed being so distracted by the bleeding monstrosity, the chunk they cut of soon made its way to the operating table, and into the mouth of the subject. I could watch no more and fled from that place, home I drove like a mad man. Were I not in such a manic state I would have noticed the two cops I blew past, they did nothing.


Over the next few days I pushed  my luck with the law. Was it out of a desire to learn or a lack of care for my own well being, I'm sure it was both. I started by speeding past cops, they did nothing, from there I moved to assault, and as soon as I shouted that I was with REDACTED Medical Center I was released with an apology.

This hospital has a lot of power in my town, they own every clinic, every dentist, basically if you get cut on, or sent to it by a doctor, they own it. As such I wouldn't be surprised if evey cop and military personal in the town had been cut on by them, why is that important? Because every single one had something taken from them. Every. Single. One.

Well its about 4am and my shift is almost over 3 more hours and I'm free! All this is going through my head when on of the doctors come in, you could tell because he had on his black tie with the red stag horn the all the doctors wear. He ignores me completely which is the norm for the hospital, he pulls out of his pocket a tiny black IV bag, no writing on it, I've seen 5 patients get this before but it usually has a pink or other flesh colored cord ready to go with it. He goes to pull something else out, but apparently its not there, he looks at his watch nervously for a bit then apparently having reached some conclusion that I'm unaware of he grabs a clear IV line and sets it up. He thought i wouldn't pay attention like the other drones, that i wouldn't notice, oh Cthulhu take me I wish I hadn't looked. Because as it turns out, the bag wasn't black, the liquid inside was, I watched oh gods damn me I watched the whole bag empty into the man, watch his face drop silently as it formed an agonizing mask of silent pain, I immediately called the RN in, she looked worried before she saw the black bag, then she went still and blank, she informed me in a voice not all her own that it was ok, he was just having a nightmare, and that I could go home early, i wanted to ask why, but I already knew... just like all the others that got the black bag... Surgery... they always went under the knife after that, this time I sacked up and decided to follow my patient. I checked his number against the list of surgeries to be performed, apparently none... so i checked the room that was never used, or at least to my knowledge hadn't been used in 15 years, the operating theater.


The only problem with this with this whole plan, I now had to sneak past the other 4 operating rooms in that wing. I decided to grab a MMC baseball cap and a Transportation jacket and wheel an empty bed through hoping that everyone was too busy to notice me and that nobody needed a empty bed, that as it turned out was the least of my worries. The first thing that hit me was the smell, ever gut an animal? Been around someone who was in major surgery, that oozing smell, organs and blood. All of that magnified 10X is what i should have smelled, then i noticed, no people... and halfway through the hall it changed to this really really old hardwood floor, all of this put together made my skin crawl, so i decided to ditch the loud bed in one of the ORs, well when i opened the door I promptly threw up.


Inside waiting for me was a mound of flesh, a gigantic tumor of some kind, it had grown teeth and hair, eyes and fingers, it was surrounded by candles, and almost 25 IV lines running to it, and i recognized the fluid, blue, bright blue, only one thing like that in our hospital, Valium, enough to kill an elephant, but I thankfully didn't wait around to inspect any further having just lost my lunch all over the bed. I staggered into the operating theater in a haze, I don't know why I kept going, the thing in OR 3 was more evidence then needed to shut them down, yet I couldn't leave my patient without knowing what was going to happen to him.


Shortly after my entrance into the viewing seats I was ""rewarded"" with a slew of nurse drones setting up the rooms, more jet black bags right out of a freezer in the room, as they left an eerie quite came over the room, and what a room. Black walls and an old darkly stained hardwood floor dominated the room, and gods, the operating table, it was stone help me it was stone, the tools on the table they were from every age... then the doctors 
came in.

PTSD,"Mr. Dovah is back with some more goodies, this edition focus on some fun enhancements and enchantments to put on weapons and armor. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ringing Defense

Ringing Defense I Cl(5th) II Cl(10th) III Cl(15th)

Effect: Upon taking damage from a melee weapon this armor or shield property activates causing 1d6(+1 enhancement cost) 2d4(+2 enhancement cost) or 2d6(+3 enhancement cost) to the attacker. A successful fort save halves all damage from attacks this round. The DC save for this is 10+ the caster level of the enhancement, so DC15, DC20, and DC25 however if the weapon being used is solid metal (swords, but not an Axe) the fort save increases by +2. 

Fun: This is really just the sonic version of my Shocking defense, copy paste fun. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mithril Miners Pick

Description: The wooden handle on this pickax looks like it could use some replacing, however in stark contrast is the Mithril head which looks like its never touched stone. 

Ability(s): This +2 Mithril Pickax allows 3 uses of the Stone Shape Spell per day Cl(10th). Twice per day the owner may Detect gems at will as per the spell Locate Object, but this can only be used to locate gemstones.
 
Fun: Just thinking about the element earth and what I could build around it, I'm happy with this item, but I feel like it could come up with something more interesting. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Burglars Chalk

Description: This chalk comes in an Ironwood box, inside are typically ten pieces of chalk, each piece is in its own labeled slot and ranges in color from greenish to deep blue, a full piece of chalk has 20 uses.

Ability(s): When used on a substance other then the one labeled it writes and marks just like ordinary chalk, however when used on the listed material it has a violent reaction, starting to immediately eat through the material. On materials with 10 or less hardness one application eats through 6in of material in one round and then stops per use, on materials with 11 or more it takes 2d4 rounds and can eat through 1in of material and then stops per use. 

Fun: A full set of chalk with all uses intact would be very expensive and very illegal, for random finds I'd include 3-4 pieces, maybe one of mithril, wood, stone and iron, roll a d20+3 to determine how many uses each piece of chalk has with a maximum of 20 uses (if its not clear it means a chalk piece will never have less then 4 uses when found and never more then 20, so come on lucky 17).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wounding, Greater (+4) 

This enhancement functions as wounding except the amount of bleed damage caused is equal to the enchantment modifier on the weapon. (example, +4 Greater Wounding Katana would deal an extra 4 bleed damage on each strike.)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Festering (+2)

The weapon gains the ability to cause a random disease each round to the target based on a table and roll. Increasing the enhancement bonus to the weapon increases the DC of the save against the disease. The initial Ability damage is taken immediately after a failed save. A creature can be subject to no more then 2 diseases from this ability (this does not stop the creature from obtaining diseases in other fashions). 

Roll a 1d6 at the beginning of your turn to determine your disease for the turn.

1 / Zombie Rot DC 18

2 / Sleeping Sickness DC 14

3 / Rabies DC 14

4 / Dysentery DC 16

5 / Filth Fever DC 12

6 / Bubonic Plague DC 17


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immortal Armor

Description: This Bronze +2 Breastplate is in the style of the Romans, as such its basically a big manly bronze chest (nipples and all).

Ability(s): the wearer of this armor gains fast healing +3 as well as the ability once per week to use both Regeneration and Lesser Restoration as per the spell at Cl(15th), they need not both be used at the same time. 

Fun: I just really like the fact that its a Breastplate that has nipples and allows people to regrow arms. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Splitting (+1-5)

This weapon property is used for ammunition only. Each +1 spent on the Splintering weapon modification adds a smaller projectile that splits off mid flight, each of these projectiles deals an extra 3 flat damage. It follows, 

+1 / 3 damage and one miniature projectile

+2 / 6 damage and two miniature projectiles

+3 / 9 damage and three miniature projectiles

+4 / 12 damage and four miniature projectiles

+5 / 15 damage and five miniature projectiles

All edits are for clarity, readability and grammar",Mrdovah
PTSD,"Thought since my last post was so well received by the pathfinder community here I thought I would share some more of my fun little items. The first of these items is actually an enhancement that can be put on armor. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shocking Defense
Shocking Defense I Cl(5th) II Cl(10th) III Cl(15th)
Effect: Upon taking damage from a melee weapon this armor or shield property activates causing 1d6(+1 enhancement cost) 2d4(+2 enhancement cost) or 2d6(+3 enhancement cost) to the attacker. A successful fort save halves all damage from attacks this round. The DC save for this is 10+ the caster level of the enhancement, so DC15, DC20, and DC25 however if the weapon being used is solid metal (swords, but not an Axe) the fort save increases by +2. 
Required: Craft magic Armor, Shocking Grasp.
Side Note: I built this enchantment for a duelist I made specifically to wear down a the fighter in the party, she is massively powerful and in play tests this has helped wear down her character slowly enough to be considered balanced by me, so I made it available to my players. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thunder and Lighting 

These twin brass knuckles are made out of Adamantine and Mithral respectively. They add 1d6 Soinc or electric damage on unarmed attacks. Each of the weapons contains 3 charges per 3 days and can be recharged if left out during a thunderstorm.

“Thunder” Taking a standard action you can strike thunder against any hard surface (so sand doesn’t work) to stun creatures in a 15ft burst centered on the wielder. This ability uses 1 charge from Thunder, DC20 fort to not be stunned, success means that the creature is only deafened. 

“Lighting” As a full attack action the wielder may fire out as many ranged touch (max 100ft) attacks as her base attack bonus allows, the first deals 6d6 and subsequent bolts deal 1d6 less. If the target is wearing metal the wielder gets a +4 circumstance bonus to hit. This uses one charge from Lighting. 

“Bring the Boom” as a full round action the wielder can slam Thunder and Lighting together to make a single ranged touch attack using the same circumstance bonus from the “Lighting” ability. It deals 10d6 damage in a line to the target as well as the “Thunder” Effect to both the target and to those on 5ft on either side of the line. This uses 2 charges from both Thunder and Lighting.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fire Tamers Whip

Dmg(S) 1d2+1d6 fire / Dmg(M) 1d3+1d6 fire / x2

This whip once per week may as a standard action allow the use of Control Flames as per the power with a manifester level of 12. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bottled Tornado Cl(18th) 

Description: This small glass bottle has a picture of a crudely drawn tornado with a warning label with instructions on the back. The cork is firmly attached and when pulled off not much happens till the command words are spoken.

Ability(s): Command word: Ability

Trickle: Allows the user to breath out of the bottle for 30 rounds or 3 minuets so long as its held to its mouth.

Steady: Acts as a gust of wind spell for 5 rounds per day, these rounds do not have to be consecutive, but if they are it requires a standard action to hold the bottle steady on the target desired. 

Full Blast: Acts as a gust of wind spell, with one difference, the size of creatures affected moves up by two steps. 

WARNING: No not allow bottle or cork to cause or to be cracked or broken. Doing so will release the small piece of the elemental plain of air to exist in this material plain. (This causes a massive tornado to tear everything apart within thousands of feet, killing most things in moments [my thought was about 10d%+300])

Fun: Recently gave this bad boy to my players, cant wait to see what they come up with, I’m hoping something like strapping it onto a boat or to a smaller players back like a jet pack. ",Mrdovah
PTSD,"I'm running a homebrew campaign for my players and I write out sections of story every week while I'm at my job on little scraps of paper and put them all together in my GM Book (a leather bound journal that I suggest all GM's grab, after the campaign it gives you something to remember and look at, also good for reusing campaign ideas with new players.) But some weeks I just don’t have that much story to write(like when the players are in a dungeon and must pass a trial of riddles or solve chess puzzles while the others defend them, and you know that what you have written will suffice for 1 to 2 sessions.) On those days, Reginald Shoe(my old gnome Sorcerer and avid magical item craftsman) pays a visit to my little corner of Holden and drops off goodies for the players to find as loot. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gauntlet of Split personalities. Cl(5th)

Description: A leather glove with a face drawn on it.

Ability(s): Allows the player a second will save, must take the second result even if its worse. 

Fun: The glove often animates in and out of combat trying to kiss the player or assaulting the player with insults. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Of Health Cl(10th)

Description: A Mithral rod with Gold and Silver snakes intertwined around it.

Ability(s): Touching a creature at -1 or less hit points automatically stabilizes it.

Heal (100hp) Useable once per day

Cure Serious, Mass once per day outside of combat


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Never ending bag of Old Toby Cl(10th)

Description: A small brown tobacco pouch with a vine like cord holding the bag closed.

Ability(s): This bag contains 1oz of finely ground Old Toby Leaf, Smoking this leaf gives -2Int +2Wis for 1 hr per use, these bonuses and penalties can stack with multiple usages up to -8Int +8Wis, the bag contains enough Old Toby for 30 uses. The bag refreshes its supply every 7 days. 

Fun: The bag is a reference to Hobbit Leaf or Old Toby or as we on earth know it, Weed. I and some of my players like to smoke recreationally, and thus one day the item was born. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goggles of Future Sight Cl(12th)

Description: An adjustable Leather strap and Brass frames make up these seemingly mundane goggles.

Ability(s): These goggles allow the wearer to see roughly 2-3 seconds into the future and act accordingly, however this effect is very disorientating at first and often causes the wearer to vomit. This translates to a +4 bonus to Reflex saves as long as the wearer success in a DC 20 fortitude save first (this save decreases by 2 for every successful use in combat leading up to DC 0 meaning the wearer has become completely accustomed to the device.)

Fun: This item can be used to make a Player seem far more bad ass-ed then they really are in out of combat situations by catching things thrown at them from behind to great effect on their intimidate DC's. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APA-500 (aka Insta-Limb) (Cl 14th)

Description: Tiny red capsules that come in a very difficult to open jar.

Ability(s): Taking one of these pills acts as the Regenerate spell when taken orally.

Fun: Very simple and far more fun for players then scrolls, I gave my players 7 of these pills, the first one they ever took was to recover the Fighters lost eye(at the time they had no idea what they did), the bard then cut off a finger and took one, after it regrew they knew what they were and used them very sparingly. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bag of Breath Cl(12th)

Description: This every shifting and squirming bag shifts colors every few seconds in the most unsettling of ways, why anyone would open it and undo the chain around the top is a mystery. 

Ability(s): Once per day the bag will release the Breath of a randomly chosen adult dragon.

Fun: The bag has a secondary ability that is hidden from the players,  when used by a smart player Int 15 or more they can roll 4 times on the chart and pick from those rolls by predicting the pattern on the bag. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anymug Cl(15th)

Description: The mugs cup is made out of a green hallowed out crystal pillar, the handle is forged of adamantium and the rings attaching the two are gold, engraved with arcane symbols and inlaid with precious jewels. 

Ability(s): This mug while susceptible to heat hotter then boiling water and very vulnerable to acid is able to create any non-magical liquid in existence. This ability can be used at will. 

Fun:The secret to this mug is that if you place a potion inside of it, it will consume the potion. This allows the mug to make 6 copys of potion for the day, afterwhich the potions will louse their magic as well as mugs ability to make that potion, adding a fresh potion to the mug will allow it to mimic that potion for the day. These potions act at ½ the effect(must drink two potions to achieve effects like Enlarge Person.) of the original and become inert when a player tries to sell them. 
(Also, ya, a complete rip off of the Anymug in Goblins Comic, but with my own flavor)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Springheel Boots Cl(7th)

Description: Plain leather boots with a bit more heel in them then most men are comfortable with, however the heels hold springs enhanced by magic.

Ability(s): Allows the user to jump an extra 20ft weather its vertically or with a running start. 

Fun: My players have made great use of these boots even tho sometimes NPC's mistake the bard for a crossdresser.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pants of Ample Pockets Cl(9th)

Description: These brown pants look quite mundane from the outside, however some of the pockets are quite a bit deeper then one would think possible. 

Ability(s): The pants come with a minimum of one pocket that functions as a bag of holding, minor, however you can roll a d4 for the number of pockets that act in this way Max of 4 special pockets. 

Fun: These pants have been used to great comedic effect as well as allowing the players to think beyond, “Does it hit things? No! I don’t need it.”


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draconian Armor of Swift Girding Cl(7+AC Bonus)

Description: Armor befitting a dragon of standing, it can be made of numerous materials tho the most common is gilded steel. 

Ability(s): This armor jumps onto the dragon as a swift action when the command word is spoken and removes its self in a similar fashion. This also improves the Dragons tail attack damage by one step by adding a weapon to the end. The AC bonus varies. 

Fun: This was made for the Bards pet(?) silver dragon who was hurting a little when it came to AC (having only 19 AC while the average party member had 22+)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Necklace of Fake Personality Cl(4th)

Description: A beautiful crystal pendant is inlaid with gold and silver and hung from a silken string.

Ability(s): Gives the user +4 to all Cha based skill checks.

Fun:The story behind this one is that when I was first getting into Pathfinder someone described that Cha score was related to how personable and pretty you were, so I asked if I like garlic does that give me a penalty to Cha? Thus the joke was born that I used this trinket to combat my love of garlic frys and their damage to my breath.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod of Aquatic Mastery Cl(16th)

Description: This rod is made from a solid orb of opal whose cracks shift around always forming images of waves crashing against a golden beach. The shaft is made from silver and gilded shells form the grip of this beautiful rod.

Ability(s): Passive: Gives the owner gills when they enter water deep enough to swim in. Also allows the owner to detect the presence of water within 30ft of her current position. 

Move Action: This ability allows the owner to grow flippers, increasing her swim speed to 100ft for 6 rounds per day, they need not be consecutive.

Swift action: Three times per day the owner is able to cause a tendril of water to appear out of an appropriately sized pool of water, this tentacle has a 15ft reach and deals 1d6+4 damage to creatures it strikes, it must succeed in a ranged touch attack using the owners stats.

Full round Action: Once per day the owner of the rod can pull from any suitable source of water to encase a target in water, he may hold the water around the creature with a standard action, this effectively drowns the creature, DC 25 reflex to escape from the water. 

Fun: Recently introduced this rod in my game and cant wait to see how players use it in upcoming fights.

PTSD,"Some background information is required I think. I work as a security guard for a fairly well known company in Arizona. Currently I work for the company watching equipment. All equipment gets 24 hour watch, it's split into two shifts I like working the night because of how cool it is in Flag. The only issue is I have trauma induced Schizofrenia, this manifests itself primarily in hallucinations of both grotesque and disturbing nature, both visual and auditory.

The night is a perfect canvas is for hallucinations, and I'm at this point quite adapt at dealing with them... Or at least I thought I was.

Rewind to Sunday at 3am, I'm in my car as normal watching a movie on my iPad. When over the movie I hear a rustling from the bushes across the street in front of my car. I start going through the motions, focus my breathing and tell myself that I am the master of my mind. No sooner that I do this then something crawls out of the bushes and towards my car. It's head is down o I can't see it's face, just a tattered hood of a cloak which at first glance is red. (in flag there is a light pollution law of some kind, so it's so dark I can see the milky way, so my night vision is superb) as it starts to drag itself forward I cam see that it's missing fingers from it's hands and flesh from it's arms and I think that maybe its just a jogger that was attacked by a wild dog so I start to get out of my car, big fucking mistake.

It's head shoots up so fast it seems to break its neck, I can see it has no throat, just a bloody clump where it should be. Its head creaks down and I'm confronted with a mask that I'll never forget for the rest of my pathetic existence. It's wooden and smooth with two knotholes for eyes, the knotholes acting like bloody black holes drawing the very grain towards them. It makes no sound, makes no motion of poising itself, but still it flings itself a full 30 feet across the god damned street onto my car, it's broken hands slam into my window and it cracks, and worst of all the car rocks. This is when all semblance of self-control, my hallucinations are visual as in I can see them, they are auditory I can hear them. They are not, I repeat not, fucking tactile. My heart rate shoots up I start to panic hard.

My hand goes for the gun I keep on the passenger seat for extreme emergencies which my brain is telling me this is. It's gone, it's not in the seat because when I cleaned it last night I left it at the place I was staying because i thought I wouldn't need it in a sleepy suburb. So instead I grab my knife an sit there, dumbfounded as its head twists back and forth, them I notice it. It's reaching in through my open driver side window. I make a choice I slash at its hand and it moves it away and I bolt, out the car door down the street as fast as I can and I don't stop till I fall and can't get back up.

I check my phones GPS, I'm now 3.5 miles from my car. I make the hardest decision of my life and head back to my car. It's a long walk and my legs and lungs hurt, I'm very much so not used to this high altitude. When I get back there is no sign of the masked and mutilated man, but to my horror... My car window, has two big cracks in it where it landed, I spent the rest of my shift with my eyes glued to those bushes... I thought it was over, gods I wish I was right...

And I feel that its much too late, to have a sudden call to faith.
When will you love me? I want to know. Or will you hate me, and never let it show?

I have a question, do you even care? If I laugh and if I cry, you're never fucking there.

Where has my light gone and did it ever shine? You pissed on me and snuffed it out. Was it ever mine?

Yesterday morning I was standing outside to have a cigarette, while standing there I watch this really fast black ball seemingly come out of nowhere and go under the deck and behind an AC unit. A few moments later I watched the same ball move out from under the deck and around another AC unit. I searched and searched and couldn't find anything online.

I do smoke marijuana but I've never seen anything like that before while stoned also I wasn't even high. I've never had any kind of auditory or visual hallucinations in the past other than some tracers from magic mushrooms that I did years ago.

PTSD,"It's been nearly a year now since my life changed, its been one fucked up journey. Things have gotten a bit better but I do still have bad days, fortunately, they are fewer and further apart than they were in the beginning. The closer I get to the anniversary though the tougher my days are becoming. There was a point in time this year that I could close my eyes and not see and hear the accident, I desperately want to get back to that point. With the days counting down to November 16th I find myself being much more easily agitated, triggers that I thought I had overcome are now back, last night was the first night in 4 months that I had to sleep with the lights on. I can't give a good reason to why I've done this but I just spent all night reading the news articles and looking at the pictures from my accident, I'm so lucky to still be living and yet I feel as though a part of me died on that night last year.

Its not like my loved ones were exactly patient with me while I was going through the worst of it but, God Damn, give a guy some time to heal! It's been a little over a month since my last episode/attack and then today happened.

I can't stop feeling like one day something is going to happen and I'll lose it, that I'm going to snap and really hurt someone. This frightens me more than anything else, the flashbacks suck ass (that's just a fact of life now), the constant anxiety can suck a fuck, but the thing that has me absolutely terrified is the amount of anger/rage I feel. Its not always so bad that I fear losing control but its always there nagging and wanting to be set free. 

I'm in therapy but the guy only seems to want to focus on my anxiety and trying to get me to go out into the world. my therapist is being paid for by my workman's compensation insurance so I can't stop thinking that my therapist is only trying to get me to a ""good enough"" place and not actually help.

I feel so alone with all of this, I don't know what do to. I can't bring myself to actually tell anyone what I'm actually going through because it just hurts too much to talk about. So its always ""I'm fine"" or ""I just don't have anything to talk about"" or I'll just completely clam up and apologize for not talking because I was tired.

I laugh almost to the point of being manic at movies and tv shows but can't feel any kind of emotion. I take these spells where I see something and it reminds me of the accident then everything comes rushing back like a flashback, then I either start to cry like a little bitch or just stare blankly at the wall or ceiling for x amount of time. When I'm staring its like I can't move my body or even blink but I'm aware of my body and can feel it. I know this is really long and probably written line 5th grader but I had to get everything out so I was trying to do it as quickly as possible. I'm at a loss, I really don't know what to do until I'm able to get some sort of therapy, I've been smoking marijuana which seems to help but I can tell it doesn't bring me to 100% it basically just takes the edge off and allows me to relax for a few moment.

PTSD,"Hi everyone, 

I just discovered this sub. I am looking forward to interact with people that are going through the same thing, kinda, especially because people around me do not even know what PTSD is and assume it's only something war related. 

I was diagnosed last summer and at first I felt relieved knowing that my anxiety levels along with the nightmares and feeling unsafe constantly had a reason. Every time I got anxious I would tell myself that it was the PTSD and it helped. But after a while I stopped remembering myself that it was the PTSD. I would feel anxious and freak out even more because I tried to stop it but I couldn't. It affected my relationships, I slept really irregularly. I don't know how to explain, it's just like your mind is a blank page and someone goes over it aggressively with a pen. That is what I feel when I'm anxious. I freak out. I feel unsafe. The fact that I feel like I can talk about it with no one does not help either. I think that's why I feel invalidated at times. 

I am a 19 year old girl and at first glance nothing is wrong with me. My friends could not even imagine what it would be like to have such high levels of anxiety that you just feel your world crashing down or to get the same nightmare over and over again. When it comes to relationships I look for safety. If I get the feeling that the guy will hurt me eventually I just run. A lot of the times that feeling is totally irrational. But the fear is overwhelming. I can not risk getting hurt. 

I tried to talk about this with my counselor in college. She told me not to worry or be sad because I'm beautiful and stylish. Thank you Larissa but that is not what I needed. Since our conversation I just keep my feelings to myself. I am also kind of ""afraid"" to look good because I feel like people won't take my PTSD or depression seriously if I do. I feel stupid typing this but I feel like I will not get the help that I sometimes need or people will think that I'm exaggerating or have ""nothing to complain about"". Even my therapist does this. 

Along with all of this, I get triggered on the regular. My trauma stems from long term abuse that I suffered from my dad. My mother never stepped in or tried to stop him. He's out of our lives now, my dad, but I got a new abuser. My little brother literally threatened my life, burns my belonging and verbally abuses me daily. My mom does not step in once again. It is very hard for me to deal with this. My feeling just, it's too much. I try to protect myself, to give myself that feeling of safety but sometimes it's just too hard. 

I need to remind myself that all of those feelings are the PTSD and that there is nothing wrong with me. It really helps. 

I don't know where I was going with this. I just feel relieved being able to talk about this without feeling totally misunderstood or being afraid that people will see me as ""less than"", I don't know.

But now, almost a year later, we have classes together and see each other frequently. We text sometimes and he doesn't hate me anymore which I think is a sign that we are starting to become some type of friends again. He seems to want to hang out and told me about this girl that he likes.

PTSD,"Hi, 

I grew up in a family where my dad beat me and my mom never stood up for me. Where I was bullied in middle and high school and where my dad would call me names, gossip about me to the family and downright call me a problem. I am no longer in contact with him and I'm trying to build my sense of self worth. But now it is my little brother that is abusing me (threatened me with knife, burns my belongings) and my mom doesn't do anything. She also says horrible things about me and treats me like I'm not part of the family. I would say that I have come a long way mentally from where I used to be but I keep getting knocked down every time my family members do something shitty. 

So my LPT request is: how to I keep moving forward and not let all the craziness get to me too much. I am not in a position where I can move out yet and I'd like to be happy for once in my life.

PTSD,"I am speechless. I cannot believe that it has come to this. Yesterday, we were at a family gathering and my little brother went home to ""get something from the house"". He walked into my room and burned one of my bracelets instead. When I came home it was black and smelled like fire. I told my mom, she did nothing. I argued with her today that this is insane and that she should do something about this. That this is not normal and that I do not deserve this treatment from anyone. She says she will deal with this ""tomorrow"". It will have already been two days by then. Her plan is taking something he likes. This is not a joke. 

I know it was him because a) he's the only one that was home that day b) he hates me, tried to stab me in the past ( full story here http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3m45pa/my_little_brother_said_he_wished_my_dad_had/ and I'm so sorry to just drop the link, I'm on mobile and I really needed to share this. Also, she did nothing after this) c) he said that he ""didn't do it but that it would've been a great way to take revenge if he did.

I am making an escape plan. I was making progress regarding my mental health but now I just feel sad. It is *hard* for me to make progress and proceed with my escape plan when I keep getting shattered to the ground. It takes a lot of strength. 

Despite all of this I will remind myself that life is beautiful. That I don't deserve this, that I need to love myself. That there are so many beautiful moments ahead of me. That it is ok for my feelings to be there but that I don't have to hold on to them. That someone out there will love me and make me feel safe even though my own family did not. That I *need* to take care of myself whilst being kind to others. I am on my way of becoming the best version of me and no one is stopping me. 

At the same time, there's this fear. The fear that I can't do it. That I can't be a better person. Things like this make me feel so shitty that I start question myself entirely. I need it to stop so badly. I feel so alone.

PTSD,"I'm having a hard time writing about my Nfamily. There are just so many emotions put into these words and sometimes I can't manage to convert them to a coherent story. I apologize in advance. 

My little brother (12) is a troubled child. He has been sent away from three schools within 6 months and his current school for children with anger issues might send him away as well. He threatened to kill his classmate, fights constantly, makes hateful Facebook groups for teachers, you name it. My mom lets him do whatever he wants. He goes and stands wherever he wants, if she says no at first it only takes him some yelling and nagging to get what he wants, my mom lets him call her the most horrible curse words. She found out he was stealing from a local supermarket regularly and did NOTHING. 

I understood that my brothers behavior might come from our childhood (abusive alcoholic dad that was never there for him). I'm the SC and I've been through a lot with my dad. (I went NC in 2011, best thing that ever happened to me) He'd hit my siblings when they ""misbehaved"" and would be an unpleasant person at times but with me thinking he had heard me say a curse word while I was at the other side of the house would be enough to beat me senseless. He didn't care, he'd do it in front of my friend and wouldn't stop even if others and myself told him I hadn't said anything. Anyway, I understood the pain my little brother might be in and I tried to guide him. I didn't let him have his way, I didn't give in to his nagging and I sure as hell didn't let him curse me out without punishing him. (Punishing him would be a time out sitting on a chair, making him think about his behavior) Maybe it wasn't my place to ""raise"" him but I swear al I wanted was the best for my little brother and I saw that my mom didn't do what he needed so I tried to. He grew up to hate me because I was the only one that tried to correct his ways. (I also tried to get him therapy, it blew up in my face)

To make it worse, my mom undid every progress I had made with him. She told me that IM the problem of the family, that I'M the one that brought her the most trouble even though I never got into any. All I did was refuse to live how she wanted me to.

Anyway, this isn't about my mom. I could write books about her behavior as I'm sure most of us here can about our Nmoms. 

My little brother treats me horrible. He keeps calling me a piece of shit over and over again, screams at me constantly, calls me a worthless whore, tries to sabotage me at any opportunity he gets. He threatened to slice me open once because I was sleeping while he ran the doorbell. I had to hide in the bathroom and make sure the door stayed closed while he tried to stab me from under the door repeating the words ""open the fucking door"" and ""you're dead"". My mom did nothing. He treats me horribly. He tells me he wished my dad beat me to death, that I deserved the treatment I got from my dad. My mom still does nothing. She never even stood up for me when my dad was abusive. In fact, she recently has told me that she *understands* why he beat me. 

I had a good day today till I came home. I once again feel like I can't win.  My little brother can treat me horribly as much as he wants, he can even threaten my life and my mom will do nothing. I will always be the problem in her eyes. There's nothing I can do except for moving out (and trust me I will, I just need a plan). 

Please tell me I'm not crazy. I really need you guy's support at the moment. I'm angry and hurt, my anxiety level is at an all time high and I don't know how to deal. You guys are so amazing, I can't even put into words how much your subreddit has contributed to my personal growth. You all deserve the world. ",Malakaye
PTSD,"My mom said that during an argument. I was completely shocked. She had always known that he beat me up (over things like the wind smashing a door and even in front of friends) but had never done anything about except for telling me to stop crying afterwards. I didn't resent her for not jumping in because I understand that she didn't have an easy life either but her saying that she understands why he did it is horrible. Telling me that she understands why he dislikes me is horrible. I didn't know what to do after this so I just packed and went to Spain for 9 days. I had the best time of my life. No contact felt like heaven. I come back and I try to tell her how much her comment hurt and she gets all defensive telling me that it *never happened*. Fuck that. 

I'm getting out of here. 

Also guys, I feel so much pain and sometimes I can't help but still hold on to some hope that at least my mom will be a decent parent. Giving up hurts too much. I don't want to be fucked up. I don't want to have ptsd. I don't want to feel sorry for myself but this is just so consuming to me. How do you guys deal with the emotions? ",Malakaye
PTSD,"Both of my parents have told me that I'm ""arrogant"". I don't understand. First there was my dad telling me I was arrogant when I was just a child (younger than 10). He cussed me out saying that I'm worthless, ugly, a pig, nothing but trouble. He ""justified"" his behavior by stating that I'm arrogant. 

When my little sister and I were in our room he came in and would be mean to me and then turn to her and be like "" why are you so shy, I don't want you to have an inferiority complex. You are my baby girl"" and I stood there with tears in my eyes and said ""what about me?"" His response was that I'm an arrogant little shit. 

I DONT UNDERSTAND. How can I be arrogant when he makes me feel like I'm not even worth living? I was so incredibly insecure and depressed, I thought that I was a bad person, I thought that I was worth nothing and he goes and calls me ARROGANT. I was a child. I loved my dad and tried to do everything to make him like me. I didn't even know what being arrogant meant. I just thought that I was a horrible person. He looked for a reason to beat me up constantly and when there wasn't any he'd come up with one. He'd say that he had heard me say a cuss word and beat me up even thought I told him I didn't say anything, even if other people said I didn't curse. 

My dad isn't in my life anymore. I try to overcome everything that has happened to me. I try to make myself a better person, I try to have a sense of self-worth. It is incredibly hard but I'm trying and I have made progress. But today I feel like that little girl with tears in her eyes again. 

The better it has been going with my life, the more my mom has been calling me arrogant. She accuses me of thinking that I'm better than her and my siblings. She knows that I struggle with depression and self-worth. She knows that I'm incredibly insecure. I still have days where I wonder whether I'm worth living. She doesn't understand how hurtful those words are to me. It's breaking my heart. It's dragging me down while I've been fighting so damn hard to get myself up. I asked her why she thinks I'm arrogant and she says ""I don't know, the way you talk."" So I ask if she can be specific and all she can say is that she doesn't know and that its a feeling. She also says things like ""Malakeye isn't a good example, don't follow her example"" to my other siblings when she knows that I can hear it. She calls me retarted, a witch and said that she understands why my dad beat me up.

I have ptsd, she never asks me how I'm doing. When I went on a trip by myself (in another country) for 9 days she didn't call me, when my dad used to beat me up she would never stop him or make me feel better about it. But the worst thing she could ever do to me is telling me that I'm arrogant. It just brings back so much memories. It makes me wonder what I've done wrong, I feel like a bad person again and my self-worth is dropping to an all time low. I used to have nightmares, horrible nightmares because I felt like a bad person and I thought that I was going to get punished. The fear, everything is coming back again and I don't understand why she's doing this to me. 

Yesterday I came home and called out for my mom. My sister said that she was praying and made a joke about my mom praying for us that we'd turn out alright and I said (to my sister, as a joke) yeah, she's praying for you. My mom got super pissed off at me for it, saying that I'm a mean person, made her feel bad and whatnot. I tell her that it wasn't even directed at her and that she says hurtful things to me all the time. She asks for an example and I say ""you call me retarted a lot"" and she goes ""that's because you are"". I feel like I can't win. Both coming up for myself and saying nothing makes me feel horrible. I told her today that she makes me feel really bad about myself by saying that I'm arrogant and she didn't seem to care. Everything is always my fault. ",Malakaye
PTSD,"I have been in and out of depression since I was a child. I can remember my dad finding a poem that I wrote about darkness and slipping into the unknown when I was only 10. He went off to me about it, screaming, stating that it was making him 'depressed'. I didn't tell him that he was the reason I wrote that poem. The name calling he did, calling me a nerd/pig/worthless, stating that I was only going to bring him trouble even though I was only a child and honestly did my best to please him. Beating me up when the door slammed due to the wind (I told him it was the wind but he wouldn't stop) or when he thought that I said a bad word that I definitely hadn't said. I wasn't allowed to cry. It all made me wonder what I had done to deserve that treatment from my dad. Was I a bad person? Did I deserve all this?? was he right?! It made me feel so small and unworthy, I wrote the poem to relieve some of the bad feelings that were eating away at me. 

My heart is breaking all over again just typing this. It has such great affect on my confidence and self-worth. I really don't want to blame my parents if I don't have to and I really want to be the strong person that enjoys life to the fullest but it is just *so* hard when your parents haven't shown you any love or respect. Even though I know that it's not my fault I still find myself wondering I'm a bad person. I still cry my eyes out when I think bad to those times while the pain eats away at me. 

I haven't told the story of my mom yet but I don't really want to either. She has her own problems and isn't emotional available for me. She tells me that I'm a witch, doesn't call me when I travel, never tells me that she loves me. I need her. I've told her. But she still isn't there for me. I haven't seen my dad in years and I keep getting suggestions from people telling me to reach out to him. To me, the stress and pain that comes with confronting my biggest demon isn't worth a relationship with my father, I don't owe him shit. My life is much better without him and from what I hear he hasn't changed (he gossips about me to the family telling them that I'm a slut basically, burned my picture, cursed me multiple times) so fuck all people using the fact that he's my father as a reason to reconnect with him. 

I'm sorry if this post is incoherent, my feelings are all over the place and I still get extremely upset recalling this. Basically, I am done with the emotional damage I got from my childhood. I'm 19 years old now, about to go into adult life and I want to be a well-functioning member of society. I don't want to feel like the little girl that felt unworthy, insecure, unloved, disrespected, invisible ect anymore. I want to move on from that and start my own life. I want to be confident, motivated, have self respect and confidence. I have so much love to give. I understand pain. It is just so hard.

Honestly I don't know if I can mentally handle holding a job but I'm trying to get something, anything. I can't stop myself from noticeably trembling during interviews, really who would hire someone like that, I guess I don't blame them. Just feeling like giving up on it lately, not sure what to do at this point. Everything feels like too much but I need to be doing something. ",randy_buttcheese
PTSD,"A couple days ago I learned that my brother molested my older sister too. For all of my life I thought it was just me and I had convinced myself that he was just going through a phase, that he wouldn't hurt others. My sister and I opened up about things together, and we believe she was the first victim starting around age 12 or so (placing him at about 14) and myself was 8 years old when the abuse occurred. Either he was abusing us around the same time or we're both a little fuzzy on some of the time line of events here. From what we both described his behavior seemed to escalate with me and that my older sister must have been his starting point.

I feel so fucking lost now, and I know something HAS to be done about it, I just don't know where to start. In all of my life I had imagined he must have felt bad, that he probably stopped doing those things, but after talking to my sister it sounds more like a pattern where he was evolving into something worse. Some fucked up part of me feels guilty if I destroy his life, and I feel like us opening up to our parents is going to ruin our family forever. 

For a little backstory here, I know that my mother has suffered tremendous abuse from her childhood. Her mother had schizophrenia and her step father was a rapist, among many many other things. She clings to my overly controlling father and has no idea about any of this. I feel like she cannot mentally handle anymore things like this, she thinks she has escaped the cycle of abuse, and our older brother has always been their 'golden child'. 

After I was diagnosed with PTSD last year, (thanks to my asshat brother) my parents kept trying to nose into my business and they both suspect correctly that it's from some kind of sexual abuse, they don't know when it happened or who. It sucks because I feel as if I have built up this thick wall from myself and my mother, I miss her dearly, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this secret for.

It also makes me feel sick when I start to wonder if my brother has evolved to hurt others. I've wanted to confront him about it but every time I try to speak with him online I get too much anxiety and chicken out. I also have a theory that I really, REALLY hope I am wrong about. 

Given the nature of how abuse is learned and goes in cycles, I've wondered where my own brother learned his abuse from. I know that my Uncle on my dad's side of the family is a rapist, and statistics show that rapists start their abuse in the home. I believe that my Uncle likely did things to my father, and that in turn my father may have been the one to abuse my brother. My father has extreme control issues and has always treated my older brother in a way that is different from the rest of my siblings. I have always seen my brother angrily lash out at my dad and speak ill of him. Something just feels weird there, and without me even bringing it up to my sister, she even brought up weird things about our father in regards to our brother. 

I have no evidence for my theory, I could be biased, I have a lot of issues with my dad and I get easily paranoid too. I know that it would be the right thing to take responsibility and somehow make sure my brother is not hurting anyone else. I just don't know if I should open up to my parents, if I should try confronting my brother at all. A really dumb part of me still tries to say that he probably stopped this shit and that I'd be ruining my brother's life if I went to the police. 

tl;dr – My brother molested me and my sister when we were kids, what I thought was a phase appears to be he was evolving his method, not sure what I should do now.",randy_buttcheese
PTSD,"I can't hear any npc dialogue and at first some of the subtitles kind of worked but then some would flash by so fast that there was no time to read it. I uninstalled and reinstalled SKSE and problem only became worse where now the text for the dialogue is nonexistent! Even during a cutscene the dialogue no longer works. 

I've checked if any of my mods are causing the issue and they made no difference. I haven't tried uninstalling skyrim itself and reinstalling that.

When trying to research this issue online I did see one thing people mentioned, and that many had this issue if they had a realtek soundcard and it turns out my laptop does have this. I've tried all of the fixes suggested there and that also did nothing to change the issue. I just don't know what to do about it anymore aside from uninstalling and reinstalling skyrim itself. 

edit: Okay so I was a dumbass about not checking if my reinstall of SKSE reset the options for subtitles, so now I see the dialogue text again but it's still the same issue as prior where it runs through the text so fast I can't read it, and the audio itself is nonexistent. ",randy_buttcheese
PTSD,"I wasn't one of those who was ever factual minded. Having been born and raised into mormonism I was told the church would do the thinking for me. I was taught since birth that I should follow the prophet and raised to be fearful of asking the wrong questions. For me it was emotional reasoning where I was having doubts in a god at all. I had experienced abuse as a child and was angry that god didn't help me when I needed him most, and then I came to the conclusion that there simply was no god at all. How insulting it was to sit in church and be fed the idea that god would help you when you needed him most. Eventually my anger turned to curiosity about the history of the church which they try to make you very afraid of doing, and I was appalled at the truth I had learned. Since then I have been trying to think critically and logically instead of basing decisions purely on emotions.

So that's my story, I'm curious to hear about yours. Was it science and facts that brought you to your conclusion or was it emotional reasoning for you? ",randy_buttcheese
PTSD,"I just wanted to share my story on here from the perspective of someone who has been the instigator of a dead bedroom, and overcoming it with my husband.

When we were dating we were wild and adventurous, sneaking out to public places at night and fucking like carnal animals, it was amazing and exhilarating. Then we got married and I just shut down big time. It was like the instant the ring went on my finger, my drive for sex became non existent. Every time that I rejected him I felt guilt hit me, like I was supposed to say yes even though I really was uninterested to engage in sex. That guilt built up over the course of a few months until I decided to have sex with him even if I wasn't in the mood whatsoever, I didn't want it to be unfair to him. He was not pressuring me into it, but I felt like I was not fulfilling my purpose as a wife and woman. 

Then we had sex over the next year and I was not only uninterested in it, I experienced sharp pain and developed a self loathing sensation to put out when I did not want to. It reached a point where it put me into so much emotional pain that I started crying myself to sleep because I was hurting myself when trying to appease my husband, and I knew he would feel guilty had I told him it was making me feel this way.

I was frustrated with myself, I hated myself and couldn't fathom why my SO bothered to put up with me. It was extremely unhealthy, but I continued to withhold my emotions on this until I just fucking broke down and couldn't do it anymore. I was trying to fake being into it but I started sobbing on his chest and he stopped and just held me.

I don't know why I was so surprised he was more worried about me than the sex itself. It was that moment though that I realized I needed to see someone and get help. We stopped having sex again, and it was shortly after that I then became physically ill for the course of a full year.

I was in daily agony and couldn't stand upright, my stomach felt like it was being shanked every time I moved and I was just absolutely sick to my stomach. Kept going to the doctors and they did all kinds of tests, didn't find anything wrong, until I switched to a new doctor and she presses down on my chest and feels how tense it is, then is very adamant that my illness is being caused by anxiety and that I need to see someone about it.

I finally began therapy and was diagnosed with PTSD due to being molested as a child. With my upbringing as a mormon, I was raised to believe my only value as a woman was to be a good wife and please your husband. I was taught to be ashamed of my body in so many ways and already felt defective because I was tainted. For a long time those issues were buried down very deep and I tried to ignore them, I just wanted to move on with my life, but the trauma and pain caught up with me.

I had become terrified of sex and the idea of giving up control to my husband, and realized that my rejecting him in the beginning was a subconscious attempt at feeling in control of my sexuality. This year as my physical symptoms have gone down tremendously, and as I have been accepting what happened and challenging my thinking, I have also begun to reclaim my sex drive and life of intimacy with my husband.

I have finally been desiring sex again and enjoying it without any pain. Reclaiming control of my sex life has been empowering for me in so many ways. I still feel awful for making my husband wait so long but I am so grateful for his patience and loving kindness. I've found healthier ways of being in control ;) such as being the one on top and have lately been the one initiating!

It was one of the most difficult things I've ever done and I'm terrified if he will share it with the family or accuse me of making it up, though I really don't think he would do either of those things.

PTSD,"Hello TwoX, I've been having a mental dilemma for a long time now and could use some insights here. While I could have posted this in [r/ptsd](http://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd) I felt I would get more feedback here. I have PTSD because I was molested by my oldest brother as a child over the course of two years. I've never told anyone in the family except for my youngest sister recently, who has been amazingly supportive of me. I've been going to therapy to try and find healthier ways of coping, and to help find the closure I need to heal and move on in my life from the past that still hurts me. Some part of me feels like I will never find that closure until I tell my mother. 

She knows I have PTSD now but I haven't told her why. I'm sure she suspects its sexually related......because recently out of the blue she dropped it on me that her step father was sexually abusive to her. There's a few reasons why I hold back from telling my mother. My first and biggest reason here is that I've always felt like a burden to her, because I know that she had such a horrible upbringing. She never calls me a burden, in fact she works so hard to take care of me and my siblings, in fact she's always shown nothing but love and kindness to me, I just...carry this heavy guilt that me adding problems on is just continuing the sea of shit she's been trapped in for so long. 

I can tell my mother hasn't healed from most of the abuse in her childhood, she just survives. I'm worried that telling her will only add to her hurt. I've already decided I never want to tell her who molested me, I don't want her to know because of a different reason entirely. It's kind of fucked up but I don't want anything to happen to my brother even though he deserves punishment, I feel like he did what he did because he was fucked up at the time and it was his way of lashing out. He stopped at a certain point in time and to my knowledge has never done anything to other women, god I hope he hasn't. I guess I'm just terrified that 1. opening up to my mom will hurt her, and 2. I don't know how to bring it up to her without revealing who did this to me. 

I tried to tell her today, and the day before that. Everytime I tell myself I'm going to open up to her about it, my anxiety gets to be too much where it brings out physical symptoms and I feel ill.

PTSD,"I think I've posted this before, but my PTSD isn't related to a single event, or rather that is to say that I probably had it from childhood trauma already and then I joined the military and then a couple of other things happened.  So the things that set me off might be related to one of the childhood events, or it might be deployment related, or it might be a non-military event that still happened in adulthood.  But because I have this lovely cocktail of shit in my past, it's really hard to find anyone who can relate.  Therapists tend to just sit there wide-eyed when I start going into all of the things.  Other people with military experience tend to play the one up game with ptsd stuff, or insist that my case can't be as bad as it is because I wasn't wading through bodies  (which in all fairness it probably wouldn't be if I hadn't had issues from childhood).  


So anyway, I was just watching a stupid TV show and there was a scene where one of the characters woke up covered in blood.  One of those ""other adulthood"" events of mine has to do with bleeding out unexpectedly in a hospital and being resuscitated and transfused.  So it didn't go over too well for me.  For a minute I had this urge to call family, or my SO, or a friend and just vent about it.  But I realized that what I was looking for was an understanding that I won't get.  I don't want someone to tell me that I shouldn't be so upset because they've been through worse, nor do I want someone to say how sorry they are for me.  What I really wish is that I knew someone else who could go ""oh yeah, I hate that scene too, isn't it stupid that stuff like this can take you back 5 years whether you want to go there or not?""  


To me PTSD has become the bad punchline to my life, and sometimes I just wish I knew someone I could relate to about my particular flavor of it.



It's like I can say, ""man I'm really depressed today"" and somebody in the mix will ask why and follow it up with how life is crazy and sometimes they've struggled with the same thoughts too.


But if I say, ""man my PTSD is out of control right now"" someone will claim there's is waaaay worse and somebody else will tell me how sorry they are that my brain is broken....",Taliaban
PTSD,"I was diagnosed with C-PTSD about 2 years ago, by which point things had gotten so bad that I was no longer sleeping.  I would go days and days so on edge I couldn't fall asleep, I would hallucinate due to the lack of sleep, on the occasions that I would fall asleep I would have night terrors, sleep walk, and often wake up in the middle of acting out a PTS related nightmare.  I was in hell.  I voluntarily sought in patient care just to get my medications balanced enough that I could sleep.  At my worst I was having to down 13 pills before bed.  But the last 7 months I've really managed to take control of things.

I've weaned myself off the majority of my meds, and the only one I've had to go back to is a fairly low dose of Prozac.  I can live with that.  I still have bad days from time to time but I have a wonderful partner who supports me through it.  I just realized tonight how happy I've become and how okay everything is now.

Nobody else noticed that I was in an off mood because I'm used to keeping things professional.

PTSD,"I'm just wondering if anyone else was ever punished for throwing up?  When I was about 10 emom decided that I had the magical ability to vomit at will.  I remember a couple of occasions that seem contradictory to what I would do for my own child.

The first one I had been sick with the flu for awhile and was laying on the couch sleeping with a trashcan next to me when I was about 9.  Emom came over and started eating burnt toast by my head and I asked her to move because the smell was making me feel ill, I got told I was full of shit and to stop whining for attention.  Then I had to take the trashcan I filled with vomit down the street to the dumpster because according to my Nfamily I had thrown up on purpose because my mom told me ""no"" when all I had asked was for her to not sit over me with food...



The 2nd time I was about 10, and I said I didn't feel good, I was groaning and rocking with my arms over my stomach trying not to throw up because I felt like if I moved it was going to come.  I asked for a trash bag and was just told to go outside so I was trying to get my stomach to settle enough to make it to the door.  Well I didn't make it and ended up throwing up on my sisters toy.  Then I was screamed at and punished for days for making myself throw up on her toys.....  I was 10 and had a stomach bug..

PTSD,"I was 22 years old, had just had a baby the father of whom wasn't helping at all at the time.  Ndad wanted us all to travel across country and spend the holidays together to meet Nstepmom.

I made it clear before I came that I didn't have a lot of money that year having just become a single mom a few months prior, so I would buy my own plane tickets, rental car etc. But only the children  (as in people under 18 who were going to be there) would be getting presents from me.   


So we get done opening presents and I go to take some stuff out to my car but NDad follows me.  He pulls me aside and says ""I was just wondering where my present was, I noticed I didn't get anything from you?""  So I explained that babbydaddy and I had broken up because I caught him cheating while I was pregnant, I was still waiting on my child support case, and in the meantime had to provide everything for my daughter by myself and we just didn't have a lot.  So he says ""Well I thought you were getting a 2k bonus from your job this year?  How much of that will you be able to give me?""  (He always insisted I owed him money for the expense of raising me, even though I have been independent and on my own since I was 16).

I'm trying my best to stay grounded but right now stuff is just pissing me off.  First of all my sister lives with me but has gotten into a really messed up relationship, so she called our brother crying the other day because of some shit this guy did.  So my brother told her that instead of putting up with this guy's abuse she should just leave and come crash at my house, where she technically lives so it's not like it is a problem for me.  Do you know what her excuse was?  She said she couldn't come home because it was late and if she came banging through the door I might pull a gun on her or something, you know, because of my ptsd.  So apparently my ptsd which has never hurt anyone else, is the reason she has to stay and get her ass beat or whatever.  It feels great that my fucking illness is now an excuse for my family members to make poor decisions.

Also, I hate people in general anyway because half of the time if I get close enough to someone to explain why I'm in therapy and take 12 pills a day so I don't come totally unglued, they always act like it's a goddamned right to probe into your ptsd.  Like they're more of a doctor than your goddamned diagnosing headshrink, so clearly if joe schmo disagrees with your diagnosis you're just a hypochondriac.  I feel like if I just lied and said I have bipolar or schizophrenia or fucking lupus I would get less bullshit.  It's like people think ptsd is a fashion statement or something, so they need to ""evaluate"" whether you really deserve to have such a label.

PTSD,"So yesterday, new years day, I wake up to a bunch of calls and texts from NSis complaining that her car won't start and asking if I'll bring my battery charger to her boyfriend's house.  Now, it was early, my day off, and the roads were completely iced over with travel warnings and the whole bit.  Plus she added to her text that I could come by whenever and ""no hurry"" since she had the day off also.  So I figured I'd relax for a bit, and wait for the ice to melt so it'd be safer to drive, and I told her as much.


Well less than an hour later she tells me that her boyfriend is getting called in to work, so she's going with him to get more hours herself, and their boss is going to drive them.  So she asks if I can come by later in the day to help with her car.  I don't get out very much and had already scheduled a babysitter for later on so I could have a date night with my boyfriend and a break from my kids.  So I just told her that it would depend on what time it was because I had plans later on in the night.


So naturally she starts bombarding my phone at like 9pm when I'm out on my date and leaves me this really hostile voicemail demanding that I come help with her car even though I was out because she ""had to work all day"" and is ""sorry"" my plans don't fit into her schedule.  The whole thing was just so entitled and nasty, she was talking like I had done something to wrong her by not answering my phone and leaving my date to help her.  So my boyfriend convinced me to just ignore her and enjoy our time together.

By the time I got home my phone was flooded with messages.  I finally responded to her at about 1am and she seriously demanded that I come bring her my charger right then because even though she got a jump her battery won't stay charged in the cold weather.  I told her no because the kids were asleep and I'd already sent the sitter home.  Now she's throwing a fit because I don't want to drive anywhere today because it's again raining ice and they don't salt or clear the roads here at all.


So now I'm trying to figure out how she's angry at me and I feel like the bad guy here? when literally the only thing I did yesterday was what I had been planning on doing for a week, relax at home on my day off and go out with my SO. ",Taliaban
PTSD,"I've recently started experiencing periods of blindness in my left eye that come and go, I've recently moved and haven't gotten in with a new neuro yet but I know vision problems are common. However about 2 weeks before the vision problems started I had about a week where I just couldn't hear right with my left ear, high pitched sounds were extremely loud and high pitched to me, hearing a baby cry hurt, but lower sounds were muffled like I was under water.  I thought it was just a sinus/inner ear issue, I went to the clinic but they couldn't find an infection or anything so they just gave me Sudafed which didn't help, but it just went away on it's own after about a week.

I started gabapentin to help with some of the symptoms which has been great.  I've had about a month of feeling normal.  Then the other day I woke up and couldn't see out of my left eye.  Today my vision is back but there's new spasms and pain in my right leg that hurt worse than anything else yet.  I can barely walk.

This rings true with my own experiences with my ndad, first trying to show up in the delivery room (yuck), then acting like he had just as much right to my child as I do, which finally escalated to his making false claims to cps to try and have my child taken from me claiming it would be ""for the best"" since I can't handle the ""work"" of my own child.  It's like they simultaneously hate children but feel they know better than any other parent anyway.

I've been noticing the same thing with my nsis, she's always making comments like ""imagine how great your life would be with no kids"" and talking about how she'll never have any because it's just a lot of work for no reason.

I honestly just can't even wrap my mind around this thought process.  I love my child more than life.  To me the best feeling in the world is when she is showing off something she learned at school, or when she wants to just cuddle and talk to me about whatever comes into her mind.  To me she's the best part of my life, I feel such love and pride in every part of her.  I  wouldn't trade the experience of motherhood for anything.  It never feels like ""work"" to me, even if we're going through a rough patch in her development I know we'll get through it and I get the privilege of watching my sweet little baby grow into a great young lady.

But yesterday she did some cleaning up, said she was applying to jobs, and apologized for putting me in the situation with Ndad.  PROGESS!  So I thought maybe all hope is not lost for her yet.

Right now we're staying on a military base and she doesn't have the appropriate ID to go to the shops or get through the front gate.  She knows this.  So this morning she asked if I would take her to the comissary so she could buy her own groceries. Yay! Except that I woke up with the stomach flu and even getting out of bed sucks.

So, she decides to go off post anyway, then a few hours later she texts that she needs me to come let her on base ""right now.""  So I said no, I don't feel good.

So she calls me crying because her groceries will go bad if she has to wait until I can stand without projectile vomiting everywhere.  I just told her oh well, I didn't want to have to move at all today but I will try to keep some fluids down and once I can do that I will come get her.  So she gets this super bitchy tone with me and starts yelling about how everything is someone else's fault blah blah blah before hanging up on me because I won't go get her right now.

PTSD,"So my youngest sister recently graduated high school and I offered to let her stay with me for a few months so she could get on her feet and get established as an adult without ndad dictating everything.  I've been NC with ndad for years and would like to keep it that way.

Now I'm not sure yet if my sister just has bad fleas or is a full on narcissist, but there's been a lot of surprises.

1. She says she wants to be a contributing member of my household, yet expects everyone to literally pick up her trash, and pay for everything she needs.  If confronted by it she throws out the ""you just hate me, I'm such a f*** up, I wanna die"" crap but doesn't actually change her behavior.

2.  She lies to everyone, all the time, about everything.  She got a job a couple months ago but wasn't working enough hours to support herself at all, so she was still living off my groceries and whatnot but I realized that my grocery bill had literally tripled since she moved in.  I guess she eats more than me and my kids combined or just wastes stuff or something.  Either way it was too much so I told her that I couldn't afford to keep doing it and that she needed to try and pick up enough shifts to at least be able to buy her own food.  So she was gone all hours of the day saying she was at work getting all these hours, yet this paycheck still only had about 12 hours of work for a 2 week period.  When I confronted her about this she claimed that the corporate office messed up everyone's checks (It's a huge chain company so yeah right).  So of course she's still helping herself to the pantry knowing I can't afford to keep supporting her to this extent.

3.  Then the big one came today.  I'm NC with my ndad and would like to keep it that way.  But he emailed me yesterday asking about a bunch of stuff she had been telling him that I was going to do with/for her to come home for the holidays etc.  It was all some huge lie she'd been telling him.  I'm not interested in getting thrown under the bus nor involved with any of these people at this point so I actually responded only to say that I had not said any of those things and that if she's coming home to visit it's not with me.

So, now they're both trying to get me all involved in their drama and I don't want to have to go NC with my sister too, but I don't know what to do since I haven't been successful in getting my sister to stop the things she's doing and they both are trying to put me in the middle now.",Taliaban

PTSD,"Has anyone else gotten people inaccurately concluding that you have aspergers when you are under extreme stress? My personality is naturally stoic (I don't show pain easily, there's a lot of emotion under there (definitely a lot of empathy for others) but it doesn't naturally show unless I make a point of revealing it), logical and calm. I also don't always have that much interest naturally in social games, sugarcoating (and on occasion I dislike small talk) though I do put in the effort at these. I find that with the stress of PTSD a lot of my sugarcoating fell/falls by the wayside. I wasn't able to keep up as well with these things as well. I also started to feel a lot of shame and I largely stopped making eye contact with people. I knew it was unlike me and actually felt really embarrassed about that. (I would compare it to being depressed and unable to wash your hair and having people assume that you just don't know to wash your hair or don't know you should wash your hair when in fact you do know to wash your hair and in fact you feel very embarrassed about your unwashed hair and the fact that you just don't have the energy to wash it). 

Because I was grappling with this feeling of betrayal and hopelessness about ever connecting with people and not having them then betray me I also felt like I was at my wits' end with people. I don't know if I should say that I did not want to connect with people but I was definitely avoiding a lot of connection for fear of being betrayed again. I was not glossing over things like I normally did and was not adding all the social niceties and normal politeness because partly I was hurting so much that I didn't have the motivation to do that. 

This led some people  to assume that I had aspergers disorder, instead of seeing that I was really out of it with the PTSD. I was under so much stress and that's why I was acting that way meanwhile people were assuming that the effects of the stress were a natural characteristic of me instead of seeing them for what they were. I mean certain things I can do with my eyes closed, no matter how ill or stressed out I am because I am good at them (like logic and deep thinking), other things where I am not naturally talented at them, those things fall apart more easily when I'm under a lot of stress, in the same way that other people might find the first place their stress shows is with them failing courses for me it's harder to fake with people, negotiate interpersonal situations and get people to do what I want and that's one of the things to go. It doesn't help of course that I'm a woman and being more stoic/calm and logical as a woman is not expected (it is gender non conforming), so people I suppose find my gender non conformity in that sense a bit difficult to interpret and jump to the aspergers' conclusion. Has anyone felt the same ?

PS I think one way to tell the difference between people with aspergers and those with post traumatic stress is that people with aspergers seem a lot more agreeable. They generally seem to want to learn the right rules to follow and put great effort into following the rules whereas those with PTSD may not want to follow the rules because that means risking emotional connection and subsequent betrayal again.

Then I feel like I'm trying to avoid my feelings because I know that other people want to avoid them too and I feel like it's making it worse.

I know that true recovery would look like my bravery in surviving being acknowledged and celebrated even when I no longer have any symptoms. I know that even if I were to recover some people would not want to acknowledge my bravery in surviving, but they would be glad that I was ""functional"" because it's less of a problem for them. Then there would be some people who would acknowledge my bravery in surviving even though they ""didn't have to"". It's not getting rid of any symptoms for them or doing anything to improve their life, in fact it's costing them something to say that to me. It would just be something they would do and I would know that I could trust them in a way. ",lovinglily
PTSD,I was having a thoroughly horrible day yesterday (in a thoroughly horrible month where I am being harassed by a certain family member) and I was having a flashback last night. I was talking to my friend and she and I were both unhappy. I started talking about this particular topic and I could tell that she thought I was informed about it (I am informed) and my flashback stopped. I think that in short what stopped my flashback was feeling her respect. I felt connected to her and that she valued her connection with me.,lovinglily
PTSD,"I am hurting. I was betrayed by my closest friend and ended up being abused because of it. Then while I was being abused and was unable to extract myself from the abuse many people judged me as lazy or not trying hard enough. I had people slam doors in my face (literally). That hurt. During that time I was waking up in the morning feeling like putting a gun to my head and I would calm myself down by telling myself, ""This is just post traumatic stress... many people feel this way. It doesn't mean I should actually act on it, it's OK to have the feeling and not act on it."" Meanwhile people were treating me like I was lazy and slamming doors in my face. Then finally they figure out that they misjudged you and they want it go back to normal now and they will treat you like you are normal or something, but it still hurts. I don't know how to classify their sorry. I guess they figured out they evaluated wrong and that's good that they were at least able to get to that point. I paid all the cost of their misjudgement and they are content for me to have paid all the cost and to keep paying it. They are ""sorry"" but really it's no skin off of their back, I've been the one to incur all the losses, what did they incur and what does their sorry mean ? What sacrifices are they making and does it come anything close to the price that I've paid? And I still feel like if I were in the same position again for some reason they would still be misjudging me. It feels hollow. It still hurts. I don't trust people who expect me to absorb all the losses. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I'm feeling heartbroken. I've had severe PTSD for many years, it's gotten better to some extent for a few years. 99% of people have no empathy for what I'm going through and I get misjudged, blamed and rejected a lot. When I was doing better, more people were accepting. Some of them then wanted to be ""friends"" and pretend like everything was good, people who had never been there for me before. The question for me then was should I forgive people who were hurtful to me and unaccepting before.  Now unfortunately in spite of my very best efforts my PTSD has been reinvigorated again. A lot of people are now rejecting and judgemental again. It hurts. This is not something that I had or have control over. I tried so hard to not have this flare up again and now it has. I think I see some people's motivations more in this situation and I don't like what I am seeing. I am particularly heartbroken at being misjudged, people act like I'm trying to be like this or I just need some tough love or someone to set down the boundaries. Can't they see that I was attacked again and again and again ? Also people do not care about the years of my life that I've lost while I was struggling to hold it together and doing everything in my power to try to recover. To them it's just like, ""You're one of those people doesn't have family support and who takes longer to get things."" On the other hand someone else said to me a while ago, ""It's our loss that we've lost your contributions over these years that you've been unable to contribute"" and that was healing to me, I believed them and that was what I needed to hear to know that they really cared. 

The thing is that even if I did hypothetically get better again, and people start being ""nice"" again out of wanting my usefulness to them will I then blindly ""trust"" all these selfish people ? Will I then ""forgive"" them and forget about their motivations ? That would feel like a betrayal to myself, how will I deal with that ? I feel a bit like I betrayed myself in the past by trusting some of these people who had never been there for me before in the bad times but suddenly wanted to be there in the good, in particular one of my aunts.

PTSD,"I heard someone talk about dropping the D on PTSD and I decided that I'm doing the same thing. I'm finished with calling myself disordered. As far as I can see shame is at the root of so much of this disorder and calling myself disordered is only adding to the shame and making it more difficult for me to solve. I remember having an aha moment a while ago that my PTSD symptoms were like battlescars, something that should be a point of pride of my strength and courage in having survived awful things, not something to be ashamed of. I had this sense that they were like a medal for surviving. So I'm dropping the disorder part on my post traumatic stress. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"Please bear with my rant here. I feel like the only people who truly have empathy with me are other survivors of child abuse. Everyone else keeps saying, ""But your parents really care"" or some such BS. And even people who don't say that you can tell that deep down they don't respect you, especially for having the problems that come with PTSD/CPTSD or the problems that your parents create when they abuse you. They are secretly giving themselves points for having been stronger or having been more ingenious at dealing with obstacles. They secretly think that they are better. They have no idea how degrading child abuse is and the toll it takes on a person's mental health. They have no idea how betrayal feels. And this disrespect is not just something out in the ether somewhere, the contempt for survivors not having ""kept it together"" and stayed as ""sane"" as them is a continual drain because all day long I have to interact with people who look at me this way. I feel it and live with subtle but ever draining contempt from people every day. It's like how black people feel trying to explain racism to white people, and how women feel trying to explain sexism to men or how rich people have no idea what it is like to struggle financially.


Even if people ""say"" nothing, you feel the judgement in the way that they look at you, they always think that they deserve to have what they had, they worked hard for it (they worked harder than you is the assumption/implication). They refuse to acknowledge the added struggles that you had to bear. And it's always, ""Why didn't you just hold it together in stressful times and keep going the way that I did ?"" Meanwhile they don't understand the toll that shame takes and the toll that betrayal takes and they don't want to understand or see a need to understand that you had to grapple with so much more than them. In fact they find it threatening to their sense of accomplishment and pride. They need to have their pride that they were so much stronger than you to get their stuff and they feel diminished in acknowledging that they weren't that much stronger, they simply had things a lot easier. People will do anything to avoid giving this ounce of dignity and human respect to a survivor of abuse. And it hurts being treated this way. It takes a toll. You go through the abuse, and then when you get through it you have to live with a society that has contempt for you as a survivor.


I honestly have no problem trying to keep it together and acting like I have it together even when I feel awful or when I feel like I'm not together, but the continual diminishment of the courage and disparagement hard work that it takes for me to do this takes a toll. You feel people's contempt for your hard work. They look at it and it doesn't matter to them, it doesn't exist or they want to make it not exist. But it is hard to keep putting in that level of hard work, it's hard to keep having that motivation with people's diminishment and disparagement of my hard work. It is crazy making because society is constantly sending you the message that, ""No it is not that hard, it's as easy for you as everyone else."" What do you do with your feelings about how much you are struggling through and how much hard work you are putting in when society resolutely and determinedly denies how hard it is for you? When people give you that message it makes you hate yourself. It makes you hate your feelings, it makes you hate your feelings of how hard it is for you. It is incredibly disparaging to you there who are swimming frantically and struggling so hard just to stay afloat. It drains your motivation to try. It shames you, it makes you think that your feelings of exhaustion are wrong and something to be ashamed of. It adds to your burden of making you feel that something is wrong with you for hurting this way and finding it so hard. The continual contempt from people and minimization of the immense hard work we put in just to survive takes a toll and makes it impossible to keep your spirits and motivation up to keep putting in that level of work. Then of course if my motivation falters because society is telling me my hard work doesn't exist, then I'm to blame for not ""keeping it together."" During all of this people continued to enable my father to harass me and enable his abuse. 


The time in my life when I was the most mentally healthy and was the most together was when I had a friend who had been a similar victim of child abuse to me as a child and had experienced the same level of rejection and betrayal from her parents. I am immensely grateful for having had her. I believe that I would not have graduated high school and my life would be in a much worse situation if I hadn't had her. The thing that she gave me was genuine understanding and empathy and she did not scorn me or subtly minimize the abuse like everyone else did. She actually understood and said that it was wrong. For non survivors as a nice starting place it would be great if people would at least admit that they have no idea how degrading child abuse is. They just have no idea. People always think they have some idea, no it's about a 1000 times worse than you think it is. Just start there by admitting that you truly don't know and can't wrap your mind around it. 


The only people who truly understand how much work I'm putting in and who recognize my courage in getting  through this on any level are other survivors of child abuse. They are the only people who don't disparage my hard work and actually have respect for other survivors and the strength it took to get us through.

PTSD,"This perspective so infuriating and disgusting. I've had numerous people try to deny my trauma and my strength in surviving things. I get my strength diminished from the, ""I want to take credit for all my accomplishments and feel that I'm amazing and better than everyone else. Admitting that I had it easier than you not having to go through trauma will diminish my self satisfaction,"" crowd and then the people who haven't accomplished as much want to say, ""Your trauma doesn't count because it wasn't as bad as mine so it wasn't real abuse.""

PTSD,"I'm having a very long week. I've been feeling so much shame. I was getting so (a mixture of) angry and ashamed last week and that I could not sleep. I am disappointed in a lot of people. Everyone seems to be requiring so much of me. People are making empty promises to me and trying to manipulate me and it is so hurtful. I feel more and more ashamed. I guess that these people are not fair. And then they try to help and they get frustrated that their help wasn't enough and blame me. I also opened up to someone about my trauma, initially she was supportive but then she decided that it was too much for her and disappeared. I am really hurt. I feel like I can't win or do OK at this no matter what I do. I've been attacked repeatedly for talking about my trauma by so many people. People just get so angry when I talk about it, my family hates it since it was family violence. Other people look disgusted and get upset. 

I am trying my absolute best and have been trying for a long time. No one sees how hard I am trying, they just label me as lazy. I feel so hurt and shamed by it. I am so so tired of people blaming me no matter what. I tried desperately every way possible to deal with my trauma when it blew up, counsellors just added to the burden and everyone judged me for it. Now everyone is further judgemental and shaming. I am tired of being given the short end of the stick and people always assuming that I can do things that I can't. It's deeply hurtful. I am very very frustrated with people.

PTSD,I'm having a lot of trouble with insomnia. At night when I try to go to bed I feel very angry. My jaw clenches and I can't relax. I don't know what I am so angry about. It's difficult because I don't even know where this emotion is coming from. My adrenaline literally seems to be turned all the way up. I don't really have a visual or in other way sensorial flashback as far as I can tell. Around 2 or 3 am I finally fall asleep after laying there in bed livid for a couple of hours. I sleep three hours (never more than five) and then wake up the next day. ,lovinglily
PTSD,"I was friends with someone who was very supportive and caring, she would listen to me and help me out with things on numerous occasions. However the one thing that she could not let me do was be sad. She always had to cheer me up and to tell me to look on the bright side. I cared about her (and her opinion of me) a great deal, to the point where I felt uncomfortable being sad in front of her and sometimes she would notice when I was sad and force me out of it. I had this fear that if I was truly sad I would lose her friendship. In the end I did because she absolutely did not understand me asking her to not ""cheer me up"" all the time. I really felt embarrassed with her.

Another thing I grapple with is the need to put on a positive face for people and say that I think things are going OK and are going to work out. I have NO idea whether things are going to work out and yes I seem to need to keep reassuring people that they will work out. And actually having to be ""positive"" with people all the time that I'm hopeful makes me feel even more anxious that things are not going to work out. It makes me feel ashamed and terrified to feel my feelings. It adds a lot of anxiety over feeling the way that I do. I hesitate to feel through things. 

I know that this is a social convention to a large extent and it's something that people say to gloss over other people's feelings. I sense that they aren't good with sadness or tragedy and I fear being rejected by them. It made me feel anxious and ashamed of my trauma because I felt that their acceptance was conditional. I was afraid that if I felt the way I felt and if they knew, they would not be able to handle it and want me as a friend because they are so uncomfortable with sadness. I definitely don't feel like this with everyone, but there are few people who understand the things that I have been through and are comfortable with it, who I don't feel ashamed with. Has anyone else had a similar experience with friends ? What are your thoughts on this ?

PTSD,"How do you explain your parents to people ? I find it is hard, since I have been a child my father has been humiliating me publicly. In church he would scream at me publicly in front of everyone else or start beating me to show how bad a person I was. As I got to be a teenager and this became not quite kosher the same way (though he still did it at home behind closed doors, coming up and physically fighting with me and hitting me) he then would tell everyone that he was having ""problems"" with me and manipulate people into coming over to pray for me and talk to me (i.e. bully me). I went to university far away from him and he was sending people to email me, phone me and visit me. As a child he used to tell me this story about this ""bad"" man who never listened to his mother and when he grew up he was ""bad"" so he went to jail and when he went to jail his mother came to visit him and he said, ""Mom I want to tell you a secret"" his mother leaned in to hear him and he bit off her ear. He would say that to tell me he was ""afraid that I was heading down that road."" I felt awful and hopeless after hearing that.  The most difficult thing about what he did was sometimes not the actual acts of doing it, it was the constant and ever present humiliation which I had no control over. No matter how much I tried to please him I would still be humiliated either way. 

My father does this with other people too, he puts them on the spot and uses shame as a method to control them but being his daughter I get the worst of it. 

People do not understand why I just can't brush it off and get on with my life. I've been reading about shame (humiliation is shaming) and the toll that shame takes on people. Most recently I was reading Brene Brown on this in Daring Greatly. Has anyone else read this ? I also read a study about how this psychologist once found a way to predict divorce within 10 years with 90% accuracy in couples. If he found one partner scorning and shaming the other when they talked about a difficult topic, the relationship predictably could not survive the constant humiliation. People just don't have the capacity to stay in a situation where their dignity and sense of self is being assaulted like this and maintain their mental health. They have to get out in order to preserve their health. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I feel like I'm isolating myself from people because at the moment I can't set boundaries as well as I want to be able to. I don't feel good about myself and so I feel like it's very hard for me to set boundaries with people. I feel like I set boundaries almost in retrospect, like I will come back a day or a week later and say, ""That was not OK. I was not OK with that, please don't do that again"" and I notice that other people (and when I'm feeling good I too) can set boundaries almost more intuitively and almost effortlessly and not for big things, and a day or two after it happens but almost like I feel free to express hesitancy or reluctance when something small doesn't make me feel right. Setting boundaries at a later date (over bigger things) almost ensures that there are more hurt feelings and it causes more of a disruption.

It's hard to explain, it's like when I am feeling good I almost do it subconsciously, in a way that when I am feeling ashamed even if I were putting all my effort into it, I wouldn't be able to do it automatically and I wouldn't notice and sense things quickly enough to do it. It takes so much energy and sorrow to be setting boundaries in this state of mind and setting them at the point where I'm able to do so almost after the fact is inclined to cause more friction and take more energy as well.

PTSD,"From now on I'm repledging to just do my best for myself. I'm not killing myself about bending over backwards to make situations turn out OK or to make people like me if they have a misconception about me. I'm just going to do my best and if that isn't good enough, maybe things fall apart or never get put back together but I'm going to be OK with myself. I'm not going to get down on myself for not being better or superhuman.

I think that a lot of the time when people go through trauma we are made to feel like we have to be superhuman in response to it, because a normal human response of being broken or traumatized isn't good enough for many people and you might lose jobs and other aspects of your life if you just have a normal response. There is a due date for recovery and an expectation that you will get over it and survivors/victims wonder if they will indeed have the strength and ability to get over it by that date or if they will have the ability to control their sadness/anger/shame resulting from the trauma enough to be polite and likeable. Has anyone else noticed this or had the same experience ?

In my experience sometimes your best is enough and sometimes it isn't enough and you do lose out when your best isn't good enough and superhuman strength was required. (At least this has been my experience and this is how I now view the world, that sometimes your best isn't good enough and things will still fall apart, but you still have to try anyway). In those sorts of situations when your best isn't good enough to keep the job or friends etc or you are afraid that it might not be, it's so easy in those situations to put pressure on yourself to do better than your best and be superhuman. For me it's really hard when I am terrified that my best won't be enough to hold the situation together (and all hell may break lose because my best isn't good enough) to still love myself and be OK with my best regardless but I am deciding to be OK with my best.

I feel an incredible amount of shame that this has happened to me before and now it is happening to me again, like this means there is something deeply wrong with ME that this is happening more than once and it's my fault for not stopping it from happening again. I feel like it must be something about me that I deserve for this to happen to me that this keeps happening to me. I feel like I have a sense of denial about it that ""This is not happening."" I don't particularly sad about what is happening to me because in a way I feel like I deserve it or I am sort of dissociated from it or something. I feel like I deserve to be going through all of this pain, it's not bad that it's happening because it's happening to a really awful person who deserves it. I don't feel sad about what's happening to be me because I don't feel like I deserve any better. It's happened before and is happening again because I'm an awful person. And no one cared to help before and no one cares to help now either and no matter how hard I work to get out this will always keep happening to me (partly thanks to my parents) because this is all I deserve and all that I'm good for pain. I'm the one that the ""bad things happen to"" and are allowed to happen to. I'm the one whose suffering everyone writes off as if I'm deserving of the worst things while other people are actually helped to not end up in my situation. I feel a very deep sense of hopelessness because this has happened before and every time it keeps happening I feel like a worse person who really doesn't deserve to have anything. I don't even feel like killing myself because I feel like however much pain I'm in it I don't care to kill myself because the pain I am in doesn't count anyway, I'm not worth not suffering.

PTSD,"I've been noticing in myself a tendency to avoid people when I feel they are getting too close to me. As soon as someone seems nice it feels like I have a flashback of my mother that they are unexpectedly going to turn on me and claw me to pieces. 
I am terrified of getting into relationships after the relationship I had with my parents growing up. My experience of a relationship is that the person's claws come out unexpectedly without the slightest notice over and over and that is how the relationship goes. 

At the same time I feel like I am traumatically bonded to my parents and I can't seem to lead an independent life and I can't process everything that happened with them. When they seem the slightest bit nice (they can be very charming) I feel like my heart yearns for that love that I missed out on and I just want to believe at all costs that this is love and they do care. I can't seem to put the two pictures of them together the charm and the pain, and yet the pain comes out in flashbacks with strangers and other people.

This is the oddest thing to me because this is exactly the opposite of my reaction with other people where when they seem the littlest bit nice I panic and expect the claws to come out next (which I have little evidence for). But with my parents even though I have ample evidence that this phenomenon of the claws coming out will in fact happen, I don't feel the flashbacks this way. I almost like fawn. I don't know if this is a flashback response itself. It's completely senseless.  ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I have been abused by many people but the thing that makes me feel most awful is how my parents treated me and continue to treat me. I watch other people's parents treat them with respect and care and I can't get past the fact or bend the reality that my parents just didn't, don't care and never will care. No matter what I do, what I manage to accomplish or how hard I work in life I will never be able to get this. My parents will never see me as worthy of respect and love and care. I feel very ashamed and I feel like it is something that I can never quite get over. My parents were involved in religious leadership and almost my entire social world of people growing up looked up to my parents and would not acknowledge the abuse which further shamed me. I felt like I was a lesser form of being (like a dog) that you could treat badly (for a human) but that was OK it did not count as abuse. My parents just do not care. I feel like a second class citizen in the world like I will never have that sense of being quite good enough which is the thing that it seems sometimes I wish for the most. It's almost the way some people describe being black, no matter how hard you work or how high you climb or what you accomplish you will always just be a black person and that's all you will ever be to a lot of people. I feel the same that that's all I will be a second class citizen and regarded as that by some people and there's nothing I can do about it. The only thing that helps is knowing that there were a lot of other people who went through the same thing and also had/have parents who violated their trust and did not care.

Maybe this is depressing to talk about feeling this way and wanting that feeling of being loved and feeling assured that you are indeed worth just as much as anyone else and good like all the rest of the humans but for me whether I talk about it or not the pain is always there, it's always in the background anyway.

PTSD,"This is beyond heartbreaking knowing that PTSD sufferers/trauma survivors are killing themselves. I am really upset about LivingInFearPTSD girl posting that she is killing herself. I hope she isn't dead but it looks like she is dead. I don't think I can go through another person on here killing themselves. Please don't anyone else on here kill themselves! I have been feeling just numb for the past couple of days (I couldn't/can't even feel sad) because she was pretty clear from some of her posts that that was her intention. I was having suicidal thoughts tonight in response so this. 

I was trying to tell her not to kill herself that a lot of us feel the same shame but it didn't work. We all fighting a very hard battle and struggling to survive ourselves and it is hard knowing that someone like us has died from it. Her posts over the last couple of days have really taken a toll on my mental health. It is a shame that society did not take her trauma more seriously and help her or prevent it from hapening. We all need to work to change the things in society like abusers/sexual abusers who are causing this PTSD that is killing people. 

I've personally taken steps to try to inform a mother and protect girls that were in the situation this poster was in from abuse. It's chilling to know that those kids could have ended up dead like this from their stepfather's abuse if I hadn't done that (and actually I don't necessarily know that I was able to protect them, they may have been abused and could still end up dead). I've been wishing I could take some MDMA after this incident (but at the same time I kind of don't want to get high because all my own trauma is going to come up on it and I can't deal with that right now) also I don't have any MDMA and I don't want to take it.

PTSD,"Lately I have been thinking about dignity and respect as survivors of trauma. This might seem like an odd post for this subreddit but I feel like it might not only be applicable to us here and but also extra applicable to us since many of our traumas (if they were interpersonal traumas such as rape, child abuse, or being trapped in a traumatic situation to further someone else's ends) were basically caused by people such as the person who attacked us not respecting us. 

I feel that this is also an important question and consideration since sometimes when you have an illness and especially one that affects you emotionally other people easily ""lose"" respect for you, particularly if they don't understand what you are going through. I think that this is one painful aspect of PTSD, watching other people who respected us before lose respect for us as a result of the PTSD symptoms. All our strength and hard work in living each day and putting out best foot forward in a challenging situation can easily go unseen except by the people who respect us. We can be compared to people who are not struggling with PTSD and all the hard work we are doing just to deal with our pain is invisible and can become discounted especially by people who want to believe that the world is a fair place and that it is a meritocracy (to some extent because they want to take credit for their success and where their hard work got them). It's easy to lose our sense of dignity when struggling with PTSD. 

I would like to hear your thoughts on this. What does respect mean to you ? Who has had respect for you and how have they shown it ? How can you tell when a person respects you ? What does a person who respects you say or do ? Can you give some examples ? What are your thoughts on respect ? Thank you in advance for any replies.

Put another way is it so necessary for therapists and others to look down on us in order to treat us ?

It's just that I am off in my mind worrying or being upset. I think that it is like dissociation but it isn't quite dissociation. A couple years ago I was listening to a fun talk and I was off in my mind and then the woman giving the talk noticed that I wasn't there and stared at me very pointedly and determinedly as if to say, ""Come back here.""

I am lucky because school is the one thing I am good at so I was able to do it even dissociated half of the time.

The whole thing felt a bit uncomfortable because I felt like my feelings were wrong about what I had been through, like she was getting me to be more sad than I actually am and I was feeling like my feelings were wrong and that she knew my feelings better than I did. It felt like she had too much control in the interaction and I had too little. Logically the program looks good and I agree with it philosophically and everything but in terms of how it feels to me it in some ways it felt wrong. Usually I go with how I feel logically rather than my gut sense but that has not worked out well on a few occasions. I'm disappointed since I was looking forward to this and thinking that this would be good. 

The thing is that at the end of the day my mental health is my responsibility. It's not someone else's. If there is something wrong here I'm going to be the one responsible for my mental health. I can't hand over the responsibility to anyone else.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Trying to access mental healthcare to take care of my mental health feels like a continual struggle. I had an exploitative counsellor a few years ago and from there things have spiralled out of control. During this time my PTSD started happening from this combined with a traumatic incident. Other counsellors I have seen have refused to acknowledge that he did anything wrong which of course left me unable to trust them. 

It's getting to the point for me where I have almost given up seeking help. I am so demoralized. I feel awful. I notice that I have a very proactive approach towards my physical healthcare. I feel that physically taking care of myself is my responsibility and even if the doctor gives me the wrong advice about taking care of my body, I need to look out for myself and take responsibility because it will be me living with whatever consequences not the doctor. 

But in regard to my mental healthcare, it feels like I have learned helplessness. It is so hard to access help that it feels frustrating and out of my reach. It feels like my mental health is something that is not entirely in my control to take care of. It seems like I get and loose good mental healthcare arbitrarily and that it's something other people have control over rather than me. It's demoralizing to not have the tools and help I need to stay mentally healthy within reach. I feel like I can't take care of myself and good mental health is outside of my reach. I don't feel competent about taking care of myself mentally or proactive about my mental health but at the same time I can see that if I faced the obstacles in regard to my physical health that I do in regard to my mental health I would likely be extremely demoralized and may have given up on that too at this point rather than having the attitude that things are within my hands. It's hard to take responsibility for something that you don't have significant amounts of control over.",lovinglily
PTSD,"I'm having a horrible day. I found out today that my ex bf who broke up with  me because the PTSD was so bad and because I can't have a relationship with anyone while living with family, has a new girlfriend. I've also been feeling really low the past week. 

On the spur of the moment I decided to start talking to my cousin about the abuse and she told me that I just need to forgive my parents. We had a big argument about that. I don't know how that started. I am feeling really low and almost numb. Everything is falling apart here and I can't seem to put it back together no matter how hard I try and I'm so angry at everyone. How did this happen ? I am really upset that I just brought it up with her out of the blue, I didn't realize that I was so upset and this not even being aware of my feelings scares me.",lovinglily
PTSD,"I'm not sure if it is because of the multiple incidents of abuse I have faced but I feel like taking care of my mental health is such a struggle that I've almost given up. It's hard to access good help. 
I also feel that I struggle to take personal responsibility for my mental health. I feel like mental health is something that just happens to me, that other people do to me which is outside of my control and if other people are just nice enough love can fix my problems. I feel that I have come to be quite unproactive about my mental health. Does anyone else feel the same ?

This is so different however from how I relate to my physical health which I am very proactive about. I feel that my body is mine and I am in a way alone with it if it is diseased, no one can save me from myself so I need to take care of myself. I'm the one that is going to suffer if I don't take care of my physical body not other people, not the doctors. I feel that it is my responsibility to take care of my physical body. 

But with my mental health I find it hard to see it this way. Maybe I have just been attacked too many times so I've given up hope that I can keep myself safe and healthy mentally. I feel like mental health is something that just happens to me and isn't within my reach to take care of. For me medical care for my physical health has been a lot easier to access than mental healthcare. I might have gotten frustrated and given up over my physical health if medicine and medical care were practically impossible to access the way that mental healthcare has been.",lovinglily
PTSD,"A lot of my PTSD really got worse a few years ago when I talked about my abuse to my friend. She was being open about her abuse with me and when I told her about my abuse she denied it. It is difficult for me because I feel alienated not just from the general population but also from people who have experienced abuse as well. I feel like ""they"" wouldn't want me in their group either. I don't feel a part of this group, I feel like that group wouldn't want me either. This is really hard. I have been left with the feeling that I am completely on my own. I can't shake this feeling, this sense that I'm completely alone. I don't feel a part of anyone or any group not even the group of abuse survivors/victims. All I can think all the time is how people would deny my abuse how they are not really on my side and they would be hating me if they knew what had happened to me.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Yesterday after waiting almost 8 months I saw a neurologist. I might have temporal lobe epilepsy and I'm getting sent for an MRI. He understood my aura (?)/weird feeling of my jaw feeling enormous when I was falling asleep (which the GPs looked at me like I was crazy when I mentioned) and the constant deja vu feelings. I was also having this sense of waking up and forgetting who I was last summer. I can't explain the stress of it all of having these weird feelings. Have other people felt the same ? I mean I don't really understand but having those feelings was really really upsetting. I felt like I was losing my mind particularly with the waking up and being half asleep and not remembering. Among other things I ended up self medicating (which was not a good choice), I don't know why I just didn't tell the doctor and focus on pursuing seeing a neurologist like crossed my mind, I just thought I was incredibly depressed and stressed out and on the verge of losing my mind and it was from that. It was awful feeling like I was stressed out to that degree. 

To some extent I don't understand why the other symptoms in particular the deja vu and feeling like my jaw was huge were so upsetting. But I feel a sense of relief at someone getting it. Have you had similar experiences ?",lovinglily
PTSD,"How do you all deal with the effects of your PTSD symptoms on those around you/those you care about ? And how do you deal with the effects on your own self esteem ? 

I realize that rationally dealing with my PTSD symptoms is like dealing with someone who can't stop throwing up. They throw up where ever you go with them, and all over the building at work and on your nice rug and they throw up on the floor and you have to clean it up and you have to make sure you're not in your nice clothes around them. 

I hate that I'm the one throwing up on the floor and getting it dirty for other people AND of course I feel absolutely 100x more awful from throwing up all the time in the first place and wish I could be well so much :( Knowing that you are getting someone's floor dirty doesn't help with the shame of PTSD either. I am really fed up of having this, I want this to end. Sometimes I feel suicidal.

I was getting counselling for things but then I tried to be open with someone else about what I was confronting and he just didn't believe me or want to help. I felt like he saw me as a liar. The shame since then has been overwhelming (and I stopped getting counselling and have been afraid to go back because the world just can't deal with this) and I've kind of given up hope that people can understand me. I've also felt a lot of anger towards people for not believing or helping me. I just feel so ashamed and I feel that people won't believe me, I can't bear to be with my friends and I feel alienated from them.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Does anyone feel helpless ? I feel helpless. I've been trying to fix whatever is going on with me for 4 years and despite what I try it always seems nothing seems helpful. A lot of family members have said that they don't believe me and I feel like every time I try to help myself I get cut down by someone who doesn't care, people are not only not helping but actively cutting me down and telling me I'm wrong/lying. I feel like I just can't handle it. I can't handle being cut down anymore. I don't think I can trust anyone again.

I know a lot of people have tried to be helpful but I can't explain to them that it's hard to not just crumble in shame and not be able to get up off the floor or accept their help in any way when you have multiple people calling you a liar and trying to shame you. I feel like people can't understand that how difficult it is to deal with the shame and how much it makes me hate myself and completely paralyzes me. People think that other people shaming me and not believing me is no big deal but it really hurts. I feel like people blame me instead for being lazy.

I do feel like I have to take responsibility for my life though and know that my life is my responsibility to direct. I just feel so frustrated and helpless though. 

I do really feel that I have to take responsibility for my life though. If I don't fix things I will suffer. I just don't want to be blamed for it though. I am also just finding it so hard to have to motivation to work hard on fixing my life. I know that I need to work hard but I just can't seem to find that drive to do it within myself anymore.",lovinglily

PTSD,"[http://www.cphpost.dk/community/trailblazing-continent-foot-raising-awareness-child-sex-abuse]

This article is titled: ""Trailblazing the continent on foot, raising awareness of child sex abuse""
Some excerpts: CBeebies actor Matthew McVarish, himself the victim of an abusive uncle, is taking a 16,000km trek to raise awareness of the problem
A star of the BBC children’s programme ‘Me Too!’, McVarish also works as the European ambassador for the non-profit organisation Stop the Silence: Stop Child Sexual Abuse. He said he views his trip around Europe as one of the responsibilities of the position.
McVarish pointed out, however, that his intentions weren’t to drag out the past for him or for anyone he meets on the road. Instead, he hopes to help prevent cases of abuse in the future by encouraging victims to speak up.
“I’ve spoken to thousands of survivors on my walk, and I ask them if they’ve ever talked to the police. Many say that they don’t feel strong enough to stand in the same courtroom as the person who abused them,” he said.
“I completely understand that, because it’s very difficult,” he went on. “But I ask them: ‘Do you think you’re stronger as an adult than the child that same person might abuse tonight, or tomorrow, or next week?’ It’s not about seeking revenge or compensation, it’s about child protection right now.”
Stopping the silence
In each city he visits, McVarish meets with public officials to encourage policy change, particularly in regards to the respective country’s statute of limitations for reporting cases of child sex abuse. While no statute exists in McVarish’s home country, it is currently set at ten years in Denmark and varies throughout Europe.
“There will always be cases just outside of the bracket, no matter the amount of time,” McVarish said. “And the person who abused them could still be out walking the streets.”
But the main focus of his walk, McVarish pointed out, is to facilitate open discussions about abuse in communities where the topic is seldom addressed.
“There are an estimated 100 million abuse survivors in Europe, many of them in rural areas. So for their local paper to have a guy on the front page talking about sex abuse not as a scandal, but just trying to deal with it, can be very valuable.”

PTSD,"I saw an article about Elizabeth Loftus today and False Memory Syndrome. This woman really upsets me. She did one study that false memories of being lost in a shopping mall can be implanted and now her whole career is based on saying that child sexual abuse victims are confused (i.e. lying). 

I just don't understand how she can do this to the most vulnerable of the vulnerable, victims of child abuse by someone in their families. It is so upsetting to hear about her testifying in these cases to keep child sexual abusers from facing prosecution and justice. It is sad. 

I also don't understand how someone that calls them a researcher/scientist can get themselves involved in such a political and legal issue and be working as an expert consultant getting paid to testify in court. I mean researchers are supposed to be impartial but to base your whole career around one point of view, means that you start wanting only results that confirm that. I feel like she is targeting child sexual abuse victims in particular. 

I also don't understand why she seems to be mainly applying her ""false memory"" ideas to just incest victims. You would think that false memory could apply to many situations across the board not just to one issue.

PTSD,"I have gone through some very difficult things with my fundamentalist religious parents. For a long time I have felt like the things that they do violate my sense of morality/conscience. See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1muroe/dealing_with_traumatic_events_how_to_deal_kind_of/) for an example. I feel like I cannot take the pain of how they treat me and also how they treat other people anymore. I am considering ending things with them but it is difficult for me. I care about them to some extent as well, and I am also terrified of society's opprobrium/anger disapproval towards anyone who would make a break with family. I am an INTP. I wanted to ask some NFs their thoughts on this because I am inclined to want to do non traditional things and ""innovate"" being an N. I don't understand why I should have to follow social convention and stay close to my family no matter what, logically it makes no sense and seems ridiculous, but then being an INTP I'm not terribly aware of and good at managing feelings. I'm not good at budgeting for my and others emotional needs. I've had my bf tell me it's not a good idea to leave and it's really hard not to listen to him. A few counsellors I talked to were not in favour of me leaving even though the relationship is bad and hurting me because they thought that I was, ""too upset about it, it seems kind of like you want to leave but you don't."" One counsellor thought it was a good idea. It was hard for me to know whether these counsellors were uncomfortable with the idea because of tradition and ""family above all else"" which it seems most people in our society adhere to or something else. 

So I wanted to ask some NFs your thoughts, because I figure you all are likely to have a better grip on feelings than me and also to not be locked into tradition at all costs. Have any of you ever done this or watched any of your friends do this ? How did you feel about it ?

Edit: I want to ask this, I feel that I can do a sort of logical costs benefits analysis about leaving my family versus staying but emotionally it's hard for me to have a sense of it, it's hard for me to size it up in an emotionally engaged way. It's hard for me to feel the situation as a whole. I can feel parts of it, like the benefits and then the costs of it but I can't feel it all together. How does this feel to you all who have decided to leave emotionally ?",lovinglily
PTSD,"I can handle J types neatness and organization etc. I notice I find it hard to deal with their certainty about things. I often find it comes across as either arrogant and overly certain. I often feel like J types get my back up against a wall and I feel cornered and stubborn. Also their ways of communicating/advocating their points don't appeal to me. The more certain they get about the point that they are making and that they are right, the more resistant I feel to what they are saying. Does anyone else feel the same ? It's a lot easier for someone to get me to listen if they appeal to uncertainty, and say, ""Well I can't be certain that you are right."" I find that of course quite intriguing/interesting.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Firstly let me say, this is difficult to deal with the following as an INTP because I'm not good at sensing and talking about my feelings. The INTP drive for knowledge and, ""If I find out enough I'll be competent and I just need to learn everything to deal with this. The more upset I get the more knowledge I try to gather"" means that I just read more and more upsetting statistics and upsetting stories, and not being super in tune with feelings I just process things rationally and I don't even have a great grasp on how much my continuing delving into this is upsetting me. Not to mention the INTP ""The truth is what matters I have to find out the truth"" and paying attention to logic and making decisions by logic rather than taking feelings (my feelings) into consideration. 

I'm 29, I was sexually abused by a guy in my church when I was 7 and a couple years ago the same man married a woman with children from a previous marriage. My parents fucking knew what happened with me (I told them when I was 7 because the whole ""Keeping a secret thing seemed illogical/pretentious/grated on my truthful ""I hate pretending"" logical self"") and said nothing/did nothing to intervene. A bunch of people knew and did nothing. 

It was basically hell for me to try to get anyone to listen and get those kids away from him. People's attitudes (including numerous counsellors (more like 7 of them) I have been to, YES I have talked to a counsellor about this, but they are mostly F types which I will get to in a minute) and apathy towards this issue is just unbelievable. Everyone is all ""Oh I'm against child abuse"" but when it happens no one wants to lift a finger to help. 

As an INTP I have a low tolerance for fakeness and the fakeness upsets me. I really don't ""get"" it about the Fs just being ""nice"" and saying things that they don't believe in to make everyone ""feel nice."" And I don't get it about the S types just not wanting to rock the boat and just go along with things as they've always been done, you know we want to be conventional, and I've never seen someone talk about sexual abuse before or take steps to deal with it and I don't want to be the first. I don't understand why people can't just do the right thing. 



It really irritates me that this is all about being socially/politically correct to most people and there's no ""truth"" in it and conviction about the truth in it, and everyone is so fake competent at dealing with it. Everyone knows exactly which boxes to tick off and all the right fake words to say to convince everyone they are politically correct. It's all just a fucking social game to people. 


I wish every person that says they ""CARE"" about this but doesn't would just get rid of themselves honestly. ~7 counsellors heard about this from me, they are legally obligated to report it but none of them did. They all told ""me"" to report it. I eventually did report it to a hotline even though I am the person who suffered through this myself and for whom it is hardest to talk about this and expose myself. The kids are now away from this man, apparently the mother finally listened (and my parents finally spoke up) and left him. It's not just the perpetrators who cause this to continue to happen it's the people who say, ""oh I'm a good person. I would stand up against that"" and then do nothing and want to protect perpetrators. I wish not only the perpetrators but those fake people who say they care but they don't were in hell where they were having to relive the abuse they put other people through every single day until they figure it the fuck out that it's wrong and stop with the fakeness.

Dealing with a situation like this is clearly not my strong suit (?) or area of competence at all. 

Edit:  ~7 counsellors heard about this from me, they are legally obligated to report it but NONE of them did. Why did you sign up to be a counsellor and agree to report things like this and what the fuck did they teach you in psychology/counselling school if it makes you too uncomfortable to deal with stuff like this ? They are there to make money, play peekabo with people and do nothing productive whatsoever.

I wasn't completely clear, the kids are away from this man. But it just feels like a very tiny victory knowing that I was basically the *only* person in the situation who gave a fuck about stopping it. ",lovinglily

My fundamentalist Christian parents who knew what he did to me, did nothing to try and help/remove this kids and that really broke my heart (they knew even before me that this predator was marrying this woman with children and they didn't care to do anything).
I told everyone in the church and my entire extended family about the abuse and that this man was kids to try to protect them almost even though I didn't want to expose myself. It was like PTSD flashbacks to feel that this was happening to another kid again.



Personally I don't know how far I would have gone in reporting this man and exposing everything to the light. I have horrible feelings about speaking up, I felt (/feel) quite ashamed and went far beyond what I was comfortable with trying to report this stuff. I did it partly because after the PTSD blew up I just stopped giving a f%&*, I want social support but I just don't have the motivation.

I just don't care, I don't care to do all the social niceties and be polite and generally fit in in society.

It feels like a trauma just to be alive, I don't want to live on this planet with people.



I don't give a f&%*. I can't remember feeling this apathetic at any point in my life before. I feel that I can't trust in people anymore. I just don't care to make any sort of working relationship with anyone work. I'm not pushing anyone away (people are jerks enough as it is) but I'm not editing myself or making myself approvable either. I feel like with friends like my best friend and parents and church, why even bother ? With friends like that who needs enemies ? I'm not doing anything horrible to people but I don't feel like I'll ever have a real honest connection with anyone anymore.



Whether people can understand the situation you are in and be on your side just seems so arbitrary.

I was reading in the book on PTSD that people have been able to survive traumatic experiences and get through them better with less risk of PTSD if they did something about the trauma that was happening (usually to try and stop it/fix it), their efforts didn't even have to work, they just had to be active and be doing something (and I guess not feeling completely helpless) for it to lessen their risk of PTSD.

Hi r/AskDocs,

I posted a while ago about Stomach and Intestine-ache. Since then I had to quit Wellbutrin for a week and my stomach and intestines were healed. Now I'm on them again for 7 days and it hurts again. 

I went to my GP a while ago, she said it couldn't be the Wellbutrin, but it IS.
What can I do to make it better? I tried almost everything; Senna - Miralax - Microgol and more. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in about two weeks, and he is going to do research, but my intestines are killing me! 

What can I do? 

Love,

Since taking Wellbutrin XR 150mg since January 10th 2015 I'm very constipated all the time. My stomach hurts when eating, bloated. My intestines hurt when eating.

My GP gave me Microgol&Electrolytes sachets to dissolve with water which makes me nauseous and make me vomit. Then she gave me Bisacodyl, which helps but I can only take it 3 days in a row.
I tried Senna-tea, fiber, phylum, flaxseed, coffee... nothing helps. Except the Bisacodyl which I can't take consecutively.
My GP also diagnosed me with IBS before giving me the Microgol.

I (Dawn - 21F) just want to say: I love you guys. I really love this sub. I'm happy you're all here. ( eh. That sounds weird. I'm sorry shit happened to all of you, but I'm glad you are amazing people and this sub is so nice) 

a week ago on Thursday I went to a acupuncturist. He told me I had a 'shock' in my soul and he asked if I had a date ( I only told him 'something' happened why I am in therapy and not working or studying), I don't know how and I am very very skeptical about this kind of stuff, but he searched for the data in some kind of book and he put a needle in my leg. 

Instant pain. Instant flashbacks. My leg froze, then my other leg too. couldn't move. ( *please read on till the end: it gets better!* ) The acupuncturist told me I had to get through it and it would be better after it. I don't know how long I had that needle, but flashbacks. my body hurt. I was crying really hard and begging my boyfriend to stop it, but he just held my hand. ( at that moment I REALLY hated him for 'not saving' me)

After that when I was sitting next to my boyfriend in the car it felt like everything just happened all over again without me blacking out. it was horrible and fucked up. Got a few new pieces back from what happened.

But since that day, since almost a week, I havent had nightmares. I even had sexy times this week!!! ( its been way too long- especially without me stopping it because flashbacks. but now... I remember why I liked sex so much), I havent seen ""him"" in other people... I'm happy.

Maybe you could try it too. I went to the best of the best in my country, he gives lectures all around the world and he is pretty expensive, but... no nightmares... sexytimes... so I kind of would do anything to not have them. I'm very very skeptical and all about this, but since he was so 'famous' I figured he had done something right. 

I hope you are doing great! PM me about anything if you want to talk/ vent/ discuss; anything!

About a year ago a psychiatrist told me the rape wrapped itself onto my core being, as in I 'am' the rape. I 'identified' as a victim and nothing more, like 'I am Dawn and I am raped' not 'I am Dawn, I am 21 y/o, I live with my boyfriend and our two beautiful kitties' (do you know what I mean or have I lost you already?)

Right now I havent had nightmares for two nights and it kind of scares me.

 I'm (21F) currently out of a job and study and I'm working with a 'jobcoach' who will help me find a job/study. Yesterday I had an appointment with her and she told me she is almost out of ideas/clues for me. 

So I want to ask you to help me out here, with aswering these questions; 

 * How/why did you choose this study/work?
 * what you do?
 * what are your requierments for a job/study?


I've worked in the hospitality business ( I also have a degree 'hospitality hostess' ( basically waitressing) ), I kind of like it but I also hate it very much. 

*why I hate it* 
because, at school and the hotels I worked at you had to be a certain way. The whole attitude wasn't me. Have to wear a skirt and heels, makeup ( otherwise they ask if you are sick- seriously), if you had piercings you had to take them out, tattoos are not done. I don't have tats, but I can't stand why it won't be okay to have those. 
if you had a bad day you could NOT show it and just fake smile 10 hours a day. ( every day 'Dawn, smile!' I can't help I have Resting Bitch Face Syndrome!), working 10 hours and not getting a compliment. I also have this thing what makes that things doesn't get stuck in my head, so I have to ask things 100 times and do things over and over before I get them, but they got angry at me. I have huge anxiety when I have to serve guests. its totally NOT funny.

*why I love it* because you work 10 hours and after a day you're like ""yes, I DID IT!"", feeling your muscles at the end of the day, drinking something with the colleagues after work- this is a big one. I like giving people a great time, loved working parties/weddings etc. Just put your mind off and WALK THOSE APPETIZERS. I love the nice compliments from guests and the regulars. ( that you already know what they want to drink - that you can ask how they are etc) 


Right now I volunteer on a farm and I like it a lot. 
*why I love it* because, I mostly work alone, but I can work together if I want to. I'm outside. The woman who runs the place asks what you want to do and you can tell if it's going bad that day. You can make mistakes and they will help you if you don't get it even if it takes many tries. You're able to choose what you want to do that day, even if its just hug the kitties or drink tea. I like physical work and getting results, thats why I really like weeding. I like getting respect for what I do and that they tell me they are proud at my work. I like getting dirty ( I worked in the hospitality business: everything had to be a certain way and you had to be ultra-clean and stuff - I don't mind but it's just... a person I am not. You had to wear make-up. At school you had to wear heels and a shirt- shirt and tie.) I like the freedom. I like the caring for plants and the animals even though I'm scared I will hurt the animals or weed a plant instead of the weed.


What I know by now:

 * I need a safe environment where I can learn and fuck up things without being jelled at 
 * I need to be able to be alone and not talk to co-workers/customers
 * I need to have people who understand and don't make a fuss if I have a really bad day 
 * I need people to help me out if I ask them to and not getting 'you should know that by now- fix it yourself' thrown   at me
 * I need people to stay the fuck away from me and NOT to tell me what to do
 * but on the other hand I NEED people to tell me what to do because my head's a chaos and I need their affirmation. OR let me work with lists I can check.
 * I want to do something physical 
 * I want to work at day time ( preferably in the morning) 
 * I want to do something with food/plants/writing/photography
 * I want to make something
 * I want to add something awesome to this world 

Do you get why it's so damned hard? I don't want to be picky, but I am. Is that bad? 

Tell me everything you think!

Love,

Dawn

PTSD,"*25-11-2015 // 23:35u, on top of bed.*

Sexytime gone wrong. Again. Zoned out. Flashbacks. His room. I was staring at the lamp in our room, flashback to his room... Same place. Bed. Same fucking LAMP. Jesus fuck. So I tripped and my boyfriend was like 'whats wrong?"" And I told him "" he had the same fucking lamp""

A few months ago I was looking at the lamp in the hallway and in our bedroom and something just felt off. Like I had to remove them. Ofcourse I didn't do that, but now.... My boyfriend took the lamp down in our bedroom.

I know it sounds silly and I'm still.... What the fuck.... A fucking LAMP is causing flashbacks now?! Though I have to say... It's also in the bedroom. 

I'm so fucking done with this shit. I just want rest. I just want to live. Not being afraid. Not not sleeping for nights. 

Why? I still don't get it. Why? BEING HORNY IS NOT A FUCKING EXCUSE. Go fuck YOURSELF. Cunt. How can you do such a thing? Why? Why ME?
Probably because you knew you were stronger but fuck.... Isn't the shit I had not enough to have to deal with? 
Who the FUCK  do you think you are?! I want to hurt you so bad. And I promise you WILL get my fist against your nose. I just.... That's the least i can do for myself. 

""I fucking hate you and I wish you would die it makes me violently angry when I see you alive. You're a fucking mistake, you're an embarrassment mate. You think you're funny and you're clever but you're just a disgrace"" - frank carter ( "" I hate you"") 

Please just leave me alone. Go out of my memories. Throw away the flashbacks. Throw away the whole period. March - Nov 2012: Gone. All you people: Gone. I don't give a fuck. I liked David, I liked Kim and Luke but this is just.... Every fucking memory is stained. Cant look back without feeling and/or seeing other crap. 

I want to sleep. Its midnight.
Maybe god just really hates me. I'm trying to forget, I'm trying to be stronger but every time ( day even) I get punched in the face and fucked over all over again. Wish I wasn't so.... Sensitive. Wish I was more like him. Then I would've gone to trial already. I'm too afraid. Think it will break me even more.

Fuck. Brad. GO TO HELL. I fucking hate you.

You ARE NOT WORTH my thoughts, my tears, my feelings and my SEXYTIME. You aren't. You're scum. Fucking monster.

I'm 21 now. You were 21 then. I really don't get it. How can something be so heartless?
No it doesn't matter you were my ex. No it doesn't matter it was one time. You took away my voice. You took away my strength. My will to live. You gave me nightmares. Afraid. It doesn't matter you were my boyfriend once. It doesn't matter it was one time because the effects are still here. You know what you did? No you did not only put your disgusting junk in me.... You took away my selfworth. The lil grain I had left. My selflove. I feel disgusting. Still. Haven't felt clean since. You took so much from me.

But you won't get my pitty. Yeah. Boohoo you're the victim here. Tell me again how hurt you are. GO TO FUCKING HELL. 
YOU put your PENIS, your junk, your.... Disgusting thing in me. You are NOT the victim.
I wont be sorry for you.

I may forgive you one day, but you will never ever get my pity.

Go fuck yourself.


Love,

Dawn

It's early to think about (23rd of October is the anniversary), but I need to make a solid plan to get through the day.

The title says it all, I really love this dress. It still suits me well and all but it keeps reminding me of a bad event. The thing is: it has nothing to do with the event only the same time-period when I wore the dress a lot. 

Are there any ways to disconnect feelings or should I give it up and throw it out? I havent worn it for 3 years now, just because of the memories. I know if I give it away someone else doesn't have those, but it feels weird and gross to give someone these memories without knowing it... 

Somewhere I would just like to burn it, but it's a beautiful dress which suits me well and would fit someone else just as well...

What would you do?

First of all I want to thank you guys so much for all the love, support and advice you've given me, I am really thankful of having you- these kind strangers. You are like angels. 

Second: I am sorry I often don't reply on comments and PM's- besides flashbacks and all I have huge anxiety. I'm afraid I will say stupid things and you will hate me ( right now my palms are sweating like crazy while typing this)

I want to ask you guys something ( I think I already asked it once- not sure): How do you deal with triggers? 
I went to work this morning and this guy sitting next to me was smoking Pall Mall - the brand I used to smoke ( i don't smoke anymore- I smoked for 6 years though), especially when I was with my ex-boyfriend J and my ex-ex-boyfriend E ( who raped me when I was with my ex-boyfriend J). I don't know how to explain- it's new to me that something like smoke triggers. It seems like the smell is linked to the time I spend with my exes and especially the rape. 
I was a different person. I don't know... I'm sorry. It just feels weird. My whole body is feeling weird since the trigger.

I'm wondering if I could fast while taking Wellbutrin. Do you have any experience or articles? I found one site who said it couldnt do harm, others said it could. Two girls did it and said it went well.

But I need to know some details: 
HOW can I be sitting one moment with him kissing my neck, me fighting him and the next he is on top of me and my clothes are shoveled up and to the side and all... how can you do that when a girl is fighting for her life? Also: HOW is it physically possible if I'm laying on my back with my pants on my knees... how can he put his junk in me? how can he have that angle and space to do so?! How can he BE there when I'm having my pants on?!
How can he hold me down when I'm fighting so hard and kicking him? 

I dont understand it, I don't know how it's possible

My (21F) psychologist asked why I couldn't say 'rape' out loud, I told her I can say he 'went over me', but 'rape' is just too heavy. It makes the situation harder to handle. 

Then my other therapist asked me what this feeling was what I am feeling and why I wouldn't explain to her - How can I explain this feeling? I can write it, I can say it to you guys because you have been there and I think you understand me better- 

How do you explain the feeling of flashbacks - of feeling the rape AT THIS MOMENT- how do you explain you want to cut yourself because the pain is better then feeling him IN you the whole fucking day? How do you explain I can feel his hands touching me RIGHT NOW. my neck - can't breathe, my breasts, my... parts. I feel him in me, like... I can feel him... pounding.... in me. I feel his thing... in me. My belly hurts physically because of it!

How can I explain without dying from pain and shame and... it's so personal, so close... why would they want to know anyway? 
It hurts so much to only thinking about it, why can't I push it away? WHY do i have to feel it? I don't want to feel it...

So I posted this yesterday with the wrong episide- i'm sorry. This is the right one! 

Avoid this episode if you have triggers when looking scenes about rape. It wasnt fun, went full blown flashback- wouldve been Nice to know. ( so maybe upvote to get this seen by as many people as possible?)
I Just wanted to share this, maybe I can spare someone a flashback....

user/arizonaapple checked the episode again to get all the moments so you can skip it - thanks arizonaapple!
*""I went back to check episode 7, and I don't think that's the right one. It's episode 10, I will break it down for you:
22:36 - 23:39: questionable consent, do not watch
56:05 - end of episode: two different accounts of rape put one after the other, because the scenes were put right next to each other it is hard to watch
Honestly, you can skip these scenes and still understand the rest of the season. The gist is that this particular character is sexually abused, 2 are flashbacks (this may get confusing when you watch, but it's not by her boyfriend it's by another person that I think I left off screen in the times) and 1 is in current time and it's pretty obvious who abuses her.
I will admit that there are themes of rape/revenge (think Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) after this episode, but there's no more pop-up explicit rape scenes. There is just talk about it, and whether there should be revenge and ""rape him back."" If you want to know about that scene too, let me know and i'll give you the times if that can be a possible trigger (that part didn't bother me, but I don't know about you)""*

I am totally confused again. Could you give me some answers?

1) How do you get your vitamins and minerals? I think you need very much, but I don't think you will get much because you eat a lot of fat  ( I'm trying to figure out if there are a lot vitamins/ minerals in fat) 
I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but I really don't get it. I'm afraid I'm starving myself with the lack of nutrients

2) Do you count calories? Yes/No and why? 
They say calories in = calories out, but in fat are a lot of calories ( nuts! Macadamia nuts holy crap) and now I'm stuck.

3) Do you have any good vegan-keto apps / an app where you can fill in your own macro's? Which also takes care of the micro's? ( I have a windows phone - Nokia Lumia 630) 

4) Do you know great vegetables/fruit with lots of fat and protein but not many carbs? ( I don't do tofu/soy etc) 
I followed my food for a week now and I am very low in protein and I need to push up my fat intake. My carbs are the highest ( because fruit and veggies; somehow I pick te ones with a lot of carbs and no/less protein and fat)

I know I am naive, and I want people to have a 3rd/4th/5th chance, I want to believe in the good-side of people, even this person. Did I deserve it?

I want to record this conversation so I can listen it back on times when I feel that I did something wrong and feel depressed, and I want this all to be over. I still have flashbacks and nightmares every night ( it happened roughly two and a half years ago), I don't want to think of him, so I hope when I see him and hear his story, I can let it go and get rest.

If you have ANY tips/ suggestions - TELL ME!

I am a 21 year old female who was once a christian, but after so much negativity kind of became an atheist. 

I thought the whole core of believing was being kind, but they showed me that if I didn't do this or that that I would burn in hell. No thanks, I don't want to burn in hell for doing something I think is good

I never saw Islam as something good ( just as the rest of all the religions) - so tell me something awesome about your believe?

PTSD,"Hi guys,

I'm ( 21F) new here on this sub. As a sort-backstory: I was raped by my already ex-boyfriend when I was 18. He was my first real boyfriend and the first man I slept with.

Yesterday I had my 500th ( feels like it) EMDR session. I am starting to believe it's not my fault. He was a dick throughout the few months we were together. 
* He told me I was too fat/ stupid and ugly
* when I asked him to help with my economics home-work he laughed HARD that I did not understand it 
* when I was at my then-boyfriend's place ( they were friends) he came to visit. My boyfriend and I were writing an post to find a chick for a threesome, he read the description and said in my face 'well.. you are NOT 'fluffy'! How about FAT!?', my then boyfriend kicked him out immediately.
* When I was sick ( I had pfeiffer so I stayed in bed for days) he came to visit at my boyfriends place. My boyfriend went to the university, but my ex stayed a little longer. He started up my boyfriends computer, sat down at his desk, put on some porn and started to do himself! ( while I was laying in bed in the same room)

those are just the ones I can think of right now. He was a dick. He did really hurtful things and the rape... it was NOT my fault. He started to touch me, I said 'no', he went on, he let me struggle and fight, and went on while I was 'gone'/ blacked out/ frozen.
He said he could see it i my eyes that I didn't want to 'but my fighting was SO weak, it didn't mean anything'

An other thing: One of my therapists told me Monday that when something traumatizing happens and we freeze ( also called 'playing dead'), that your heart rate goes from VERY fast ( fighting/adrenaline) to  very slow, your body is colder and stiff. So his argument that he didn't 'knew'...

How could you NOT know the girl you are on top of and IN, goes stiff and cold and shit?! 

He is a bitch. My body tried to protect itself. I did not do anything wrong. HE DID. He is the asshole, not me. And I did not provoke it either! 

Thanks for letting me rant!

PTSD,"hi guys,

Sunday I (21F) went to the police station to ask for information, he asked for my story and I told him that ( I was nervous: male officer around the 25)

yesterday I got an appointment with two woman from the 'assault&rape departement' and I did my story again. scary afraid ( I cried the day before for like an hour and the day itself was horrible.
I did my story and they asked questions I just didn't know anymore ( what exact date was it / why don't you know how you went from his place to your boyfriends') it was hard. Like they did not believe me. It hurt.

They said that I can go on and file a report - they will go on if I ask them to - but they say the chance of him getting away is pretty big. Then I just shut down. He's getting away. I have skype-logs and mails where he is CONFESSING, but... I don't have ripped clothes, don't have marks anymore, don't have his cum dripping down my cunt, am instable as fuck and do have fucking gaps in my memorie. They told me I could probably not handle the whole process because the questions are going to be hard and detailed. That my memorie is to bad.

I'm sad. I'm angry. My boyfriend waited outside, when we went in the car I started bawling my eyes out and sceaming like crazy. Something about that he's getting away and that I'm going to kill myself or him. Went to take a bath when we were home.
It's morning now and the first thing I thought when I woke up was 'he's getting away'

I'm broken. My dad said it may be better to focus in MY life first, and report later. ( I'm now 21 I'll have till I'm 30-ish) It hurts. I have to live with this. I dropped out of school because I couldn't handle the pain anymore- couldn't concentrate - my job also fired me a while after that. I'm home. alone. Only when I have therapy... I'm done

PTSD,"Hi guys,

what would you do? 
( he was my ex-ex boyfriend at the time I was 18- female- he was 21) 

he says he's sorry and that he would slap himself if he could, turn back time and say 'dude, you don't know how much you are going to hurt her' ( exact words). I asked him a few things to get back memories for the EMDR and I think it will help me recover, he answered. He mailed me one time saying he would cover one of my therapy-sessions with or without him ( which I turned down- I'm NOT going anywhere with him) 

Am I soulless and stupid if I still want to report him? He said he's sorry... but I still want to give him back part of the pain he has given me. Also: will it reduce the punishment now that he said that? 

Thanks again guys, you are my heroes!

PTSD,"I just got to share this. Last night I went to bed earlier than my boyfriend and I had a nightmare for like an hour or so ( since I went to bed till he woke me up) and it was terror.

I relived every fucking detail. and I remembered that it was true, what happened in the nightmare. It happened. he pinned me down, he did not forced me to get undressed before I laid on the bed, he slid my jeans and underwear down, my tshirt up and my bra down when I laid on his fucking mattress. That's how it went! He used his fucking zipper. That's why I was gone SO FAST after it all happened...

What's more is that I was laying different than I thought. I laid on his two mattresses, with my head to his window and my feet to the desk, not wall to wall ( his mattress was as long as his room was- if you understand what I mean) 

I just snapped in that fucking moment. i saw my jeans down, my shoes and I did not understand because I thought they were off but they WERENT

PTSD,"EMDR, nightmares and triggers are like being raped all over again. Reliving everything, the smell, your thoughts: every little detail. 

People telling you to 'get over it' and say 'it's too easy an excuse' are saying I have to stop crying, wash the cum out of my jayjay, put a bracelet on my wrist so you cant see the traces he left on me. They are saying I cant be in shock or grieve about what just happened: because it just happened ALL OVER AGAIN IN MY HEAD. I'm too busy plotting why me and my end to 'just get over it'. I'm in shock. Again. Because I felt everything. Again. Telling me to 'move on' is like saying to a crippled man he has to walk, just when he got ran over by a truck. Telling a soldier not to cry because he saw his friend die in an accident, not to have nightmares.

I am 21 years old, but I do not know much about make-up. When I was younger I walked around like a clown because I did not know how to use make-up and now I just use none, but I really want to.

So right now I just clean my face with water and after that I put some jojoba-oil. No make-up, until today. I bought Earth's beauty mascara, eyeliner and a lipstick. I did not bother to look at foundation and that kind of stuff, but now I am wondering... should I wear foundation-conceiler-primer ( what is everything anyway?) my skin is very uneven, many pimples if I eat a little bit of chocolate, oily and a warm reddish-pink undertone.

what would you advice me doing before putting on my new mascara, eyeliner and lipstick?

PTSD,"So, I (21F) am in a group-therapy thing which is 3 days a week, from 9am till 3 pm ( or at least: that's what my planning says- sessions get canceled a lot!) Just fyi: we have creative-therapy, sport therapy, social-ability lessons and much more. I also have one appointment with a psychologist once a week and still a few EMDR-sessions.

since the start (begin september) the whole therapy has been rocky. The therapists are late or they don't show up, the first 2 weeks I have been in this 'group' with only one other girl ( Dani) who was absent a lot. Then there was this girl (Audrey) who was not my kind of person, a week after that there was this shy awesome girl ( Eva), she became my friend. After a few weeks there was this other girl ( Free) and we became friends too. 

Now Audrey has left, which I don't mind at all, Dani is still absent A LOT, Eva has left without saying ANYTHING last week and today was Free's last day and the start with a guy.

So here I am, the therapists are lazy, late and pretty much not caring a fuck ( we had this 'artsy-hour where we could make stuff and the therapist - she was a substitute- sat at an other table and sat there what's-apping or god knows what the whole 2 hours!!!) , my two 'friends' I made at therapy are gone and I am pretty down.

They really don't give a fuck. Last week Free brought her suicide-letter with her and they were like 'oh, poor you, now go on with the program, bye!' They are understaffed, I know. We have way too less participants, I know... but... is it too much to ask to get proper help? 

I don't know what to do anymore. Thursday I have an appointment with my parents and the therapists to talk about my progress. I think I want to quit, but then what? I'm not ready to start a study again or work, it's way to scary. I want to work on myself a little while longer, but just not like this...

I am a 20 y/o female, living together with my boyfriend and two kittens. I have been raped two years ago. I am in therapy and I am doing EMDR.

The EMDR helps a lot, I used to wear a sweater and jeans all the time, no make-up, no pretty boots. I want to be able to wear a skirt or being able to feel pretty without the feeling of men looking at me and want to hurt me all the time. I gained pretty much weight, I guess to eat my emotions and to keep people at a distance.

I want to be able being in a room with a guy without freaking out, I want to wear a dress without being scared...

I want to be me again. The girl who dresses the way she wants ( not even slutty), I want to be able to love myself, but still all I see when I look in the mirror is a blob of fat, a scared little fat girl. Unlovable, filthy, used...

PTSD,"Hi guys,

This happened yesterday when I (20F) went home from an appointment with my psychiatrist. I just need to write this down, maybe you guys have something useful to say, maybe something uplifting, maybe your own story; tell me.

*backstory: I was raped when I was 18 years old by my already-ex-boyfriend*

I had to go by bike to the train and then walk for half an hour after the psych. The train was full, I sat down next to a guy, opposite of me there were sitting two guys. I felt scared, really scared. Focussing on my music, but my mind was tripping. 

Okay, finally there, now I just have to walk home- You can do this shit! ... So many people, so many MEN. I wanted to sit down on the street and curl up in a ball and cry REALLY hard. I was SO fucking afraid. I what'sapped my boyfriend that I was tripping out and he called my dad's girlfriend to talk to me ( my man was busy at work) and she guided me home safely, distracting me.

I know these guys didn't do anything and the chance I will see my ex again is very very nihil, but at that point it's my fear taking over. 
I think if I ever see my ex again I will punch him in the nuts and/or break his nose OR I will freeze in fear. My boyfriend is uber-supportive, he is always there for me and if he triggers me ( which happens very often, sadly enough), he stops/walks away or hugs me.

I am in therapy ( 9AM till 3 PM) 3 days a week, once a week an appointment with my psychologist and once a week EMDR, for 4/5 sessions.

I can't lose weight if I don't feel safe...

Tuesday I (20F) had my first appointment with the EMDR-therapist. She asked me if I had clear pictures of the rape (2 years ago). I did not. So when I got home that day I went on Skype, searched for my rapist- ex boyfriend and asked him if he wanted to tell me what happened in detail. He did. I remembered everything I blocked.( I froze and shut down/out- My body was laying there, but my mind was gone) Everything made sense.
I almost had to puke. nauseated. sad. 

Since then I'm feeling down. Coming Tuesday the EMDR starts and I have the 'pictures' in my head REAL clear. almost too clear. it hurts.

How can someone do that? How can someone take a piece of you like that? How can he go on with his life, but I am struggling every day to keep myself together?! I am in pieces. it hurts.

hi guys,

I(20F) am stressed out and depressed. I'm in therapy for 3 days a week ( since a month now) and I got a degree in 'waitressing'. I was studying to become a Hotel/Restaurant manager, but things got out of hand and I left school with this degree.

I don't know what I want from life. I live together with my boyfriend and our kittens and I can live on the support from my parents ( I was fired at my job as barkeeper/waitress after I got lyme and had to stay in bed for 2 months), but it's quite hard.

Right now I have the opportunity to work on myself, and I am doing that, but it's hard. I want to be ready to study again or work. The therapy makes me sad and depressed because it takes everything I put away to the surface. I want to kill myself. Seriously. (I am diagnosed with depression, add, PTSD- rape)

I know I should take this time to focus on my shit, but I struggle with earning money ( I can't get a job because: WHO WOULD WANT ME?) and I need to take care of our household, which is hard for me as well.

[when I saw a customer die in front of me while working behind the bar at work- he had a heart attack - she said literally this ""oh, I had that once.

I wrote a letter which I read out loud to her. My boyfriend was there to support me. I read it with a stammering voice and you could hear me almost break down in tears, she just said without any emotion ( like she was asking a recipe from the cashier) 'oh, and now?' **WHAT?!** ( The letter had every aspect of the story and also how I felt after that and how I would like how they reacted towards me and how they could get help for themselves, because it would not be easy for them as well)

I was a few minutes late at going home (9 PM) from my friends, within 10 minutes she was there, dragging me home. ( I was 17/18 back then) She went through my drawers when I was 18 ( the one behind my bed where she had to push away the bed to find the drawers) and saw my sexy-toys. When I came home she confronted me with 'why I had those ""pleasure-toys"" laying in my drawer"" DAFUCK are you doing in my drawers?! It's not like you wash and iron my clothes anymore. It's not that you cleaned my room anymore.

At the end of the conversation, she said: ""I'm glad I finally know the truth you were hiding from me""

I'm sorry?! ""the TRUTH... I was HIDING"" ?!

She also told me she thought I was a cam-girl and/or putting pictures of myself on the web ""because I acted sneaky"" and ""always sat with my laptop in bed"" ( I loved skyping/chatting- cheaper then SMS- with my love before going to sleep, fuck me right?)  

When I was 19 I went on my own in a student-house, thanks to my dad who saw that I had to get out of there. Right now I am living together with my boyfriend and our kitties.

PTSD,"I (20F) was fed up with keeping this burden for myself. I wanted them to know. ( it happend around 2 years ago). These were the things I did: 

**1) I thought A LOT about it** 
Right now I am in therapy 3 days a week/ 8 hours a day, so I had lots of time thinking about what happened ( I was not forced to think about it: it just happened) I realized *I did not do ANYTHING wrong* yes, I was naive, but that did not give him the right. That was a huge step. I figured out that it affects me so much more then I thought.

**2) I asked my rapist ( ex-boyfried) to write down what he knew what happened so I could check if I were not crazy ( this was scary as fuck!) but then I knew: this guy really really did rape me and was wrong to do it! ( Skype-chat) I copied that chat into a document so I can read it over if I need/ want to ( if I feel like I was wrong or 'deserved it') 

**3) I wrote down what happend with his responses next to it. It really made things clear.

**4) I thought a lot about it and decided it was time to tell people
I wanted to make an army-gang of the guys in my life who would fuck him over. I would NEVER do that, but it was an entertaining thought. I figured I was going to tell one of my older brothers, because he needed to be there when I told my dad and I wanted to know how he would react... I read a story out loud to them. Needed to get it on paper so I could carry on or my awesome boyfriend could continue.

**REACTIONS**

*my brother*: (Thursday) He sat there, staring, for what feels like HOURS. 'what are you thinking, bro?' 'hmmm?' He was having a conversation in his head I think. He looked like his head processed this VERY slowly. first thing he said? 'he's such a RAT! I am sorry for you'. Then he went on eating a box of candy ( he NEVER eats candy, but today, he ate half a box), he cried. It was very hard for me to deal with his reaction, because I did not think he would just stare for a really long time. He sat there processing for an hour I think, then he went away. I got a text saying he was proud of me for telling him and he would be here when I need him.

*my best friend* ( thursday evening): She wanted to know how things were on therapy, so I decided just to throw it out so I could also call her if I needed her. She and her boyfriend said they were shocked and they wanted to kill him.

*my father's girlfriend/step-mom*: (Friday) I texted her Thursday night that I felt awful, she said she would come by friday to do something fun. She asked me why I felt bad and I figured that if I tell her first, she could prepare my dad. I wrote the story again. She was processing it for a short time. 'I knew it. I knew something happened with that guy. You changed so much. It explains so much. Rat' Then we sat there for a while, she hugged me and said i was strong for telling her. Then we went for pancakes and for a walk in the forrest :D 

*My father* (Saturday): Figured since I have told my dad's girlfriend, that I could also tell my dad now. He needed to know this since he touched my neck so many times with me cringing. His girlfriend told him what happened before I arrived with my boyfriend. She said I grabbed a bottle of water and went to sit outside for god knows how long, staring. So when I did my story, he only stared for a couple of minutes, his eyes red and teary, 'If you told me a few years back I would have killed that guy. runt' 
He hugged me and also told me things where so clear now. 

*My 'stepsister'* After telling my dad, my boyfriend and I decided to hang out with my 'stepsister' ( daughter of my fathers girlfriend) and she asked how therapy was and stuff. She studies psychology so I thought; here you have a real-life-case. I told her and her boyfriend. They knew something was off, because of how I changed.

So now I told my brother, my best friend, 'step' mom, dad and 'stepsister'... it feels like something has been lifted of off my shoulders. A veil has been lifted. Like I can be myself around them. I need to tell my other sisters and brother eventually, but having these people already is good for now. Als my mom... but I'm not there yet. I will tell her when my time is ready.

I've grown so much these past years, and the fact that they tell me it's true... makes me feel awesome. Like I WILL get stronger and learn how to deal with it...

PTSD,"Hi guys,

It's going wrong. Since a few months my ex is occupying my every thought and it fucks me over. (He raped me 2 a 3 years ago)

I can't get it out of my mind and system. I have to take a bath every day, sexytime with my SO is out of discussion, I don't feel safe going outside... so today... I stayed inside while I had to go to group therapy. ( it was from 10 am till 3  pm, right now it's 4 pm... so I missed it already) I havent switched my phone on yet. I'm trapped. depressed.

This will not be fixed by drawing, smoking ( which I won't cause I quit), blowing bubbles or taking baths... this can't be done with chocolate.

I want to end it all. I'm serious. I won't because I can't leave my man and our kittens alone in this world, but fucking HELL does that sound like music to my ears. Peace of mind. Rest.

I don't know what to do anymore... I should have gone to therapy today ( 3 days a week/ 5 hours a day), but I just could not leave my bed. I feel worthless. I want to eat chocolate and kill my fucking ex. or myself.

I am worthless and becoming fat. (yey chocolate) What de hell do I have to do to feel normal again? Why can't I feel normal? Why can't I kill myself or my ex? I need rest.

PTSD,"Hi guys,

So I know it's a total personal matter, but I wonder what your reasons were to tell OR not to tell people. This is my list so far:



YES | NO
---|---
1) I want to get it off my chest, it is a burden| 1) I dont want attention
2) I want them to know me| 2) bad reactions
3) I want them to know what they can do and cant do| 3) maybe by telling people, I am ripping the wound open and it will heal slower
4) I want support on bad moments|
5) maybe by telling people, I can let it heal

--------------------------


what were your reasons to tell or not to tell people??

*He forced himself on me, I said ""NO"", touched my neck and kissed me.I fought, but it did not help. I paralyzed, I blanked out/ shut my feelings off, He came. I went home and cried a lot.*

How can I ever tell that to people in a story? How can I say it out loud? 
I want my surroundings to know that part of me. It's been 2 years now.. its killing me. I need support. I need support from my family and friends. I want them to know me, I want them to know why I cringe.

I ( 20 F) havent told anyone but my boyfriend and you guys about the rape ( my ex- ex- boyfriend 2 years ago), but I kind of want to tell my parents, siblings and close friends... I want them to know ME and why I cringe sometimes and what happened...

But I do not want to be judged. I can't handle the pressure of maybe having to tell the story. to explain why I did not kick him in the balls... I'm so afraid they will push me away or tell me 'it's nothing' or even pity me, that would suck as well..

PTSD,"Hi natral-beauties,

I am a 20 year old female, I am now a year or so without make-up and shower gels/shampoos. I love to ask some questions:

**hair**: My hair is naturally thick and oily. I rinse it with soda and apple-cider-vineger. But it stays oily and it smells ( but you can only smell it when you're VERY close) and when I comb my hair I have a LOT hair-loss. Tips are VERY welcome.
bonus question: how do you deal with going to the hairdresser and their chemical-shampoos? I havent been in a year or so, and my hair is splitting...

**face**: my face is naturally oily and acne-ish. I clean it only with water and bicarbonate (soda). Do you have better ideas to clean my face? 

**arm-pits**: I use soda ( I water it a little and smear it under my arms) and a little lavender-oil for this, but I sweat a lot ( and stink sometimes). Do you have better ideas? 

**down THERE** I'm sorry, but I am going to ask: how do you keep it from smelling? I also use soda and lavender for this part ( not in but on)  

**make-up**: I love the feeling of make-up sometimes, but it makes my face itch. Do you have any tips for DIY or all-natural-make up like eyelid-pencil and lipstick? 


Thank you very much!

PTSD,"Hi guys,

This is gonna be the full story. I have posted it once before in /r/rapecounseling, but someone told me I faked it, and that really got to me. Please do not be mean. Some things I remember vivedly, because it's 'so not like me' to do that stuff or I remember because it shocked me. If you just want to know the rape-part... scroll down to Part III: ""No means yes, right?"" ( just saying... if you want to... dunno) 
- - - - - - - --------------------------------------------------

First, let me introduce the people in this event, so you understand better:

Me: I was 18 and something at the event. I am very afraid of people and new-things, I am a bigger girl, I always wanted to look 'atractive' ( wearing a dress/ make-up) , and to be honest... I am more a guy then a girl, cloths-wise.( wearing a hoody and jeans is still my favorite outfit). I had one previous relationship before this story, which was with a girl. I was 14 when we started dating and 17-and-a-few-months when it was over.

Brad: He was 21 at the time, a skinny, long haired-hippy, grayish-blue-green eyes with wild eyebrows and a skin with pimpels. He is like a head shorter then me, was always broke, was a university-drop out, had multiple girlfriends of which I did not knew at the time. He was all about 'open love', and his ultimate house-hold would be more men and women living together and all fucking each other ( including the 18+ children. Yes. For real) 

David: He was 20 at the time, he had big curly hair, fierce blue eyes and glasses. He was half-a-head shorter then me, but he was a little chubbier then Brad. ( though I was still bigger then him), he studied and did a lot for his student-club where he went to 3 to 4 times in a week. He was a bit richer then me at the time (I still lived with my mom, he and Brad lived on dorms) 

Luke: Luke was a friend of David and Brad. He studied at the same university, was a member of the same student-club as David. He was 23 at the time ( if I recall correctly), he was a cute-looking guy, but also pretty handsome. He trained, which you could easily tell. He was a head taller then me, and he could easily lift me up. He had brown hair and brown eyes.

Kimberly: Kim was Luke's girlfriend of over 4 years, they were high-school sweethearts. She was a tall, skinny, medium-length-blonde-haired-blue-eyed woman with a little bit of curves and a B-cup. I think she was also 23 or something like that. Luke and Kimberly have had their shares of threesomes, gangbangs and all that jazz.
- - - - - - - - - - 
**Part I: the party** 
I ( 18, back then) was single for over a year when I met Brad online on a dating/meeting site. He was so open and free, I really admired that. He was so diffrent from me, that's why I was attracted to him. He did not care about the opinion of others, he just did the things he wanted to do. I on the other hand am scared shitless for having the wrong opinion and such. We had a relationship close to a month when I got invited to a Queensday party with his friends. Normally I would kindly decline, but I was brave. We stood there at the party in the sun, me and David -who was very nervous and fidgetting with something- were smoking some cigarettes. I think that's when David got a crush on me. I saw him as a boring, but cute-pretty-small- no bearded/manliness-kind-of-guy. Like he could be my best male friend. We were dancig around when they decided to do MDMA. They were rolling hard when David and I decided to join them ( we were pretty scared and insecure. We'd only done some weed and hasj back then). I remember how the music got to me, ow I was one with the music. Somewhere along the time we formed a cuddle-puddle on the grass in the burning sun. There  were other groups who were tripping and bouncing on various drugs all around us. And there were policemen, sitting 5 meters in front of us, not giving a fuck about what we smoked or did. We were all laying on top of each other. I was still clinging to Brad, but he wanted to enjoy his trip by himself so he excused himself and went for a walk. I wanted to be hugged and searched for company in the arms of David, Luke and Kimberly. This hugging transisioned to kissing. I looked at Luke and saw something in him I had not seen in him and kissed him full on his mouth. With toungue. Kimberly and David looked at us, then looked at each other and started kissing as well. I remeber Kimberly not liking being kissed by David so I scootched in between them and started kissing Kimberly. Somewhere along this time Brad came back and there has formed a que against the fence we were close nearby, just staring at us and jelling things. There were numerous of guys asking if they could join us and one offered his appartement to us 'yeah, I got an appartement two blocks down the road, if you want some privacy' we did not. We got a lot of water and the guys started to trow water over eachother and stroke our ( Kim and my) arms with their wet hands, which gave us the feeling we were having orgasms. We started stroking the bellies of the guys and their arms and heads. Pre-orgy kind of event. 

In the train back to the guys' city I saw how big Luke's pupils were and we kissed and hugged. Strangers were looking their eyes out and were weirded out by us. When we arrived at our city, we kissed each other goodbye ( full on tongue and hands and all), Brad and I stayed at the station for a while to cool down. I did not knew how I got on that bench at the station. Or what happened at the party. Or how we went to the party. Those goodbye-kisses felt like a dream. I could not recall acually doing that. 
- - - - - - - - 
**Part II: After-party**
The next week I was experiencing the 'afterglow'. Feeling drained, tired but somehow very happy.
The day after the party we decided to meet for dinner. It was a bit awkward, but somehow I was still really bold. I kissed them on the lips when we said our hi and goodbyes. After dinner I remember standing against the wall with David pressed against me, panting in my ear. I ran to Brad and asked with a red head if I could do stuff with David, surely he was fine with it. Entering the room, I took my clothes off like they were on fire and we had sex. He was a lot bigger than Brad ( who was my first boyfriend), and with the after-glow I just could not keep quite. When we were done we went to take a shower and we heared a moan coming out of his flatmate's room- who wasnt there. Kim sat there with the other guys sucking her nipples. We decided to take the party to David's room, and I started getting licked and fisted by Brad. In the corner of my eye I saw Kim giving head to Luke and jumped of off bed next to Kim and started sucking and licking his pole together with Kim. Sometimes taking a break and kissing her. David got dressed and lighted a cigarette on the balcony, he was sad about me having sex with them ( I heard later, but I was Brad's girl back then). The guys stopped when we heared David's roomate coming home, but Kim and I were still going strong, in full vieuw before the roommate ( which I did not care about back then, later I did care. A lot) 
The day after I went with Brad and Luke to a student-party. I could not keep my hands of off Luke and he could barely do the same. I asked Brad if Luke could come back home and he said he would want to so badly, but he could not. I went home with Brad, all sad and horny, Brad wanted to go home and sleep. I texted a lot 'sexy and persuading' texts with Luke, and he decided to come to Brad and me. It was somewhere over midnight and it was raining hard. I opened the door topless and in my underwear ( while Brad had three male flatmates living with him- I was bold and still having the after glow), Brad started to touch me as soon as we were in his room and started the threeway. It was amazing. I heared them talking about me, but I was so far away... it was so hot. Then Brad wanted to sleep and Luke and I went at it for a while, then he went home and I slept great.
- - - - - - - - 
**Part III: ""No means yes, right?""** 
We had a lot amazing four-ways/ threesomes over time. As time passed by Brad and I got into more fights and my bond with David became stronger. Since Queensday I had casual sex with David, which Brad was fine with. One evening I was at David's and I felt what I did not felt with Brad... mutual-connection and love. I knew David felt the same. I went 'home' to Brad that night and told him about the connection and love. He was insanely jealous. He wanted to have sex, but I never wanted sex without the connection again. One night we were in the shower and he told me I was too fat, ugly and stupid for him. ( this is translated from what he said. He probably told me 'I was not his type, because I am very large and we are not on the same page' or something like that), I packed my stuff and went to David. ( which was a 20 minute walk at 2 AM) 

One day ( more then 3 weeks after Queensday: So no I was not under influence of that one time I used MDMA ) I went to Brad to tell him I did not wanted to be his girlfriend ( or fuckbuddy, for him) anymore. I came in and took my sweater off. He said “oh, already getting naked?!” with a creepy grin. I told him that I could not be his girl anymore and that I did not wanted to have sex anymore, but somehow something snapped in his head. He was horny and did not wanted to accept that I did not wanted to have sex with him anymore. “So I started lying to myself that you still wanted to have sex with me, secretly. I started to kiss you and seduce you, while you told me you did not wanted that. I kept going on, while checking on you how much you stuggeled and fought. I lied to myself again that you secretly did wanted to have sex with me, because you did not fight and struggled hard enough, in my opinion. After a while you stopped fighting and resenting and I continued fucking you until I came. After that we might have said some things but you left quickly”  ( he literatly told me this) 'I did not struggle and fought hard enough' excuse me?! I stopped fighting because I figured it would be over sooner, I blocked out any emotion, somehow. I was blanc, empty. Tried not to feel. He told me he could see it in my eyes that I did not wanted it, I even told him to stop ( his reply: “No means yes, right”) but he just did not care. I went home that night feeling cheap, used, filthy. I felt like a worthless piece of shit. I don't know if I ever told David what happened, because I did not want to jeopardize their friendship and my relationship with David. Though since that night...things never were the same again. 

I got weird. Clinging on to David, suspecting him of cheating, wanting to be with him all the time. Being afraid of guys. My relationship with David was practically over when Brad raped me. It lasted a long and hard month after the incident.

**Part V: Now** 

Now I am living with my boyfriend (24) and our two kitties. I still have vicious dreams about being raped, I sometimes have trouble with sexytime, and I have enormous trust issues. But I love my man and he loves me. He helps me a lot. when I go 'blanc' during sexy time he stops, he wants to know my opinion and... I just totally love him.

PTSD,"Hi guys,

I (20F) have been raped by my ex-boyfriend when I was 18. I have days and moments when I am depressed, I have my moments when sexytime goes wrong and I end up crying in my boyfriends (24) arms ( we live together)

Do you guys have any tips or tricks to deal with it? I go to therapy ( they diagnosed me with PTSD, but that's not the only thing why I am there), only my boyfriend knows. I told my dad a few weeks ago about my nightmares ( being raped) and he asked if it has ever happened to me, I said no. 

I do not want to be pitied. I still think it's my fault though somewhere I know it is not. I still want to hurt him really bad even though he told me he regretted it since he knew he fucked me up this bad.

PTSD,"Hi guys,

I just need to get this out of me. I had an appointment wednesday with the health facility ( bare with me, I am not a native english-speaker) to switch companies, because the psychologist I am with now is located further away. ( 1,5 hour by public transportation) So I had this intake with an other company, because it's nearby and they offer a program my psychologist right now does not do.

My mom went with me to the intake ( I am a 20 year old female, I'm just done with my study) and they were digging in my head and asking questions. My mom said I worded everything that's going on with me very well, but I don't know. They were with the two of them, it scared me. 

The guy asked 'okay, so I have this image of you and tell me if I am wrong: You are just watching other people from a distance and wish you could be like that. Do stuff they do and so on' and he was right. 
I am done with my study for 2 months now, I have no job and I am terrified to go outside. I have no hobbies. ( because... why would I? What's the point? What do I like to do?) I do live together with my boyfriend and 2 kitties, so I do need to take care of them, take care of the laundry, make food and clean the house... but my life just has no fucking meaning.

I might be going to do the program with them, which is a therapy-group from 17- 24 years old when we are going to do some individual therapy,, group therapy and sports. I fucking hate sports. But I am lifting weights and running the last couple of weeks. the guy in the interview was like: 'Do you sport?' with a tone like 'I bet you don't, you fatty' and I just said that I indeed did not do sports. but I do. sometimes.

My house is a mess. My head is a mess. The weather sucks and I just want to cry and die. I feel so alone. I am afraid of people. Afraid I will never do an important study or have a job or something. I don't want to live off of my parent's money for ever.

I am afraid for the program. What if the people will hate me? What if it's just like school? bullies, useless talks. populair kids, lunching in the bathroom-stalls. I can't eat if other people are there. I am so fucking afraid. I can't work with people. Group-sessions are not my thing. what if they hate me? God. I don't want to go. But I have to. I can't live like this. Alone.

I'm sad.


TL;DR emotions. a lot. Feel worthless and stupid. Don't know what to do.

- stay with my therapist
- leave my therapist and start the group therapy
- stay with my therapist and figure something out with home-care stuff ( that they help organizing your home and budget and stuff)  and work with that

"" Hurray! 10 days :D 

Things that are happening: 
* My acne is gone. ( It was VERY bad!)
* My skin is smooth as fuck ( over my whole body)
* My mind is clearer
* I am losing weight ( 9 kilos/ 19.8 pounds so far)
* I am getting myself disciplined
* I am not depressed, stressed etc as much as I used to
* I am stronger
Edit: * my boobs are smaller! They don't wiggle around so much anymore while exercising :D

I am again trying to edit some photos to it. To Y'all: **If I can do it: YOU CAN DO IT!** I used to be fat, depressed, sad etc. Now I still have break downs- but they are smaller. I am still quite big- but smaller and I am not depressed anymore! I am even starting to like sporting! ( lifting weights, yoga)

PTSD,"Has anyone successfully sued Stats Can for harassment?

Statistics Canada has been harassing us to fill out a survey, calling several times per day and refusing to stop even though we have requested them to stop calling several times now.

This is not a census, which people are legally required to complete (or face jail time or fines as a consequence). The agent on the phone is insisting the survey is mandatory, but it even states on the documentation itself that the survey is voluntary (and all we need to do to opt out is send them a letter explaining why we don't want to take part, which is still a way of gaining information and is a waste of our time). 

The harassment is escalating and beginning to aggravate my coworker, the person who is being harassed.

How do I stop Stats Canada from harassing my coworker in the most polite, succinct, legal way possible? Short of hiring a lawyer to sue them for harassment? (which my coworker is not above doing, but.. we'd prefer to avoid that, obv).

I've searched online for others in the same situation and while the harassment is completely illegal on the part of Stats Canada, most people seem to cave in to the harassment once it reaches a rate of 5 or more calls per day (5 calls per day! not even telemarketers are allowed to do that) or worse, actual visits from Stats Canada employees harassing them at their workplaces and residences. 

Stats Can should be ashamed of themselves.

How do I stop the madness?

Thanks!

edit: I just spoke to a Stats Can agent and asked them to go over the Statistical Act with me and they were unable to prove that surveys are mandatory, including the Labour Force Survey.

According to Section 8 of the Statistical Act:

> 8. The Minister may, by order, authorize the obtaining, for a particular purpose, of information, other than information for a census of population or agriculture, on a voluntary basis, but **where such information is requested section 31 does not apply in respect of a refusal or neglect to furnish the information**.

Section 31 deals with sanctions and fines for refusing to participate or for furnishing false information regarding a mandatory CENSUS and as Section 8 states above, does not apply to voluntary surveys (unless you deliberately provide false information, I suppose, which I have no intent of doing).

http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-19/FullText.html

**EDIT UPDATE: I ended up contacting a lawyer and advised Stats Can that we were seeking legal action and Stats Can sent us a letter a couple of weeks later confirming that the Labour Force Survey is voluntary and have since stopped harassing us on the phone. Which seems to have resolved the problem for us, at least.**",hyene

PTSD,"I often need to look up or verify municipal, provincial, federal, and international laws and generally am able to do so online but sometimes the information hasn't been posted or only the shortened version is available, or there are legal disclaimers stating the information may not be valid etc.

So I need to find a hard copy of the law/act in question. I can sometimes find these at the Grand Bibliotheque but the books are often out of date or you have to order them from archives or make an appointment to use them and that alone is very time consuming, never mind the research itself. And I don't get paid to do side research like this. So efficiency would be really helpful.

For example. For today's dilemma I need to verify:

With the federal government, an individual can go back as far as they want and re-file or adjust their tax returns, and the feds are legally obliged to adjust your returns and refund you if necessary, there is no time limit. the federal government is only allowed to go back 6 years. They cannot go back any further as they are restricted by the statute of  limitations on debt in Canada.

From what I understand, it is the same for each province, and in Quebec. An individual can go back as far as they want and adjust their taxes, and if any money is owing the government is obliged to refund it.

The provincial government is withholding a $1000 refund from me right now for 2002-2003 (which I just filed a few weeks ago, long story) and they are refusing to pay it to me claiming that they are not required to refund any monies owing to me because it's been more than 10 years.

I asked for a legal reference and they cited section 10.51 (or 1051) of the Quebec taxation act. I did a quick search online and can't find a reference to that section so I may have to look it up manually.

Like I said, I do this all the time. Constantly looking up legal references for one issue or another, usually relating to clients but in this particular case it's for personal reasons.

So where does the average Montreal resident go when they need to research laws, so they don't have to pay a lawyer (or can't afford a lawyer)? Even if I talk to a lawyer I still want to see the legislative proof (a copy of the law they're citing so I can read it for myself), so legal aid may be able to point me to the law but I'll still need to research it for myself.

Thoughts? Opinions? Thank youu!

edit: it would be BIG TIME helpful if there was an online repository for regional and federal building codes too. building codes, zoning laws, and bylaws.

edit 2: found the tax reference but still would like to verify a hardcopy if possible

PTSD,"I'm female, in my mid 30's, and have recently laid out a budget-plan to repair and improve certain parts of my body that in their current state cause me pain or affect my ability to perform day to day duties. Migraines are a huge problem and jaw surgery should fix it. It's brutal. They have to saw off my upper jaw, move it forward, and screw it back in with titanium plates. Unless a less invasive procedure comes along within the next 2 years. Which would be great, right? Some sort of 3-d printing procedure. Sigh. Wishful thinking. In any case...

I've whipped up a budget and other than dental work (which I'm sure I can get cheaper outside Canada), fixing up my bod shouldn't be too expensive. $30k should cover top notch work. Maybe $50k if I splurge on better surgeons. Luckily (?) I was born with a major birth defect so most surgical costs are covered by health insurance. The $50k pays for work not covered by health insurance, and the work will be done over a period of 2-5 years. So at most $10k per year. Maybe that sounds like a lot? But I am motivated by excruciating migraines. The pain alone is motivation enough to save up enough money to fix the problem permanently. I need upper jaw surgery, orthodontics (again), and a couple of dental implants. It's going to hurt but it should alleviate the pressure causing my migraines, and the constant, ever-present TMJ pain. I'm pretty happy with what I look like, physically, so that's not much of an issue. But jaw surgery and ortho will likely result well, aesthetically. I won't be grumpy all the time, that alone will make me look better.

Next year I'm getting PKR eye surgery (unless something better comes along by then). I would like to have better than 20/20 vision and will look for a surgeon who can offer such, if my eyes can handle it. My eyesight is decent, I wear glasses that I barely need, but things are still blurry more than 20 feet away. I'd like better eyesight.

I am also slightly deaf in one ear. Not too bad but enough that it could gradually become a problem over time. I'm considering getting bluetooth cochlear implants. I can easily wait until a tinier, less invasive version comes out. 5-10 years from now. Not because my hearing is that bad, it's not, but because I want *better than excellent* hearing, and to be able to listen to music and shows and whatnot without using earphones.

I haven't budgeted anything beyond this. But I am also starting to research genetic enhancements and nootropics. Designer drugs and treatments. I've changed my diet and now eat a mostly ketogenic diet. I've recently gone dairy-free as it seems to be the cause of most of my digestion issues. Has also cleared up my skin.

I'm semi-athletic and stay in good shape. I could stand to work out my upper body a couple of days a week. I am for the first time in my life considering getting a gym membership so I have access to a private-ish pool when the public pools are closed, and to work out my upper body. Lower bod is fine. I bicycle everywhere. Couple thousand km/yr at least. Would be more if I lived somewhere more temperate. This is also on the list of self-improvements: moving somewhere that doesn't involve hibernation and cabin-fever.

Over the past year I have taught myself remedial mathematics and am now studying pre-cal. I'm enrolled in a comp-sci undergrad certificate program. I make decent money now as a undesignated accountant. I could certify myself as an accountant and makes ridiculous amounts of money but be bored with my work. I am rather passionate about programming now, so even though it's harder work and will make the same amount of money either way in 5 years, I'm taking the tougher route and sticking with programming because it's, frankly, more interesting and allows for creativity. Also more amenable to remote work. All to say, I am also focusing on improving my vocation. My health. My attitude. In 10 years I should be able to afford more advanced medical procedures and treatments, so I have an eye to the future.

So.. I'm wondering... if anyone else is on the same sort of path, improving not only your emotional and vocational self and your health, but going further to *enhance* what doesn't necessarily need improving, and planning for the future and a possible extended lifespan? 

Does the idea of people doing this freak you out? Or does it make you want to do something similar too?

I need to charge devices on the trip so need to find a solution before I leave.

PTSD,"My ex-boyfriend just filed his taxes for the past few years, he's been working cash jobs and has kept no records or receipts from the people who have paid him. He's made about $15k per year (at most) and in the end doesn't actually owe any taxes, which is great, so that isn't an issue. What I'm wondering is, will CRA or Revenu Quebec ask him to provide proof of income? If he hasn't kept any receipts or records - and doesn't have a bank account - and has basically been living hand-to-mouth for the past decade - what happens in this case? They can investigate him or audit him but his expenses are meager: he's been renting a room for $450/m (now $550/m), he rides an old bike to get around town, he buys groceries every couple of days, and that's about it, he hasn't been living beyond his means by any stretch of the imagination.

He's now working a regular job and everything is being documented, so from here on forward there shouldn't be any problems or red flags... I'm just curious what will happen if revenue agencies ask him for proof of income and he isn't able to provide any?

I've been doing taxes for clients for years and have never come across a case like this so I'm a bit perfluxed. My clients always have receipts and proof of income, I won't claim them otherwise. I'm actually pretty uptight about providing receipts and such, and have never had a problem providing any documentation to revenue agencies so... have no idea what would happen if he's claiming income he can't prove.

Also, because he's made so little income he's actually due refunds, which I'm guessing CRA and Rev Quebec will question too?

I read that marijuana use can elevate estrogen levels and cause men to grow moobs (also read that this is total BS, but judging by my aggressiveness and out-of-whack hormones since i quit, i'm not so sure there isn't something to it...).

I am in the middle of a severe migraine... difficult to write right now.

... I have observed over the past couple of years that my stomach will not digest food when I have a migraine. I'll be starving and will eat something to calm my stomach (empty stomach triggers migraines) but once the migraine has settled in my stomach refuses food (and medication).

What seems to jump start my digestive system and helps alleviate migraine is purging all stomach contents, including bile. For example, I ate a cucumber in the hopes that it would soothe my stomach a few hours ago, and while my stomach readily digested the pulp of the cucumber, I woke up projectile vomiting and could not stop until every last bit of cucumber PEEL had been regurgitated. Tiny little flecks of green and nothing else. This also happens with grapes and tomatoes. My stomach will digest the pulp and puke up the skins. The migraine will sometimes lift immediately after purging tiny bits of whatever particulate is upsetting my stomach.

Just wondering if any of you have noticed a similar response? That your migraines are directly linked to your nutrition and digestion?

California is often ahead of the curve in North America... sounds like an excellent opportunity to re-think and create a new municipal waste water system, starting with the separation of our fresh water supply from human fecal contamination.

If we're smart, the rest of North America will follow your fine example and install dry toilets too. Or some suitable alternative. 


First, we poop in our water supply. Then, we test it for coliform contamination. That's along the lines of feeding someone a gallon of booze and then testing them for alcoholism.

I can see the history books now:

""In the early 21st century, North America experienced severe life-threatening droughts combined with fresh water contamination. This was in large part due to citizens' contaminating their own fresh water supply by defecating in it through the use of ""flush"" toilets, an ancient fresh water system that would flush human waste out of each home into a municipal water treatment facility. This waste water was then inadequately filtered, contaminated with coliform bacteria, and pumped back into the potable water system. This was an extremely inefficient municipal water system that required - and subsequently contaminated - tens of millions of gallons of water per day.""

You know what lead to the fall of the Roman Empire? 

A contaminated municipal water system. 

The wealthiest patrons of Roman society, what we would call the 1% today, had the money to install a (brilliant!) new aqueduct system that would not crack the way ceramic did. Poor folks were still using the old ceramic aqueduct system, which was prone to cracking and leaking. Rich folks thought they were kings of the world, building themselves this new fancy aqueduct system, and they would have been... had they not built the pipes out of LEAD.

It took about 50 years for the effects to become noticeable.. the wealthy Roman nobility loved to bathe, and they spent days lounging in the common bathhouses, weeks, months, YEARS, the local bathhouse back in Roman times was the equivalent of the modern pub today. You went to the bathhouse when you wanted some food and drink while relaxing with your buds. The wealthy had a lot of time to spend doing nothing, and nothing they did, soaking in their common bath with a jug of wine in one hand and fruit in the other.

Slowly, over a couple of decades, one by one, their hair started to fall out. Their finger nails fell off. They started to rant and rave maniacally, their skin red and raw, sloughed off. It was HORRIFIC! The rich refused to share their technology with the poor, so the poor were just fine, they were still using the old ceramic aqueduct system. But the rich! Their selfishness and greed and their love of hanging out in bathhouses with their war mongering cronies - and refusal to install metal piping for the poor - killed many a fine despot and lead to the fall of the Roman Empire.

The most powerful empire in the world DEMOLISHED because rich folks didn't realize they were poisoning themselves with their own fancy lead pipes until it was too late. And yet here we are again, repeating the same mistake.

Blows my freakin' mind, it does.

PTSD,"In case this helps others (because reading your symptoms, causes, and cures certainly helps me..).

Triggers:

- Alcohol
- Cigarette smoke and other smoke
- The smell of bleach, strong perfumes and chemicals 
- Dehydration
- Too much coffee
- Milk, low quality dairy products
- Carrageenan (huge trigger, often listed as ""natural flavour"" in ingredients)
- Mushrooms cultured in manure or bird feces
- Spirulina
- Low quality probiotics
- Sulfites and nitrites
- Saline-injected meat
- Wheat, rice, beans
- Sugar
- EMPTY STOMACH 
- sleep deprivation
- stress
- ovulation, menstruation
- full moon and new moon (i'm assuming it's the fluctuation of gravity between the sun, moon, and earth that alters atmospheric pressure: i also retain water/fingers swell up on those days).
- vitamin B12 and B complex
- st. john's wort, evening primrose oil, sometimes chamomile (photosensitivity caused by these herbs triggers migraine)
- Fluorescent lights
- Stuffy or dusty air
- Cleaning the kitty litter, particularly dusty litters made from clay. Switched to President's Choice GREEN kitty litter (made from corn cobs) and it made a world of difference
- Cats, birds
- Pigeon feces. If I walk through an underpass where pigeons roost, I have to hold my breath because breathing in their dander and poop makes me sick, gives me a migraine.
- Low oxygen or high C02/CO environments (ie. visited a friend's worm room and almost passed out)


-----------------

Things that help:

- methocarbomol
- dimenhydrinate
- diphenhydramine
- almotriptan
- acetaminophen (ibuprofen makes my stomach bleed)
- hot water bottle
- ice packs (often hot water bottle and ice packs simultaneously)
- hot, and sometimes cold, showers with my head continuously under the stream
- keeping my head under water (in the bathtub, pool)
- cannabis
- omega 3 oil
- eleutherococcus 
- PROBIOTICS (good quality multi-strain, Kyo-Dophilus 9 for example)
- Mega doses of Vitamin C
- Garlic
- Cultured dairy, particularly brie and camembert
- Rooibos tea
- Paleo diet
- Neti pot
- Sleep, and lots of it
- Natural sunlight
- Fresh air
- A positive attitude
- Active, healthy lifestyle (I bicycle ~1,000+km/yr)
- Emotionally healthy friends
- MEDITATION and mindfullness
- **SALT WATER**, this is a huge new discovery for me. A cup of hot water with a half teaspoon of sea salt soothes my stomach and often prevents vomiting. sometimes cures migraines within 10 minutes. just drank a cup of salt water 15 minutes ago and migraine reduced dramatically.


Clearly, bacteria plays a big role (probiotics, cultured dairy, carrageenan, spirulina, rooibos, garlic, mushrooms, salt water all connect to the same thing: they either encourage or inhibit microbial growth). 

Would love to hear your symptoms and cures too!

Peace out.

PTSD,"Photo of the motor and belt of the washing machine, which is a Kelvinator Model no. BW205EW1 heavy duty 7 cycle top loading washing machine, mostly likely made between 1980 and 2000. 

http://imgur.com/cWP0w0i

I am having three problems with it:

1. It's not spinning
2. It's not draining
3. Leaks out the bottom when I run the spin cycle (and doesn't spin)

The motor is functioning, nothing is clogging the pump or wrapped around the agitator, the electrical elements are functioning, the timer is fine, there are no holes in the hose. It appears to have a single belt, and that belt feels sturdy and moves smoothly on the wheels, so the belt seems fine. 

From what I've read, if it's not the belt, or the motor, or a clogged fan or agitator, then the next most likely issue would be a broken coupler that needs to be replaced. From what I understand, the coupler attaches to the shaft of the motor. Is this correct?

My other issue is, I can't find a model online that is similar to the washing machine I have, nor can I find a manual or instructions on the Kelvinator brand. 
The motor is on the bottom, which is fairly normal, but it appears the only way I can get to it is by dismantling the entire machine! There are no plates that I can unscrew to access the motor or belts, the bottom and back are two solid plates, and the three white sides are solid sheets too. I can't even *see* the motor properly, nevermind access it right now (with one side off). I can't get to the bottom of the machine without taking it out of the casing. So weird, and frustrating. Taking the machine apart is more complicated than the actual repair seems to be!

In any case. I can't find the coupler on this machine. I have only worked with half a dozen motors so I'm not quite yet familiar enough with them to navigate with ease.

Is there any way to guage where the coupler might be based on that photo alone? Because.. I'm going in blind here and it's a big machine and I'm pretty tiny so... this is a lot of work. (For realz, I think it weighs more than I do and I've already flipped it over a bunch of times, ARMS OF STEEL, frack :D). AAAnyway. Oh. In case it matters: I'm a chick. Would really appreciate your help! Thankss so much!!

TL;DR: WHERE IS THE FREAKIN' COUPLER?! THANK YOU!

PTSD,"My mother had life threatening TB-meningitis when she was a child. Several of her cousins also had TB or had parents with TB and were born deaf or with neurological damage. My brother was born with an ulterior malformation, and I was born with a cleft palate, defects which do not run in the family so we assume were caused by TB and are not genetic.

I have chronic recurring bacterial infections and bacterial meningitis. Right now, for example, I am feverish, my head aches, I am sick to my stomach, and my skin is breaking out in hives. I spend 3 days every two weeks vomiting with a severe migraine (meningitis). I am managing my symptoms. As far as I know, I do not have TB, the main culprits seem to be staph, listeria, and e coli. 

What I'm wondering is whether any of you who have TB infected family lines also suffer from recurrent infections or birth defects.  Or, really, any personal experiences or stories relating to TB, meningitis, septicemia, or chronic bacterial infections. How did your doctors treat your symptoms? Do your infections keep returning?

Since most PTSD is actually *not* from combat would we then need to break it down into ""rape"" and ""child abuse"" and ""robbery"" or ""car accident"" etc? I'm wary of alienating someone with a ""Trauma - Other"" tag, though that could be me being overly cautious, as there can be value in creating a more recognizable way to see the more ""common"" traumas.

PTSD,"Gun trigger warning. 

My nephew was at his best friends house today. They started playing with a gun. His friend said it wasn't loaded so my nephew pulled the trigger, shooting his friend in the head. The other boy died instantly. This is just devastating for every family involved. 

I am aware psychological treatment is immediately necessary. The problem we are facing is that he and his mother live in a very small and remote town in the south. They have limited options and limited financial ability.  I told his mother not to just go to whoever is available and that we need to take this very seriously and make a plan. The therapists available at the local mental health center are poorly trained and do not specialize. I fear their capacity to provide him with appropriate care. The nearest facility with professionals is 2 hours away and my stepsister is not able to make that trip on a regular basis. 

So, my question, is where the world do we go from here? I know some help is better than none but I also don't want him to commit to treatment at a facility that isn't trained in this. This is really serious and I have no doubt the next year of his life will set the tone for his teenage and adult years. 

What does one do for this? Are there online consult options? Would specialists remotely advise a local therapist? And what can my family do to support him at this time? What should we NOT be doing?  My experience with PTSD is that I suffer from it as well, but it was due to prolonged abuse and not immediate trauma so my knowledge of trauma treatment is more limited. I also have a background in neuropsych so I'm aware of the neuroscience aspect of PTSD.

PTSD,"Hello /r/Piano! 

I was trained in classical piano and played for almost 17 years. When I was young I was good. Really good. But in college I gave it up. Lugging around a piano was difficult and I decided to go into science instead of my younger dream of following my music. Well, I recently got married to an amazing drummer who is classically trained in jazz. It's spurred my music passion again and I bought a KORG workstation with 88 weighted keys and I'm ready to tackle that beautiful thing!

I know how to play, and I can play well. My knowledge of anything non classical is extremely limited. I tend to like minor key, very emotional, moving pieces. I also love scales when my hands are all over the place - and the antithesis of that, banging the shit out of some chords is wildly satisfying when I'm in a bad mood! I try to check out piano playlists on Spotify but nothing jumps out at me - it all sounds too simple and peaceful.

I'm rather sick of classical at this point (but still 100% respect it). The only pieces I've learned in the past ten years since I gave up my piano were all of Nobou Uematsu's piano collections from the Final Fantasies. I LOVE them. I LOVE playing them. But I need more! 

I would love to have some recommendations of really satisfying things to play as well as some non-classical pieces I should learn to start seriously playing again. I'm hoping to get enough versatile pieces in my taste to learn so that maybe I can even start writing.

Here goes. I am a single mother - one 21 yo who lives overseas at uni, and a 15 yo with severe anxiety and depression. For much of the past two years, she and I have lived alone and she has stayed with me 98% of the time. She has a relationship with her father, however, she never stays with him and only sees him for lunch/coffee etc. Therefore, ALL of the day-to-day stuff is handled by me. Alone.
Mid last year she was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. She has had several suicide attempts, the last of which was mid-October. She is seeing a psychologist, and a psychiatrist.
Last year was all about going to parties, drinking and smoking weed. This year has been about self-esteem tied up in relationships. I have tried to keep things under control, but I now find myself in a very messy situation with her current boyfriend. She and I get on extremely well and she is always, now, honest with me. I trust her and she trusts me. This is very important to me, and something I value enormously.
The two of them got together in about May of this year. At first, she described him as just a friend. I thought he was gay. And so, she persuaded me to let him stay over from time to time. And naively, I said it was ok. It was a long way from his home to where he was working and as he started work at 6, he appreciated staying much closer to work. I am way too nice and kind to people, and so was sucked in by this idea. I also tend to do things that make her happy, because having a depressed teenager is very draining and tiring, so anything that sees her in a better mood is attractive to me.
Time passed, he spent more and more time here. He was 17 (recently turned 18 but is still quite ""young"") and has an apprenticeship. He's lovely. He works hard, and is very polite and helpful. He mows the lawn, does the dishes, helps out a lot. You could never describe him as lazy. He's been really good to me. I have been sucked in by his niceness in many respects. He does get jealous, and is quite possessive, so it's not all beer and skittles... Mind you, so does she. They are as bad as each other in many respects.
She, however, got more and more depressed and anxious about school. I was stressed and busy at work. She was missing school, sleeping all day, failing to get out of bed and sinking into a very bad place. She missed most of the second half of the year, and has been given status to go into senior high school so that she doesn't have to repeat this year. I had ""rules"" about when he could stay, but over time, they've largely been ignored, and disappeared. I got worn down by the arguing and gave in much of the time. It was easier than fighting. I got so tired of fighting, and remember, I am alone doing this. I have to second-guess myself and make decisions on the fly.
He now pretty much lives here. And I don't know how to get him to leave. I am petrified that she will become suicidal again if he leaves, but obviously, this situation is AWFUL and should never have happened. As I said at the start, I know it's wrong. And believe me, I would go back and change it if I could. But I have been so damn scared of losing my girl, that I have had to make decisions on the run, which have left me in this mess.

PTSD,"I had the opportunity to talk to my school about my experience with  domestic violence and the resulting PTSD. I teach at an all-boys  high school. We were donating money to a charity that works for victims of DV and it was White Ribbon day. 

As part of the healing process, I have gradually been talking more about my experience. On Wednesday, I chose to stand up in front of 1000 boys and tell them that I was what a survivor looked like. That it wasn't something that happened to ""other people"" and that it had an ongoing impact for 25 years.

During my speech, I was crying and shaking, but I kept going and pushed through. There was not a sound in the auditorium. At the end of my speech, they erupted into applause and a spontaneous standing ovation. 

Since then, many people - staff and students and parents - have told me how much what I did mattered. And it did for me too. Because bit by bit, this PTSD is losing its grip on my life and I am making progress.

**EDIT: Text of my speech:**

Today we are recognising White Ribbon day and I am here to talk to you about why this day means so much to me.

For many of you, domestic violence is something you’ve been hearing a lot about, and you may have in your minds an idea of what someone who has survived domestic violence looks like. I would like to say that if you pictured someone like me, you’d be correct. 

When I was just 22, my life was changed forever because of the actions of one man. My partner at the time was violent towards me over the course of a year. That relationship finally ended when he was charged and faced trial. It has taken me a very long time to be able to talk about it, and it is still difficult for me to do so today without being affected. 

As a result of that relationship, I have been living with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 25 years later, I am still affected by what happened to me back then. Just because the violence stops, doesn’t mean the affects don’t last. I will live the rest of my life being affected by his actions. 

I did not come from a background of violence – my family life was happy and safe. I did not expect to find myself in court in the witness box, explaining how the man I loved, and who was supposed to love me, had threatened to kill me. 

Today, people who experience what I did are finding more help and care than ever before from organisations like the Domestic Violence Crisis Service, the AFP and other agencies. And that is because we are talking about this, we are telling our stories, and we are having a conversation in the community that we have to have. For a long time, I was too ashamed to talk about what happened to me. For a long time, I believed it was my fault. But slowly I have come to understand that it was his choice to behave the way he did, and I did not deserve to be treated that way.

My whole life, from that point on, has been different because one person chose violence as a way of dealing with his problems. He made the choice to hurt me, rather than asking for help. I was lucky by comparison to many women. Too many women and children are suffering in their homes because men are choosing to abuse their loved ones. 80 calls are received by ACT policing per day, and 600 nationally per day.

Today, you have the ability to make a promise to help put an end to violence. You can stand up and say that you will not accept/tolerate/or carry out acts of violence towards women. You can make a difference to women of all ages, by saying that it’s not OK. I wish my ex-partner had. I know that I can’t go back and change the past. But you can change the present and the future.

PTSD,"So today in my French class, a kid asked me if accents matter in French. Without thinking too hard,  I replied, ""well Angus, next time how about I leave the G out of your name""...  
Slowly my class of 12 and 13 year old boys broke out in hysterical laughter. My boss walked passed soon after and I had to explain why 25 boys and I were killing ourselves laughing. At least they'll remember the accents! ",jnet

PTSD,"So my daughter has been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 18 months. She moved schools and although some of the bullying stopped at first, things moved back into horrid situations and so her depression and anxiety spiralled. 

Late last year she spent 10 weeks on exchange where she started to go to the gym regularly, and I noticed a HUGE difference in her attitude when she'd been to the gym and then not. I could tell without asking whether it'd been a few days since she'd gone. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. Things have spiralled again, she's REALLY down, suicidal, relationships falling apart left, right and centre. But then a door opens - a school has a sports-based program with a big emphasis on exercise and less on academics. Coupled with no uniform and we decide to give it a go. She got an interview and lo-and-behold, gets a place.

In one short week, the change was obvious and immediate. Much more sport = much more positive. And then last night, she had an issue which got her down, so this morning I expected another day of no-school/sleeping. But no, reluctantly at first, she got up and made it to school late and although back in bed now, is better and mostly ok about what happened. 

Honestly, a month ago, this would have been a week of school-refusal, sleeping, feeling crap, etc. But now, because pretty much every day she does some exercise (with rest days) she is coping with this shitty stuff. 

I can't tell you all how much I see the benefits of exercise in my baby girl. If ever there was a poster-girl for EOOD, she's it. Early days yet I know, but I feel confident for the first time in ages that she's going to be OK.

Hang in there everyone. Keep working at it, keep going, keep exercising. ",jnet
PTSD,"For a long time I have been mostly OK. I have had occasions where incidents would trigger an anxiety attack, but nothing sustained or ongoing. 

Recently my housemate introduced two dogs to the house. The dogs had been with her ex but he no longer wanted to have them. I had been reluctant to have them, because I already have a big, friendly, obedient lab and two cats. I didn't like the idea of two more dogs bu because she has been so good to me and my daughter, and such a good person to have around, I agreed to give it a try. 

The lab loves everybody, only barks when strangers come to the door, and is insanely well behaved. I told my housemate I can't cope with little, yapping dogs. I especially hate being woken at night by barking dogs. Partly because being startled awake is a major trigger, partly because I have a sense of obligation to keep the peace in my neighbourhood and so hate noisy dogs waking people. She assured me they were lovely, good dogs and wouldn't be a problem. 

These dogs have been here for 4 weeks. They have not stopped barking at night and barking at my cats through the glass doors. They have been escaping the yard by digging holes, and so now spend their day locked in a pen-like enclosure on my balcony. One of them climbs out but the other is too fat. I hate them.

In the past 4 weeks, I've had about 4 nights of unbroken sleep. 4 nights where I can sleep without being startled awake, heart racing, adrenaline pumping, scared. Then I'm awake. They bark, I get up, yell at them, they go back to bed, I take ages to sleep. She sleeps through it all because, unlike me, she's a heavy sleeper.

About a week ago I told her they had to go into her room at night. She has been doing that, but then this morning, Easter Sunday, she gets up at 5am, puts them outside. Then the boyfriend gets up at 6.22 and has a shower, then they stomp around, chase the escaped dog, and at 7 leave. The dogs start barking, and so I am left at home, unable to sleep, feeling highly stressed, and thinking about how to get rid of the dogs. 

I'm in a really bad way. She's been such an awesome housemate, but the dogs have totally ruined our relationship. She's looking to move out but finding it hard to get a place with the two dogs. I'm angry and stressed much of the time from lack of sleep, and from the PTSD reactions to being woken. 

Please can anyone give me any suggestions? I am going insane, I cry lots and am becoming a person I used to be but hate being - angry, tired, mean. I'd worked hard to get past it but it feels like everything is coming undone. I am hoping she will find somewhere soon, but I really don't want her to go. I just can't cope with these dogs. ",jnet

PTSD,"I've been running on the treadmill for about 5 months and gradually I've managed to build up the distance and speed. But today, for the first time, I ran 6 ks (just under 4 miles) in just under an hour. It wasn't fast, but at no stage did I slow down or walk. I just kept at it, step by step, until I'd completed 6 laps of the course I was on. I can't tell you how proud I am of me - a 44 yo mother of two who until 6 months ago was out of shape and a couch potato. Today, I'm 9.5 kgs (20 lbs) lighter, I get up at 5.30 and go to the gym or run most mornings and I feel fantastic. I hardly ever drink alcohol anymore and I have so much energy it's ridiculous.

It is possible to change - no matter who you are, how old you are, or how much you tell yourself you can't. You just have to decide to do it. I gave up smoking a few years ago but I didn't have the will power to change everything back then. Now I do. And I love how much better I look and feel.

Never give up, and never underestimate the power you have inside of you to change.

I am feeling so much happier and healthier. I've also just come out of a 6 year relationship which probably wasn't that good for me in the end. Many of the bad habits had been formed while I was in it. I'm looking forward to summer (I'm in Australia) and going to the beach. I hated feeling like a whale.

PTSD,"Has anyone else gotten people inaccurately concluding that you have aspergers when you are under extreme stress? My personality is naturally stoic (I don't show pain easily, there's a lot of emotion under there (definitely a lot of empathy for others) but it doesn't naturally show unless I make a point of revealing it), logical and calm. I also don't always have that much interest naturally in social games, sugarcoating (and on occasion I dislike small talk) though I do put in the effort at these. I find that with the stress of PTSD a lot of my sugarcoating fell/falls by the wayside. I wasn't able to keep up as well with these things as well. I also started to feel a lot of shame and I largely stopped making eye contact with people. I knew it was unlike me and actually felt really embarrassed about that. (I would compare it to being depressed and unable to wash your hair and having people assume that you just don't know to wash your hair or don't know you should wash your hair when in fact you do know to wash your hair and in fact you feel very embarrassed about your unwashed hair and the fact that you just don't have the energy to wash it). 

Because I was grappling with this feeling of betrayal and hopelessness about ever connecting with people and not having them then betray me I also felt like I was at my wits' end with people. I don't know if I should say that I did not want to connect with people but I was definitely avoiding a lot of connection for fear of being betrayed again. I was not glossing over things like I normally did and was not adding all the social niceties and normal politeness because partly I was hurting so much that I didn't have the motivation to do that. 

This led some people  to assume that I had aspergers disorder, instead of seeing that I was really out of it with the PTSD. I was under so much stress and that's why I was acting that way meanwhile people were assuming that the effects of the stress were a natural characteristic of me instead of seeing them for what they were. I mean certain things I can do with my eyes closed, no matter how ill or stressed out I am because I am good at them (like logic and deep thinking), other things where I am not naturally talented at them, those things fall apart more easily when I'm under a lot of stress, in the same way that other people might find the first place their stress shows is with them failing courses for me it's harder to fake with people, negotiate interpersonal situations and get people to do what I want and that's one of the things to go. It doesn't help of course that I'm a woman and being more stoic/calm and logical as a woman is not expected (it is gender non conforming), so people I suppose find my gender non conformity in that sense a bit difficult to interpret and jump to the aspergers' conclusion. Has anyone felt the same ?

PS I think one way to tell the difference between people with aspergers and those with post traumatic stress is that people with aspergers seem a lot more agreeable. They generally seem to want to learn the right rules to follow and put great effort into following the rules whereas those with PTSD may not want to follow the rules because that means risking emotional connection and subsequent betrayal again.

PTSD,"Sometimes I feel like pressure to ""recover"" is making my post traumatic stress worse. I feel like people want me to go back to ""normal"" so that they can skip the step of acknowledging the depth of what I went through and skip the step of acknowledging my bravery in surviving. I don't begrudge people not wanting to deal with my post traumatic stress symptoms (for their own benefit and not my own) but I feel like they want my symptoms to go away so that they can deny what I've been through or just can't be bothered. They don't want to acknowledge the depth of what I've been through because it threatens them (they don't get to feel smug and better than me anymore). I feel like this pushes me to try to suppress and get rid of my feelings. Then I feel like I'm trying to avoid my feelings because I know that other people want to avoid them too and I feel like it's making it worse.

I know that true recovery would look like my bravery in surviving being acknowledged and celebrated even when I no longer have any symptoms. I know that even if I were to recover some people would not want to acknowledge my bravery in surviving, but they would be glad that I was ""functional"" because it's less of a problem for them. Then there would be some people who would acknowledge my bravery in surviving even though they ""didn't have to"". It's not getting rid of any symptoms for them or doing anything to improve their life, in fact it's costing them something to say that to me.

PTSD,"I am hurting. I was betrayed by my closest friend and ended up being abused because of it. Then while I was being abused and was unable to extract myself from the abuse many people judged me as lazy or not trying hard enough. I had people slam doors in my face (literally). That hurt. During that time I was waking up in the morning feeling like putting a gun to my head and I would calm myself down by telling myself, ""This is just post traumatic stress... many people feel this way. It doesn't mean I should actually act on it, it's OK to have the feeling and not act on it."" Meanwhile people were treating me like I was lazy and slamming doors in my face. Then finally they figure out that they misjudged you and they want it go back to normal now and they will treat you like you are normal or something, but it still hurts. I don't know how to classify their sorry. I guess they figured out they evaluated wrong and that's good that they were at least able to get to that point. I paid all the cost of their misjudgement and they are content for me to have paid all the cost and to keep paying it. They are ""sorry"" but really it's no skin off of their back, I've been the one to incur all the losses, what did they incur and what does their sorry mean ? What sacrifices are they making and does it come anything close to the price that I've paid? And I still feel like if I were in the same position again for some reason they would still be misjudging me. It feels hollow. It still hurts.

PTSD,"I'm feeling heartbroken. I've had severe PTSD for many years, it's gotten better to some extent for a few years. 99% of people have no empathy for what I'm going through and I get misjudged, blamed and rejected a lot. When I was doing better, more people were accepting. Some of them then wanted to be ""friends"" and pretend like everything was good, people who had never been there for me before. The question for me then was should I forgive people who were hurtful to me and unaccepting before.  Now unfortunately in spite of my very best efforts my PTSD has been reinvigorated again. A lot of people are now rejecting and judgemental again. It hurts. This is not something that I had or have control over. I tried so hard to not have this flare up again and now it has. I think I see some people's motivations more in this situation and I don't like what I am seeing. I am particularly heartbroken at being misjudged, people act like I'm trying to be like this or I just need some tough love or someone to set down the boundaries. Can't they see that I was attacked again and again and again ? Also people do not care about the years of my life that I've lost while I was struggling to hold it together and doing everything in my power to try to recover. To them it's just like, ""You're one of those people doesn't have family support and who takes longer to get things."" On the other hand someone else said to me a while ago, ""It's our loss that we've lost your contributions over these years that you've been unable to contribute"" and that was healing to me, I believed them and that was what I needed to hear to know that they really cared. 

The thing is that even if I did hypothetically get better again, and people start being ""nice"" again out of wanting my usefulness to them will I then blindly ""trust"" all these selfish people ? Will I then ""forgive"" them and forget about their motivations ? That would feel like a betrayal to myself, how will I deal with that ?

As far as I can see shame is at the root of so much of this disorder and calling myself disordered is only adding to the shame and making it more difficult for me to solve. I remember having an aha moment a while ago that my PTSD symptoms were like battlescars, something that should be a point of pride of my strength and courage in having survived awful things, not something to be ashamed of. I had this sense that they were like a medal for surviving. So I'm dropping the disorder part on my post traumatic stress. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"Please bear with my rant here. I feel like the only people who truly have empathy with me are other survivors of child abuse. Everyone else keeps saying, ""But your parents really care"" or some such BS. And even people who don't say that you can tell that deep down they don't respect you, especially for having the problems that come with PTSD/CPTSD or the problems that your parents create when they abuse you. They are secretly giving themselves points for having been stronger or having been more ingenious at dealing with obstacles. They secretly think that they are better. They have no idea how degrading child abuse is and the toll it takes on a person's mental health. They have no idea how betrayal feels. And this disrespect is not just something out in the ether somewhere, the contempt for survivors not having ""kept it together"" and stayed as ""sane"" as them is a continual drain because all day long I have to interact with people who look at me this way. I feel it and live with subtle but ever draining contempt from people every day. It's like how black people feel trying to explain racism to white people, and how women feel trying to explain sexism to men or how rich people have no idea what it is like to struggle financially.


Even if people ""say"" nothing, you feel the judgement in the way that they look at you, they always think that they deserve to have what they had, they worked hard for it (they worked harder than you is the assumption/implication). They refuse to acknowledge the added struggles that you had to bear. And it's always, ""Why didn't you just hold it together in stressful times and keep going the way that I did ?"" Meanwhile they don't understand the toll that shame takes and the toll that betrayal takes and they don't want to understand or see a need to understand that you had to grapple with so much more than them. In fact they find it threatening to their sense of accomplishment and pride. They need to have their pride that they were so much stronger than you to get their stuff and they feel diminished in acknowledging that they weren't that much stronger, they simply had things a lot easier. People will do anything to avoid giving this ounce of dignity and human respect to a survivor of abuse. And it hurts being treated this way. It takes a toll. You go through the abuse, and then when you get through it you have to live with a society that has contempt for you as a survivor.


I honestly have no problem trying to keep it together and acting like I have it together even when I feel awful or when I feel like I'm not together, but the continual diminishment of the courage and disparagement hard work that it takes for me to do this takes a toll. You feel people's contempt for your hard work. They look at it and it doesn't matter to them, it doesn't exist or they want to make it not exist. But it is hard to keep putting in that level of hard work, it's hard to keep having that motivation with people's diminishment and disparagement of my hard work. It is crazy making because society is constantly sending you the message that, ""No it is not that hard, it's as easy for you as everyone else."" What do you do with your feelings about how much you are struggling through and how much hard work you are putting in when society resolutely and determinedly denies how hard it is for you? When people give you that message it makes you hate yourself. It makes you hate your feelings, it makes you hate your feelings of how hard it is for you. It is incredibly disparaging to you there who are swimming frantically and struggling so hard just to stay afloat. It drains your motivation to try. It shames you, it makes you think that your feelings of exhaustion are wrong and something to be ashamed of. It adds to your burden of making you feel that something is wrong with you for hurting this way and finding it so hard. The continual contempt from people and minimization of the immense hard work we put in just to survive takes a toll and makes it impossible to keep your spirits and motivation up to keep putting in that level of work. Then of course if my motivation falters because society is telling me my hard work doesn't exist, then I'm to blame for not ""keeping it together."" During all of this people continued to enable my father to harass me and enable his abuse. 


The time in my life when I was the most mentally healthy and was the most together was when I had a friend who had been a similar victim of child abuse to me as a child and had experienced the same level of rejection and betrayal from her parents. I am immensely grateful for having had her. I believe that I would not have graduated high school and my life would be in a much worse situation if I hadn't had her. The thing that she gave me was genuine understanding and empathy and she did not scorn me or subtly minimize the abuse like everyone else did. She actually understood and said that it was wrong. For non survivors as a nice starting place it would be great if people would at least admit that they have no idea how degrading child abuse is. They just have no idea. People always think they have some idea, no it's about a 1000 times worse than you think it is. Just start there by admitting that you truly don't know and can't wrap your mind around it. 


The only people who truly understand how much work I'm putting in and who recognize my courage in getting  through this on any level are other survivors of child abuse. They are the only people who don't disparage my hard work and actually have respect for other survivors and the strength it took to get us through.

Everyone seems to be requiring so much of me. People are making empty promises to me and trying to manipulate me and it is so hurtful. I feel more and more ashamed. I guess that these people are not fair. And then they try to help and they get frustrated that their help wasn't enough and blame me. I also opened up to someone about my trauma, initially she was supportive but then she decided that it was too much for her and disappeared. I am really hurt. I feel like I can't win or do OK at this no matter what I do. I've been attacked repeatedly for talking about my trauma by so many people. People just get so angry when I talk about it, my family hates it since it was family violence. Other people look disgusted and get upset. 

I am trying my absolute best and have been trying for a long time. No one sees how hard I am trying, they just label me as lazy. I feel so hurt and shamed by it. I am so so tired of people blaming me no matter what. I tried desperately every way possible to deal with my trauma when it blew up, counsellors just added to the burden and everyone judged me for it. Now everyone is further judgemental and shaming. I am tired of being given the short end of the stick and people always assuming that I can do things that I can't. It's deeply hurtful. I am very very frustrated with people. They don't put other people through what I am put through. It really hurts that I am then judged as lazy. ",lovinglily
PTSD,I'm having a lot of trouble with insomnia. At night when I try to go to bed I feel very angry. My jaw clenches and I can't relax. I don't know what I am so angry about. It's difficult because I don't even know where this emotion is coming from. My adrenaline literally seems to be turned all the way up. I don't really have a visual or in other way sensorial flashback as far as I can tell. Around 2 or 3 am I finally fall asleep after laying there in bed livid for a couple of hours. I sleep three hours (never more than five) and then wake up the next day. ,lovinglily
PTSD,"I was friends with someone who was very supportive and caring, she would listen to me and help me out with things on numerous occasions. However the one thing that she could not let me do was be sad. She always had to cheer me up and to tell me to look on the bright side. I cared about her (and her opinion of me) a great deal, to the point where I felt uncomfortable being sad in front of her and sometimes she would notice when I was sad and force me out of it. I had this fear that if I was truly sad I would lose her friendship. In the end I did because she absolutely did not understand me asking her to not ""cheer me up"" all the time. I really felt embarrassed with her.

Another thing I grapple with is the need to put on a positive face for people and say that I think things are going OK and are going to work out. I have NO idea whether things are going to work out and yes I seem to need to keep reassuring people that they will work out. And actually having to be ""positive"" with people all the time that I'm hopeful makes me feel even more anxious that things are not going to work out. It makes me feel ashamed and terrified to feel my feelings. It adds a lot of anxiety over feeling the way that I do. I hesitate to feel through things. 

I know that this is a social convention to a large extent and it's something that people say to gloss over other people's feelings. I sense that they aren't good with sadness or tragedy and I fear being rejected by them. It made me feel anxious and ashamed of my trauma because I felt that their acceptance was conditional. I was afraid that if I felt the way I felt and if they knew, they would not be able to handle it and want me as a friend because they are so uncomfortable with sadness. I definitely don't feel like this with everyone, but there are few people who understand the things that I have been through and are comfortable with it, who I don't feel ashamed with. Has anyone else had a similar experience with friends ? What are your thoughts on this ?

PTSD,"How do you explain your parents to people ? I find it is hard, since I have been a child my father has been humiliating me publicly. In church he would scream at me publicly in front of everyone else or start beating me to show how bad a person I was. As I got to be a teenager and this became not quite kosher the same way (though he still did it at home behind closed doors, coming up and physically fighting with me and hitting me) he then would tell everyone that he was having ""problems"" with me and manipulate people into coming over to pray for me and talk to me (i.e. bully me). I went to university far away from him and he was sending people to email me, phone me and visit me. As a child he used to tell me this story about this ""bad"" man who never listened to his mother and when he grew up he was ""bad"" so he went to jail and when he went to jail his mother came to visit him and he said, ""Mom I want to tell you a secret"" his mother leaned in to hear him and he bit off her ear. He would say that to tell me he was ""afraid that I was heading down that road."" I felt awful and hopeless after hearing that.  The most difficult thing about what he did was sometimes not the actual acts of doing it, it was the constant and ever present humiliation which I had no control over. No matter how much I tried to please him I would still be humiliated either way. 

My father does this with other people too, he puts them on the spot and uses shame as a method to control them but being his daughter I get the worst of it. 

People do not understand why I just can't brush it off and get on with my life. I've been reading about shame (humiliation is shaming) and the toll that shame takes on people. Most recently I was reading Brene Brown on this in Daring Greatly. Has anyone else read this ? I also read a study about how this psychologist once found a way to predict divorce within 10 years with 90% accuracy in couples. If he found one partner scorning and shaming the other when they talked about a difficult topic, the relationship predictably could not survive the constant humiliation. People just don't have the capacity to stay in a situation where their dignity and sense of self is being assaulted like this and maintain their mental health. They have to get out in order to preserve their health. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I feel like I'm isolating myself from people because at the moment I can't set boundaries as well as I want to be able to. I don't feel good about myself and so I feel like it's very hard for me to set boundaries with people. I feel like I set boundaries almost in retrospect, like I will come back a day or a week later and say, ""That was not OK. I was not OK with that, please don't do that again"" and I notice that other people (and when I'm feeling good I too) can set boundaries almost more intuitively and almost effortlessly and not for big things, and a day or two after it happens but almost like I feel free to express hesitancy or reluctance when something small doesn't make me feel right. Setting boundaries at a later date (over bigger things) almost ensures that there are more hurt feelings and it causes more of a disruption.

It's hard to explain, it's like when I am feeling good I almost do it subconsciously, in a way that when I am feeling ashamed even if I were putting all my effort into it, I wouldn't be able to do it automatically and I wouldn't notice and sense things quickly enough to do it. It takes so much energy and sorrow to be setting boundaries in this state of mind and setting them at the point where I'm able to do so almost after the fact is inclined to cause more friction and take more energy as well.

PTSD,"From now on I'm repledging to just do my best for myself. I'm not killing myself about bending over backwards to make situations turn out OK or to make people like me if they have a misconception about me. I'm just going to do my best and if that isn't good enough, maybe things fall apart or never get put back together but I'm going to be OK with myself. I'm not going to get down on myself for not being better or superhuman.

I think that a lot of the time when people go through trauma we are made to feel like we have to be superhuman in response to it, because a normal human response of being broken or traumatized isn't good enough for many people and you might lose jobs and other aspects of your life if you just have a normal response. There is a due date for recovery and an expectation that you will get over it and survivors/victims wonder if they will indeed have the strength and ability to get over it by that date or if they will have the ability to control their sadness/anger/shame resulting from the trauma enough to be polite and likeable. Has anyone else noticed this or had the same experience ?

In my experience sometimes your best is enough and sometimes it isn't enough and you do lose out when your best isn't good enough and superhuman strength was required. (At least this has been my experience and this is how I now view the world, that sometimes your best isn't good enough and things will still fall apart, but you still have to try anyway). In those sorts of situations when your best isn't good enough to keep the job or friends etc or you are afraid that it might not be, it's so easy in those situations to put pressure on yourself to do better than your best and be superhuman. For me it's really hard when I am terrified that my best won't be enough to hold the situation together (and all hell may break lose because my best isn't good enough) to still love myself and be OK with my best regardless but I am deciding to be OK with my best.

PTSD,"I feel like months keep passing and life is just floating past me and I feel nothing. This has happened before and I tried so hard not to let it happen again but in spite of my best efforts it did and everyone let it happen so now I just feel very ashamed that it is happening again and that I'm in the same place with this happening to me again. I feel an incredible amount of shame that this has happened to me before and now it is happening to me again, like this means there is something deeply wrong with ME that this is happening more than once and it's my fault for not stopping it from happening again. I feel like it must be something about me that I deserve for this to happen to me that this keeps happening to me. I feel like I have a sense of denial about it that ""This is not happening."" I don't particularly sad about what is happening to me because in a way I feel like I deserve it or I am sort of dissociated from it or something. I feel like I deserve to be going through all of this pain, it's not bad that it's happening because it's happening to a really awful person who deserves it. I don't feel sad about what's happening to be me because I don't feel like I deserve any better. It's happened before and is happening again because I'm an awful person. And no one cared to help before and no one cares to help now either and no matter how hard I work to get out this will always keep happening to me (partly thanks to my parents) because this is all I deserve and all that I'm good for pain. I'm the one that the ""bad things happen to"" and are allowed to happen to. I'm the one whose suffering everyone writes off as if I'm deserving of the worst things while other people are actually helped to not end up in my situation. I feel a very deep sense of hopelessness because this has happened before and every time it keeps happening I feel like a worse person who really doesn't deserve to have anything. I don't even feel like killing myself because I feel like however much pain I'm in it I don't care to kill myself because the pain I am in doesn't count anyway, I'm not worth not suffering.

PTSD,"I've been noticing in myself a tendency to avoid people when I feel they are getting too close to me. As soon as someone seems nice it feels like I have a flashback of my mother that they are unexpectedly going to turn on me and claw me to pieces. 
I am terrified of getting into relationships after the relationship I had with my parents growing up. My experience of a relationship is that the person's claws come out unexpectedly without the slightest notice over and over and that is how the relationship goes. 

At the same time I feel like I am traumatically bonded to my parents and I can't seem to lead an independent life and I can't process everything that happened with them. When they seem the slightest bit nice (they can be very charming) I feel like my heart yearns for that love that I missed out on and I just want to believe at all costs that this is love and they do care. I can't seem to put the two pictures of them together the charm and the pain, and yet the pain comes out in flashbacks with strangers and other people.

This is the oddest thing to me because this is exactly the opposite of my reaction with other people where when they seem the littlest bit nice I panic and expect the claws to come out next (which I have little evidence for). But with my parents even though I have ample evidence that this phenomenon of the claws coming out will in fact happen, I don't feel the flashbacks this way. I almost like fawn. I don't know if this is a flashback response itself. It's completely senseless.  ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I have been abused by many people but the thing that makes me feel most awful is how my parents treated me and continue to treat me. I watch other people's parents treat them with respect and care and I can't get past the fact or bend the reality that my parents just didn't, don't care and never will care. No matter what I do, what I manage to accomplish or how hard I work in life I will never be able to get this. My parents will never see me as worthy of respect and love and care. I feel very ashamed and I feel like it is something that I can never quite get over. My parents were involved in religious leadership and almost my entire social world of people growing up looked up to my parents and would not acknowledge the abuse which further shamed me. I felt like I was a lesser form of being (like a dog) that you could treat badly (for a human) but that was OK it did not count as abuse. My parents just do not care. I feel like a second class citizen in the world like I will never have that sense of being quite good enough which is the thing that it seems sometimes I wish for the most. It's almost the way some people describe being black, no matter how hard you work or how high you climb or what you accomplish you will always just be a black person and that's all you will ever be to a lot of people. I feel the same that that's all I will be a second class citizen and regarded as that by some people and there's nothing I can do about it. The only thing that helps is knowing that there were a lot of other people who went through the same thing and also had/have parents who violated their trust and did not care.

Maybe this is depressing to talk about feeling this way and wanting that feeling of being loved and feeling assured that you are indeed worth just as much as anyone else and good like all the rest of the humans but for me whether I talk about it or not the pain is always there, it's always in the background anyway. It is not like I can turn off my pain. I think that it's easier to address it than run from it. ",lovinglily

PTSD,"This is beyond heartbreaking knowing that PTSD sufferers/trauma survivors are killing themselves. I am really upset about LivingInFearPTSD girl posting that she is killing herself. I hope she isn't dead but it looks like she is dead. I don't think I can go through another person on here killing themselves. Please don't anyone else on here kill themselves! I have been feeling just numb for the past couple of days (I couldn't/can't even feel sad) because she was pretty clear from some of her posts that that was her intention. I was having suicidal thoughts tonight in response so this. 

I was trying to tell her not to kill herself that a lot of us feel the same shame but it didn't work. We all fighting a very hard battle and struggling to survive ourselves and it is hard knowing that someone like us has died from it. Her posts over the last couple of days have really taken a toll on my mental health. It is a shame that society did not take her trauma more seriously and help her or prevent it from hapening. We all need to work to change the things in society like abusers/sexual abusers who are causing this PTSD that is killing people. 

I've personally taken steps to try to inform a mother and protect girls that were in the situation this poster was in from abuse. It's chilling to know that those kids could have ended up dead like this from their stepfather's abuse if I hadn't done that (and actually I don't necessarily know that I was able to protect them, they may have been abused and could still end up dead). I've been wishing I could take some MDMA after this incident (but at the same time I kind of don't want to get high because all my own trauma is going to come up on it and I can't deal with that right now) also I don't have any MDMA and I don't want to take it.

PTSD,"Lately I have been thinking about dignity and respect as survivors of trauma. This might seem like an odd post for this subreddit but I feel like it might not only be applicable to us here and but also extra applicable to us since many of our traumas (if they were interpersonal traumas such as rape, child abuse, or being trapped in a traumatic situation to further someone else's ends) were basically caused by people such as the person who attacked us not respecting us. 

I feel that this is also an important question and consideration since sometimes when you have an illness and especially one that affects you emotionally other people easily ""lose"" respect for you, particularly if they don't understand what you are going through. I think that this is one painful aspect of PTSD, watching other people who respected us before lose respect for us as a result of the PTSD symptoms. All our strength and hard work in living each day and putting out best foot forward in a challenging situation can easily go unseen except by the people who respect us. We can be compared to people who are not struggling with PTSD and all the hard work we are doing just to deal with our pain is invisible and can become discounted especially by people who want to believe that the world is a fair place and that it is a meritocracy (to some extent because they want to take credit for their success and where their hard work got them). It's easy to lose our sense of dignity when struggling with PTSD. 

I would like to hear your thoughts on this. What does respect mean to you ? Who has had respect for you and how have they shown it ? How can you tell when a person respects you ? What does a person who respects you say or do ? Can you give some examples ? What are your thoughts on respect ? Thank you in advance for any replies.

Put another way is it so necessary for therapists and others to look down on us in order to treat us ?

PTSD,"I haven't been able to concentrate since I was about six years old. Whereever I am and whatever I am doing I tend to blank out. I don't lose time, I know what I am thinking. It's just that I am off in my mind worrying or being upset. I think that it is like dissociation but it isn't quite dissociation. A couple years ago I was listening to a fun talk and I was off in my mind and then the woman giving the talk noticed that I wasn't there and stared at me very pointedly and determinedly as if to say, ""Come back here."" In a way that was validating because no one notices that I am constantly ""spacing out."" When I was younger people used to think I was just stupid (and generally at work or with practical matters which depend on paying attention, which I can't compensate for people still think I'm stupid). I am lucky because school is the one thing I am good at so I was able to do it even dissociated half of the time.

PTSD,"I went to this intake interview for a trauma program yesterday. I was really looking forward to this. Somehow I was thinking that this was going to be a great program but I didn't feel completely comfortable in the interview. A few of the things that the interviewer said and did set me on edge. For one thing I arrived late for my interview and I said, ""I'm so sorry about that."" After my telling her that I was a bit out of it because of the family difficulty the night before, the interviewer then turned it around to say, ""Well you were taking care of yourself good for you for coming late."" That really seemed ridiculous to me and made me feel really uncomfortable. Why are you congratulating me for being irresponsible and incompetent and coming late ? I didn't choose to come late it only happened because I was so depressed and sad and it's something that needs to be changed not celebrated. Edited to add (I've been feeling suicidal since talking to her yesterday.)


Then concerning some sexual harassment I had faced, she asked me how I had ""retaliated.""
The whole thing felt a bit uncomfortable because I felt like my feelings were wrong about what I had been through, like she was getting me to be more sad than I actually am and I was feeling like my feelings were wrong and that she knew my feelings better than I did. It felt like she had too much control in the interaction and I had too little. Logically the program looks good and I agree with it philosophically and everything but in terms of how it feels to me it in some ways it felt wrong. Usually I go with how I feel logically rather than my gut sense but that has not worked out well on a few occasions. I'm disappointed since I was looking forward to this and thinking that this would be good.

PTSD,"Trying to access mental healthcare to take care of my mental health feels like a continual struggle. I had an exploitative counsellor a few years ago and from there things have spiralled out of control. During this time my PTSD started happening from this combined with a traumatic incident. Other counsellors I have seen have refused to acknowledge that he did anything wrong which of course left me unable to trust them. 

It's getting to the point for me where I have almost given up seeking help. I am so demoralized. I feel awful. I notice that I have a very proactive approach towards my physical healthcare. I feel that physically taking care of myself is my responsibility and even if the doctor gives me the wrong advice about taking care of my body, I need to look out for myself and take responsibility because it will be me living with whatever consequences not the doctor. 

But in regard to my mental healthcare, it feels like I have learned helplessness. It is so hard to access help that it feels frustrating and out of my reach. It feels like my mental health is something that is not entirely in my control to take care of. It seems like I get and loose good mental healthcare arbitrarily and that it's something other people have control over rather than me. It's demoralizing to not have the tools and help I need to stay mentally healthy within reach. I feel like I can't take care of myself and good mental health is outside of my reach. I don't feel competent about taking care of myself mentally or proactive about my mental health but at the same time I can see that if I faced the obstacles in regard to my physical health that I do in regard to my mental health I would likely be extremely demoralized and may have given up on that too at this point rather than having the attitude that things are within my hands.

I feel like mental health is something that just happens to me, that other people do to me which is outside of my control and if other people are just nice enough love can fix my problems. I feel that I have come to be quite unproactive about my mental health. Does anyone else feel the same ?

This is so different however from how I relate to my physical health which I am very proactive about. I feel that my body is mine and I am in a way alone with it if it is diseased, no one can save me from myself so I need to take care of myself. I'm the one that is going to suffer if I don't take care of my physical body not other people, not the doctors. I feel that it is my responsibility to take care of my physical body. 

But with my mental health I find it hard to see it this way. Maybe I have just been attacked too many times so I've given up hope that I can keep myself safe and healthy mentally. I feel like mental health is something that just happens to me and isn't within my reach to take care of.

I realize that rationally dealing with my PTSD symptoms is like dealing with someone who can't stop throwing up. They throw up where ever you go with them, and all over the building at work and on your nice rug and they throw up on the floor and you have to clean it up and you have to make sure you're not in your nice clothes around them. 

I hate that I'm the one throwing up on the floor and getting it dirty for other people AND of course I feel absolutely 100x more awful from throwing up all the time in the first place and wish I could be well so much :( Knowing that you are getting someone's floor dirty doesn't help with the shame of PTSD either. I am really fed up of having this, I want this to end. Sometimes I feel suicidal.

I was getting counselling for things but then I tried to be open with someone else about what I was confronting and he just didn't believe me or want to help. I felt like he saw me as a liar.

PTSD,"[http://www.cphpost.dk/community/trailblazing-continent-foot-raising-awareness-child-sex-abuse]

This article is titled: ""Trailblazing the continent on foot, raising awareness of child sex abuse""
Some excerpts: CBeebies actor Matthew McVarish, himself the victim of an abusive uncle, is taking a 16,000km trek to raise awareness of the problem
A star of the BBC children’s programme ‘Me Too!’, McVarish also works as the European ambassador for the non-profit organisation Stop the Silence: Stop Child Sexual Abuse. He said he views his trip around Europe as one of the responsibilities of the position.
McVarish pointed out, however, that his intentions weren’t to drag out the past for him or for anyone he meets on the road. Instead, he hopes to help prevent cases of abuse in the future by encouraging victims to speak up.
“I’ve spoken to thousands of survivors on my walk, and I ask them if they’ve ever talked to the police. Many say that they don’t feel strong enough to stand in the same courtroom as the person who abused them,” he said.
“I completely understand that, because it’s very difficult,” he went on. “But I ask them: ‘Do you think you’re stronger as an adult than the child that same person might abuse tonight, or tomorrow, or next week?’ It’s not about seeking revenge or compensation, it’s about child protection right now.”

PTSD,"I saw an article about Elizabeth Loftus today and False Memory Syndrome. This woman really upsets me. She did one study that false memories of being lost in a shopping mall can be implanted and now her whole career is based on saying that child sexual abuse victims are confused (i.e. lying). 

I just don't understand how she can do this to the most vulnerable of the vulnerable, victims of child abuse by someone in their families. It is so upsetting to hear about her testifying in these cases to keep child sexual abusers from facing prosecution and justice. It is sad. 

I also don't understand how someone that calls them a researcher/scientist can get themselves involved in such a political and legal issue and be working as an expert consultant getting paid to testify in court. I mean researchers are supposed to be impartial but to base your whole career around one point of view, means that you start wanting only results that confirm that. I feel like she is targeting child sexual abuse victims in particular. 

I also don't understand why she seems to be mainly applying her ""false memory"" ideas to just incest victims. You would think that false memory could apply to many situations across the board not just to one issue.

Some excerpts:
CBeebies actor Matthew McVarish, himself the victim of an abusive uncle, is taking a 16,000km trek to raise awareness of the problem



A star of the BBC children’s programme ‘Me Too!’, McVarish also works as the European ambassador for the non-profit organisation Stop the Silence: Stop Child Sexual Abuse. He said he views his trip around Europe as one of the responsibilities of the position.

McVarish pointed out, however, that his intentions weren’t to drag out the past for him or for anyone he meets on the road. Instead, he hopes to help prevent cases of abuse in the future by encouraging victims to speak up.

“I’ve spoken to thousands of survivors on my walk, and I ask them if they’ve ever talked to the police. Many say that they don’t feel strong enough to stand in the same courtroom as the person who abused them,” he said.

“I completely understand that, because it’s very difficult,” he went on. “But I ask them: ‘Do you think you’re stronger as an adult than the child that same person might abuse tonight, or tomorrow, or next week?’ It’s not about seeking revenge or compensation, it’s about child protection right now.”

PTSD,"I have gone through some very difficult things with my fundamentalist religious parents. For a long time I have felt like the things that they do violate my sense of morality/conscience. See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1muroe/dealing_with_traumatic_events_how_to_deal_kind_of/) for an example. I feel like I cannot take the pain of how they treat me and also how they treat other people anymore. I am considering ending things with them but it is difficult for me. I care about them to some extent as well, and I am also terrified of society's opprobrium/anger disapproval towards anyone who would make a break with family. I am an INTP. I wanted to ask some NFs their thoughts on this because I am inclined to want to do non traditional things and ""innovate"" being an N. I don't understand why I should have to follow social convention and stay close to my family no matter what, logically it makes no sense and seems ridiculous, but then being an INTP I'm not terribly aware of and good at managing feelings. I'm not good at budgeting for my and others emotional needs. I've had my bf tell me it's not a good idea to leave and it's really hard not to listen to him. A few counsellors I talked to were not in favour of me leaving even though the relationship is bad and hurting me because they thought that I was, ""too upset about it, it seems kind of like you want to leave but you don't."" One counsellor thought it was a good idea. It was hard for me to know whether these counsellors were uncomfortable with the idea because of tradition and ""family above all else"" which it seems most people in our society adhere to or something else. 

So I wanted to ask some NFs your thoughts, because I figure you all are likely to have a better grip on feelings than me and also to not be locked into tradition at all costs. Have any of you ever done this or watched any of your friends do this ? How did you feel about it ?

Edit: I want to ask this, I feel that I can do a sort of logical costs benefits analysis about leaving my family versus staying but emotionally it's hard for me to have a sense of it, it's hard for me to size it up in an emotionally engaged way. It's hard for me to feel the situation as a whole. I can feel parts of it, like the benefits and then the costs of it but I can't feel it all together. How does this feel to you all who have decided to leave emotionally ?",lovinglily
PTSD,"I can handle J types neatness and organization etc. I notice I find it hard to deal with their certainty about things. I often find it comes across as either arrogant and overly certain. I often feel like J types get my back up against a wall and I feel cornered and stubborn. Also their ways of communicating/advocating their points don't appeal to me. The more certain they get about the point that they are making and that they are right, the more resistant I feel to what they are saying. Does anyone else feel the same ? It's a lot easier for someone to get me to listen if they appeal to uncertainty, and say, ""Well I can't be certain that you are right."" I find that of course quite intriguing/interesting.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Firstly let me say, this is difficult to deal with the following as an INTP because I'm not good at sensing and talking about my feelings. The INTP drive for knowledge and, ""If I find out enough I'll be competent and I just need to learn everything to deal with this. The more upset I get the more knowledge I try to gather"" means that I just read more and more upsetting statistics and upsetting stories, and not being super in tune with feelings I just process things rationally and I don't even have a great grasp on how much my continuing delving into this is upsetting me. Not to mention the INTP ""The truth is what matters I have to find out the truth"" and paying attention to logic and making decisions by logic rather than taking feelings (my feelings) into consideration. 

I'm 29, I was sexually abused by a guy in my church when I was 7 and a couple years ago the same man married a woman with children from a previous marriage. My parents fucking knew what happened with me (I told them when I was 7 because the whole ""Keeping a secret thing seemed illogical/pretentious/grated on my truthful ""I hate pretending"" logical self"") and said nothing/did nothing to intervene. A bunch of people knew and did nothing. 

It was basically hell for me to try to get anyone to listen and get those kids away from him. People's attitudes (including numerous counsellors (more like 7 of them) I have been to, YES I have talked to a counsellor about this, but they are mostly F types which I will get to in a minute) and apathy towards this issue is just unbelievable. Everyone is all ""Oh I'm against child abuse"" but when it happens no one wants to lift a finger to help. 

As an INTP I have a low tolerance for fakeness and the fakeness upsets me. I really don't ""get"" it about the Fs just being ""nice"" and saying things that they don't believe in to make everyone ""feel nice."" And I don't get it about the S types just not wanting to rock the boat and just go along with things as they've always been done, you know we want to be conventional, and I've never seen someone talk about sexual abuse before or take steps to deal with it and I don't want to be the first. I don't understand why people can't just do the right thing. 



It really irritates me that this is all about being socially/politically correct to most people and there's no ""truth"" in it and conviction about the truth in it, and everyone is so fake competent at dealing with it. Everyone knows exactly which boxes to tick off and all the right fake words to say to convince everyone they are politically correct. It's all just a fucking social game to people. 


I wish every person that says they ""CARE"" about this but doesn't would just get rid of themselves honestly. ~7 counsellors heard about this from me, they are legally obligated to report it but none of them did. They all told ""me"" to report it. I eventually did report it to a hotline even though I am the person who suffered through this myself and for whom it is hardest to talk about this and expose myself. The kids are now away from this man, apparently the mother finally listened (and my parents finally spoke up) and left him. It's not just the perpetrators who cause this to continue to happen it's the people who say, ""oh I'm a good person. I would stand up against that"" and then do nothing and want to protect perpetrators. I wish not only the perpetrators but those fake people who say they care but they don't were in hell where they were having to relive the abuse they put other people through every single day until they figure it the fuck out that it's wrong and stop with the fakeness.

Dealing with a situation like this is clearly not my strong suit (?) or area of competence at all. 

Edit:  ~7 counsellors heard about this from me, they are legally obligated to report it but NONE of them did. Why did you sign up to be a counsellor and agree to report things like this and what the fuck did they teach you in psychology/counselling school if it makes you too uncomfortable to deal with stuff like this ? They are there to make money, play peekabo with people and do nothing productive whatsoever.

I wasn't completely clear, the kids are away from this man. But it just feels like a very tiny victory knowing that I was basically the *only* person in the situation who gave a fuck about stopping it. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I was sexually abused by a guy in my church when I was 7 years old. I was ""OK"" (holding it together mentally but barely) until about 4 years ago when my best friend attacked me about the childhood sexual abuse and basically said it was my fault. I lost my mind and began having PTSD symptoms and just stopped giving a f%*&. I was incidentally seeing a therapist at the time and I brought up the childhood sexual abuse with him but he didn't want to talk about it/help me with it.



As if that wasn't enough the abuser contacted me shortly afterwards trying to add me on Facebook. Then I learned that he had married a woman from my (former) church who had little children from her marriage before. My fundamentalist Christian parents who knew what he did to me, did nothing to try and help/remove this kids and that really broke my heart (they knew even before me that this predator was marrying this woman with children and they didn't care to do anything).
I told everyone in the church and my entire extended family about the abuse and that this man was kids to try to protect them almost even though I didn't want to expose myself. It was like PTSD flashbacks to feel that this was happening to another kid again.



Personally I don't know how far I would have gone in reporting this man and exposing everything to the light. I have horrible feelings about speaking up, I felt (/feel) quite ashamed and went far beyond what I was comfortable with trying to report this stuff. I did it partly because after the PTSD blew up I just stopped giving a f%&*, I want social support but I just don't have the motivation. I feel disconnected from people since this whole thing, after seeing the level of apathy and just lack of care in people (including my parents not having ever reported the man to the police for what he did to me or taking action to help these kids) and after my best friend's attacking me and saying it was my fault. I just don't care, I don't care to do all the social niceties and be polite and generally fit in in society. I don't feel like being careful to only show people my cute face and follow the rules and hide my ugly spots, I find I just honestly don't care. I wish I could care but I just don't. I don't want to sit down and be cute and get people's approval anymore, it just doesn't mean that much to me as hard as I try for it to mean something it just doesn't.



Many people have said they care but it's always followed up with more nonsense like not taking action to protect those children. (Their mother did remove them from the man after I told so many people in my parents church that it shamed the mother, grandmother and my parents into action). Everyone (especially in the counselling/psychology profession) keeps making these wacky statements about how my friend didn't mean what she said and tries to excuse my parents and everyone. It feels like a trauma just to be alive, I don't want to live on this planet with people.



I don't give a f&%*. I can't remember feeling this apathetic at any point in my life before. I feel that I can't trust in people anymore. I just don't care to make any sort of working relationship with anyone work. I'm not pushing anyone away (people are jerks enough as it is) but I'm not editing myself or making myself approvable either. I feel like with friends like my best friend and parents and church, why even bother ? With friends like that who needs enemies ? I'm not doing anything horrible to people but I don't feel like I'll ever have a real honest connection with anyone anymore.



Whether people can understand the situation you are in and be on your side just seems so arbitrary. It's like if they can mentally understand, if it's culturally accepted then they will be ""there"" with you but it's always so arbitrary and any reason something could blow up and you could find you have no one with you. For the past five years I've been fighting the urge to kill myself (after my best friend blamed me for what happened), that's what I really wanted to do, instead I just sabotaged my life in small ways.

I notice that on many occasions I've become sort of immobilized/paralyzed and passive from it. What do you all try to do when this happens ? 

I was reading in the book on PTSD that people have been able to survive traumatic experiences and get through them better with less risk of PTSD if they did something about the trauma that was happening (usually to try and stop it/fix it), their efforts didn't even have to work, they just had to be active and be doing something (and I guess not feeling completely helpless) for it to lessen their risk of PTSD.

PTSD,"Has anyone else gotten people inaccurately concluding that you have aspergers when you are under extreme stress? My personality is naturally stoic (I don't show pain easily, there's a lot of emotion under there (definitely a lot of empathy for others) but it doesn't naturally show unless I make a point of revealing it), logical and calm. I also don't always have that much interest naturally in social games, sugarcoating (and on occasion I dislike small talk) though I do put in the effort at these. I find that with the stress of PTSD a lot of my sugarcoating fell/falls by the wayside. I wasn't able to keep up as well with these things as well. I also started to feel a lot of shame and I largely stopped making eye contact with people. I knew it was unlike me and actually felt really embarrassed about that. (I would compare it to being depressed and unable to wash your hair and having people assume that you just don't know to wash your hair or don't know you should wash your hair when in fact you do know to wash your hair and in fact you feel very embarrassed about your unwashed hair and the fact that you just don't have the energy to wash it). 

Because I was grappling with this feeling of betrayal and hopelessness about ever connecting with people and not having them then betray me I also felt like I was at my wits' end with people. I don't know if I should say that I did not want to connect with people but I was definitely avoiding a lot of connection for fear of being betrayed again. I was not glossing over things like I normally did and was not adding all the social niceties and normal politeness because partly I was hurting so much that I didn't have the motivation to do that. 

This led some people  to assume that I had aspergers disorder, instead of seeing that I was really out of it with the PTSD. I was under so much stress and that's why I was acting that way meanwhile people were assuming that the effects of the stress were a natural characteristic of me instead of seeing them for what they were. I mean certain things I can do with my eyes closed, no matter how ill or stressed out I am because I am good at them (like logic and deep thinking), other things where I am not naturally talented at them, those things fall apart more easily when I'm under a lot of stress, in the same way that other people might find the first place their stress shows is with them failing courses for me it's harder to fake with people, negotiate interpersonal situations and get people to do what I want and that's one of the things to go. It doesn't help of course that I'm a woman and being more stoic/calm and logical as a woman is not expected (it is gender non conforming), so people I suppose find my gender non conformity in that sense a bit difficult to interpret and jump to the aspergers' conclusion. Has anyone felt the same ?

PS I think one way to tell the difference between people with aspergers and those with post traumatic stress is that people with aspergers seem a lot more agreeable. They generally seem to want to learn the right rules to follow and put great effort into following the rules whereas those with PTSD may not want to follow the rules because that means risking emotional connection and subsequent betrayal again.

PTSD,"Sometimes I feel like pressure to ""recover"" is making my post traumatic stress worse. I feel like people want me to go back to ""normal"" so that they can skip the step of acknowledging the depth of what I went through and skip the step of acknowledging my bravery in surviving. I don't begrudge people not wanting to deal with my post traumatic stress symptoms (for their own benefit and not my own) but I feel like they want my symptoms to go away so that they can deny what I've been through or just can't be bothered. They don't want to acknowledge the depth of what I've been through because it threatens them (they don't get to feel smug and better than me anymore). I feel like this pushes me to try to suppress and get rid of my feelings. Then I feel like I'm trying to avoid my feelings because I know that other people want to avoid them too and I feel like it's making it worse.

I know that true recovery would look like my bravery in surviving being acknowledged and celebrated even when I no longer have any symptoms. I know that even if I were to recover some people would not want to acknowledge my bravery in surviving, but they would be glad that I was ""functional"" because it's less of a problem for them. Then there would be some people who would acknowledge my bravery in surviving even though they ""didn't have to"". It's not getting rid of any symptoms for them or doing anything to improve their life, in fact it's costing them something to say that to me.

Then while I was being abused and was unable to extract myself from the abuse many people judged me as lazy or not trying hard enough. I had people slam doors in my face (literally). That hurt. During that time I was waking up in the morning feeling like putting a gun to my head and I would calm myself down by telling myself, ""This is just post traumatic stress... many people feel this way. It doesn't mean I should actually act on it, it's OK to have the feeling and not act on it."" Meanwhile people were treating me like I was lazy and slamming doors in my face. Then finally they figure out that they misjudged you and they want it go back to normal now and they will treat you like you are normal or something, but it still hurts. I don't know how to classify their sorry. I guess they figured out they evaluated wrong and that's good that they were at least able to get to that point. I paid all the cost of their misjudgement and they are content for me to have paid all the cost and to keep paying it. They are ""sorry"" but really it's no skin off of their back, I've been the one to incur all the losses, what did they incur and what does their sorry mean ? What sacrifices are they making and does it come anything close to the price that I've paid? And I still feel like if I were in the same position again for some reason they would still be misjudging me. It feels hollow. It still hurts.

I've had severe PTSD for many years, it's gotten better to some extent for a few years. 99% of people have no empathy for what I'm going through and I get misjudged, blamed and rejected a lot. When I was doing better, more people were accepting. Some of them then wanted to be ""friends"" and pretend like everything was good, people who had never been there for me before. The question for me then was should I forgive people who were hurtful to me and unaccepting before.  Now unfortunately in spite of my very best efforts my PTSD has been reinvigorated again. A lot of people are now rejecting and judgemental again. It hurts. This is not something that I had or have control over. I tried so hard to not have this flare up again and now it has. I think I see some people's motivations more in this situation and I don't like what I am seeing. I am particularly heartbroken at being misjudged, people act like I'm trying to be like this or I just need some tough love or someone to set down the boundaries. Can't they see that I was attacked again and again and again ? Also people do not care about the years of my life that I've lost while I was struggling to hold it together and doing everything in my power to try to recover. To them it's just like, ""You're one of those people doesn't have family support and who takes longer to get things."" On the other hand someone else said to me a while ago, ""It's our loss that we've lost your contributions over these years that you've been unable to contribute"" and that was healing to me, I believed them and that was what I needed to hear to know that they really cared. 

The thing is that even if I did hypothetically get better again, and people start being ""nice"" again out of wanting my usefulness to them will I then blindly ""trust"" all these selfish people ? Will I then ""forgive"" them and forget about their motivations ? That would feel like a betrayal to myself, how will I deal with that ?

PTSD,"Please bear with my rant here. I feel like the only people who truly have empathy with me are other survivors of child abuse. Everyone else keeps saying, ""But your parents really care"" or some such BS. And even people who don't say that you can tell that deep down they don't respect you, especially for having the problems that come with PTSD/CPTSD or the problems that your parents create when they abuse you. They are secretly giving themselves points for having been stronger or having been more ingenious at dealing with obstacles. They secretly think that they are better. They have no idea how degrading child abuse is and the toll it takes on a person's mental health. They have no idea how betrayal feels. And this disrespect is not just something out in the ether somewhere, the contempt for survivors not having ""kept it together"" and stayed as ""sane"" as them is a continual drain because all day long I have to interact with people who look at me this way. I feel it and live with subtle but ever draining contempt from people every day. It's like how black people feel trying to explain racism to white people, and how women feel trying to explain sexism to men or how rich people have no idea what it is like to struggle financially.


Even if people ""say"" nothing, you feel the judgement in the way that they look at you, they always think that they deserve to have what they had, they worked hard for it (they worked harder than you is the assumption/implication).

Meanwhile they don't understand the toll that shame takes and the toll that betrayal takes and they don't want to understand or see a need to understand that you had to grapple with so much more than them. In fact they find it threatening to their sense of accomplishment and pride. They need to have their pride that they were so much stronger than you to get their stuff and they feel diminished in acknowledging that they weren't that much stronger, they simply had things a lot easier. People will do anything to avoid giving this ounce of dignity and human respect to a survivor of abuse. And it hurts being treated this way. It takes a toll. You go through the abuse, and then when you get through it you have to live with a society that has contempt for you as a survivor.


I honestly have no problem trying to keep it together and acting like I have it together even when I feel awful or when I feel like I'm not together, but the continual diminishment of the courage and disparagement hard work that it takes for me to do this takes a toll. You feel people's contempt for your hard work. They look at it and it doesn't matter to them, it doesn't exist or they want to make it not exist. But it is hard to keep putting in that level of hard work, it's hard to keep having that motivation with people's diminishment and disparagement of my hard work. It is crazy making because society is constantly sending you the message that, ""No it is not that hard, it's as easy for you as everyone else."" What do you do with your feelings about how much you are struggling through and how much hard work you are putting in when society resolutely and determinedly denies how hard it is for you? When people give you that message it makes you hate yourself. It makes you hate your feelings, it makes you hate your feelings of how hard it is for you. It is incredibly disparaging to you there who are swimming frantically and struggling so hard just to stay afloat. It drains your motivation to try. It shames you, it makes you think that your feelings of exhaustion are wrong and something to be ashamed of. It adds to your burden of making you feel that something is wrong with you for hurting this way and finding it so hard. The continual contempt from people and minimization of the immense hard work we put in just to survive takes a toll and makes it impossible to keep your spirits and motivation up to keep putting in that level of work. Then of course if my motivation falters because society is telling me my hard work doesn't exist, then I'm to blame for not ""keeping it together."" During all of this people continued to enable my father to harass me and enable his abuse. 


The time in my life when I was the most mentally healthy and was the most together was when I had a friend who had been a similar victim of child abuse to me as a child and had experienced the same level of rejection and betrayal from her parents. I am immensely grateful for having had her. I believe that I would not have graduated high school and my life would be in a much worse situation if I hadn't had her. The thing that she gave me was genuine understanding and empathy and she did not scorn me or subtly minimize the abuse like everyone else did. She actually understood and said that it was wrong. For non survivors as a nice starting place it would be great if people would at least admit that they have no idea how degrading child abuse is. They just have no idea. People always think they have some idea, no it's about a 1000 times worse than you think it is. Just start there by admitting that you truly don't know and can't wrap your mind around it. 


The only people who truly understand how much work I'm putting in and who recognize my courage in getting  through this on any level are other survivors of child abuse. They are the only people who don't disparage my hard work and actually have respect for other survivors and the strength it took to get us through.

PTSD,"This perspective so infuriating and disgusting. I've had numerous people try to deny my trauma and my strength in surviving things. I get my strength diminished from the, ""I want to take credit for all my accomplishments and feel that I'm amazing and better than everyone else. Admitting that I had it easier than you not having to go through trauma will diminish my self satisfaction,"" crowd and then the people who haven't accomplished as much want to say, ""Your trauma doesn't count because it wasn't as bad as mine so it wasn't real abuse.""

PTSD,"I'm having a very long week. I've been feeling so much shame. I was getting so (a mixture of) angry and ashamed last week and that I could not sleep. I am disappointed in a lot of people. Everyone seems to be requiring so much of me. People are making empty promises to me and trying to manipulate me and it is so hurtful. I feel more and more ashamed. I guess that these people are not fair. And then they try to help and they get frustrated that their help wasn't enough and blame me. I also opened up to someone about my trauma, initially she was supportive but then she decided that it was too much for her and disappeared. I am really hurt. I feel like I can't win or do OK at this no matter what I do. I've been attacked repeatedly for talking about my trauma by so many people. People just get so angry when I talk about it, my family hates it since it was family violence. Other people look disgusted and get upset. 

I am trying my absolute best and have been trying for a long time. No one sees how hard I am trying, they just label me as lazy. I feel so hurt and shamed by it. I am so so tired of people blaming me no matter what. I tried desperately every way possible to deal with my trauma when it blew up, counsellors just added to the burden and everyone judged me for it. Now everyone is further judgemental and shaming. I am tired of being given the short end of the stick and people always assuming that I can do things that I can't. It's deeply hurtful. I am very very frustrated with people. They don't put other people through what I am put through. It really hurts that I am then judged as lazy. ",lovinglily
PTSD,I'm having a lot of trouble with insomnia. At night when I try to go to bed I feel very angry. My jaw clenches and I can't relax. I don't know what I am so angry about. It's difficult because I don't even know where this emotion is coming from. My adrenaline literally seems to be turned all the way up. I don't really have a visual or in other way sensorial flashback as far as I can tell. Around 2 or 3 am I finally fall asleep after laying there in bed livid for a couple of hours. I sleep three hours (never more than five) and then wake up the next day. ,lovinglily
PTSD,"I was friends with someone who was very supportive and caring, she would listen to me and help me out with things on numerous occasions. However the one thing that she could not let me do was be sad. She always had to cheer me up and to tell me to look on the bright side. I cared about her (and her opinion of me) a great deal, to the point where I felt uncomfortable being sad in front of her and sometimes she would notice when I was sad and force me out of it. I had this fear that if I was truly sad I would lose her friendship. In the end I did because she absolutely did not understand me asking her to not ""cheer me up"" all the time. I really felt embarrassed with her.

Another thing I grapple with is the need to put on a positive face for people and say that I think things are going OK and are going to work out. I have NO idea whether things are going to work out and yes I seem to need to keep reassuring people that they will work out. And actually having to be ""positive"" with people all the time that I'm hopeful makes me feel even more anxious that things are not going to work out. It makes me feel ashamed and terrified to feel my feelings. It adds a lot of anxiety over feeling the way that I do. I hesitate to feel through things. 

I know that this is a social convention to a large extent and it's something that people say to gloss over other people's feelings. I sense that they aren't good with sadness or tragedy and I fear being rejected by them. It made me feel anxious and ashamed of my trauma because I felt that their acceptance was conditional. I was afraid that if I felt the way I felt and if they knew, they would not be able to handle it and want me as a friend because they are so uncomfortable with sadness. I definitely don't feel like this with everyone, but there are few people who understand the things that I have been through and are comfortable with it, who I don't feel ashamed with. Has anyone else had a similar experience with friends ? What are your thoughts on this ?

PTSD,"How do you explain your parents to people ? I find it is hard, since I have been a child my father has been humiliating me publicly. In church he would scream at me publicly in front of everyone else or start beating me to show how bad a person I was. As I got to be a teenager and this became not quite kosher the same way (though he still did it at home behind closed doors, coming up and physically fighting with me and hitting me) he then would tell everyone that he was having ""problems"" with me and manipulate people into coming over to pray for me and talk to me (i.e. bully me). I went to university far away from him and he was sending people to email me, phone me and visit me. As a child he used to tell me this story about this ""bad"" man who never listened to his mother and when he grew up he was ""bad"" so he went to jail and when he went to jail his mother came to visit him and he said, ""Mom I want to tell you a secret"" his mother leaned in to hear him and he bit off her ear. He would say that to tell me he was ""afraid that I was heading down that road."" I felt awful and hopeless after hearing that.  The most difficult thing about what he did was sometimes not the actual acts of doing it, it was the constant and ever present humiliation which I had no control over. No matter how much I tried to please him I would still be humiliated either way. 

My father does this with other people too, he puts them on the spot and uses shame as a method to control them but being his daughter I get the worst of it. 

People do not understand why I just can't brush it off and get on with my life. I've been reading about shame (humiliation is shaming) and the toll that shame takes on people. Most recently I was reading Brene Brown on this in Daring Greatly. Has anyone else read this ? I also read a study about how this psychologist once found a way to predict divorce within 10 years with 90% accuracy in couples. If he found one partner scorning and shaming the other when they talked about a difficult topic, the relationship predictably could not survive the constant humiliation. People just don't have the capacity to stay in a situation where their dignity and sense of self is being assaulted like this and maintain their mental health. They have to get out in order to preserve their health. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I feel like I'm isolating myself from people because at the moment I can't set boundaries as well as I want to be able to. I don't feel good about myself and so I feel like it's very hard for me to set boundaries with people. I feel like I set boundaries almost in retrospect, like I will come back a day or a week later and say, ""That was not OK. I was not OK with that, please don't do that again"" and I notice that other people (and when I'm feeling good I too) can set boundaries almost more intuitively and almost effortlessly and not for big things, and a day or two after it happens but almost like I feel free to express hesitancy or reluctance when something small doesn't make me feel right. Setting boundaries at a later date (over bigger things) almost ensures that there are more hurt feelings and it causes more of a disruption.

It's hard to explain, it's like when I am feeling good I almost do it subconsciously, in a way that when I am feeling ashamed even if I were putting all my effort into it, I wouldn't be able to do it automatically and I wouldn't notice and sense things quickly enough to do it. It takes so much energy and sorrow to be setting boundaries in this state of mind and setting them at the point where I'm able to do so almost after the fact is inclined to cause more friction and take more energy as well.

PTSD,"From now on I'm repledging to just do my best for myself. I'm not killing myself about bending over backwards to make situations turn out OK or to make people like me if they have a misconception about me. I'm just going to do my best and if that isn't good enough, maybe things fall apart or never get put back together but I'm going to be OK with myself. I'm not going to get down on myself for not being better or superhuman.

I think that a lot of the time when people go through trauma we are made to feel like we have to be superhuman in response to it, because a normal human response of being broken or traumatized isn't good enough for many people and you might lose jobs and other aspects of your life if you just have a normal response. There is a due date for recovery and an expectation that you will get over it and survivors/victims wonder if they will indeed have the strength and ability to get over it by that date or if they will have the ability to control their sadness/anger/shame resulting from the trauma enough to be polite and likeable. Has anyone else noticed this or had the same experience ?

In my experience sometimes your best is enough and sometimes it isn't enough and you do lose out when your best isn't good enough and superhuman strength was required. (At least this has been my experience and this is how I now view the world, that sometimes your best isn't good enough and things will still fall apart, but you still have to try anyway). In those sorts of situations when your best isn't good enough to keep the job or friends etc or you are afraid that it might not be, it's so easy in those situations to put pressure on yourself to do better than your best and be superhuman. For me it's really hard when I am terrified that my best won't be enough to hold the situation together (and all hell may break lose because my best isn't good enough) to still love myself and be OK with my best regardless but I am deciding to be OK with my best.

This has happened before and I tried so hard not to let it happen again but in spite of my best efforts it did and everyone let it happen so now I just feel very ashamed that it is happening again and that I'm in the same place with this happening to me again. I feel an incredible amount of shame that this has happened to me before and now it is happening to me again, like this means there is something deeply wrong with ME that this is happening more than once and it's my fault for not stopping it from happening again. I feel like it must be something about me that I deserve for this to happen to me that this keeps happening to me. I feel like I have a sense of denial about it that ""This is not happening."" I don't particularly sad about what is happening to me because in a way I feel like I deserve it or I am sort of dissociated from it or something. I feel like I deserve to be going through all of this pain, it's not bad that it's happening because it's happening to a really awful person who deserves it. I don't feel sad about what's happening to be me because I don't feel like I deserve any better. It's happened before and is happening again because I'm an awful person. And no one cared to help before and no one cares to help now either and no matter how hard I work to get out this will always keep happening to me (partly thanks to my parents) because this is all I deserve and all that I'm good for pain. I'm the one that the ""bad things happen to"" and are allowed to happen to. I'm the one whose suffering everyone writes off as if I'm deserving of the worst things while other people are actually helped to not end up in my situation. I feel a very deep sense of hopelessness because this has happened before and every time it keeps happening I feel like a worse person who really doesn't deserve to have anything. I don't even feel like killing myself because I feel like however much pain I'm in it I don't care to kill myself because the pain I am in doesn't count anyway, I'm not worth not suffering.

PTSD,"I've been noticing in myself a tendency to avoid people when I feel they are getting too close to me. As soon as someone seems nice it feels like I have a flashback of my mother that they are unexpectedly going to turn on me and claw me to pieces. 
I am terrified of getting into relationships after the relationship I had with my parents growing up. My experience of a relationship is that the person's claws come out unexpectedly without the slightest notice over and over and that is how the relationship goes. 

At the same time I feel like I am traumatically bonded to my parents and I can't seem to lead an independent life and I can't process everything that happened with them. When they seem the slightest bit nice (they can be very charming) I feel like my heart yearns for that love that I missed out on and I just want to believe at all costs that this is love and they do care. I can't seem to put the two pictures of them together the charm and the pain, and yet the pain comes out in flashbacks with strangers and other people.

This is the oddest thing to me because this is exactly the opposite of my reaction with other people where when they seem the littlest bit nice I panic and expect the claws to come out next (which I have little evidence for). But with my parents even though I have ample evidence that this phenomenon of the claws coming out will in fact happen, I don't feel the flashbacks this way. I almost like fawn. I don't know if this is a flashback response itself. It's completely senseless.  ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I have been abused by many people but the thing that makes me feel most awful is how my parents treated me and continue to treat me. I watch other people's parents treat them with respect and care and I can't get past the fact or bend the reality that my parents just didn't, don't care and never will care. No matter what I do, what I manage to accomplish or how hard I work in life I will never be able to get this. My parents will never see me as worthy of respect and love and care. I feel very ashamed and I feel like it is something that I can never quite get over. My parents were involved in religious leadership and almost my entire social world of people growing up looked up to my parents and would not acknowledge the abuse which further shamed me. I felt like I was a lesser form of being (like a dog) that you could treat badly (for a human) but that was OK it did not count as abuse. My parents just do not care. I feel like a second class citizen in the world like I will never have that sense of being quite good enough which is the thing that it seems sometimes I wish for the most. It's almost the way some people describe being black, no matter how hard you work or how high you climb or what you accomplish you will always just be a black person and that's all you will ever be to a lot of people. I feel the same that that's all I will be a second class citizen and regarded as that by some people and there's nothing I can do about it. The only thing that helps is knowing that there were a lot of other people who went through the same thing and also had/have parents who violated their trust and did not care.

Maybe this is depressing to talk about feeling this way and wanting that feeling of being loved and feeling assured that you are indeed worth just as much as anyone else and good like all the rest of the humans but for me whether I talk about it or not the pain is always there, it's always in the background anyway.

PTSD,"This is beyond heartbreaking knowing that PTSD sufferers/trauma survivors are killing themselves. I am really upset about LivingInFearPTSD girl posting that she is killing herself. I hope she isn't dead but it looks like she is dead. I don't think I can go through another person on here killing themselves. Please don't anyone else on here kill themselves! I have been feeling just numb for the past couple of days (I couldn't/can't even feel sad) because she was pretty clear from some of her posts that that was her intention. I was having suicidal thoughts tonight in response so this. 

I was trying to tell her not to kill herself that a lot of us feel the same shame but it didn't work. We all fighting a very hard battle and struggling to survive ourselves and it is hard knowing that someone like us has died from it. Her posts over the last couple of days have really taken a toll on my mental health. It is a shame that society did not take her trauma more seriously and help her or prevent it from hapening. We all need to work to change the things in society like abusers/sexual abusers who are causing this PTSD that is killing people. 

I've personally taken steps to try to inform a mother and protect girls that were in the situation this poster was in from abuse. It's chilling to know that those kids could have ended up dead like this from their stepfather's abuse if I hadn't done that (and actually I don't necessarily know that I was able to protect them, they may have been abused and could still end up dead). I've been wishing I could take some MDMA after this incident (but at the same time I kind of don't want to get high because all my own trauma is going to come up on it and I can't deal with that right now) also I don't have any MDMA and I don't want to take it.

PTSD,"Lately I have been thinking about dignity and respect as survivors of trauma. This might seem like an odd post for this subreddit but I feel like it might not only be applicable to us here and but also extra applicable to us since many of our traumas (if they were interpersonal traumas such as rape, child abuse, or being trapped in a traumatic situation to further someone else's ends) were basically caused by people such as the person who attacked us not respecting us. 

I feel that this is also an important question and consideration since sometimes when you have an illness and especially one that affects you emotionally other people easily ""lose"" respect for you, particularly if they don't understand what you are going through. I think that this is one painful aspect of PTSD, watching other people who respected us before lose respect for us as a result of the PTSD symptoms. All our strength and hard work in living each day and putting out best foot forward in a challenging situation can easily go unseen except by the people who respect us. We can be compared to people who are not struggling with PTSD and all the hard work we are doing just to deal with our pain is invisible and can become discounted especially by people who want to believe that the world is a fair place and that it is a meritocracy (to some extent because they want to take credit for their success and where their hard work got them). It's easy to lose our sense of dignity when struggling with PTSD. 

I would like to hear your thoughts on this. What does respect mean to you ? Who has had respect for you and how have they shown it ? How can you tell when a person respects you ? What does a person who respects you say or do ? Can you give some examples ? What are your thoughts on respect ? Thank you in advance for any replies.

A couple years ago I was listening to a fun talk and I was off in my mind and then the woman giving the talk noticed that I wasn't there and stared at me very pointedly and determinedly as if to say, ""Come back here.""

Somehow I was thinking that this was going to be a great program but I didn't feel completely comfortable in the interview. A few of the things that the interviewer said and did set me on edge. For one thing I arrived late for my interview and I said, ""I'm so sorry about that."" After my telling her that I was a bit out of it because of the family difficulty the night before, the interviewer then turned it around to say, ""Well you were taking care of yourself good for you for coming late."" That really seemed ridiculous to me and made me feel really uncomfortable. Why are you congratulating me for being irresponsible and incompetent and coming late ? I didn't choose to come late it only happened because I was so depressed and sad and it's something that needs to be changed not celebrated. Edited to add (I've been feeling suicidal since talking to her yesterday.)


Then concerning some sexual harassment I had faced, she asked me how I had ""retaliated.""
The whole thing felt a bit uncomfortable because I felt like my feelings were wrong about what I had been through, like she was getting me to be more sad than I actually am and I was feeling like my feelings were wrong and that she knew my feelings better than I did. It felt like she had too much control in the interaction and I had too little. Logically the program looks good and I agree with it philosophically and everything but in terms of how it feels to me it in some ways it felt wrong. Usually I go with how I feel logically rather than my gut sense but that has not worked out well on a few occasions. I'm disappointed since I was looking forward to this and thinking that this would be good.

Other counsellors I have seen have refused to acknowledge that he did anything wrong which of course left me unable to trust them. 

It's getting to the point for me where I have almost given up seeking help. I am so demoralized. I feel awful. I notice that I have a very proactive approach towards my physical healthcare. I feel that physically taking care of myself is my responsibility and even if the doctor gives me the wrong advice about taking care of my body, I need to look out for myself and take responsibility because it will be me living with whatever consequences not the doctor. 

But in regard to my mental healthcare, it feels like I have learned helplessness. It is so hard to access help that it feels frustrating and out of my reach. It feels like my mental health is something that is not entirely in my control to take care of. It seems like I get and loose good mental healthcare arbitrarily and that it's something other people have control over rather than me. It's demoralizing to not have the tools and help I need to stay mentally healthy within reach. I feel like I can't take care of myself and good mental health is outside of my reach. I don't feel competent about taking care of myself mentally or proactive about my mental health but at the same time I can see that if I faced the obstacles in regard to my physical health that I do in regard to my mental health I would likely be extremely demoralized and may have given up on that too at this point rather than having the attitude that things are within my hands.

I feel like mental health is something that just happens to me, that other people do to me which is outside of my control and if other people are just nice enough love can fix my problems. I feel that I have come to be quite unproactive about my mental health. Does anyone else feel the same ?

This is so different however from how I relate to my physical health which I am very proactive about. I feel that my body is mine and I am in a way alone with it if it is diseased, no one can save me from myself so I need to take care of myself. I'm the one that is going to suffer if I don't take care of my physical body not other people, not the doctors. I feel that it is my responsibility to take care of my physical body.

PTSD,"How do you all deal with the effects of your PTSD symptoms on those around you/those you care about ? And how do you deal with the effects on your own self esteem ? 

I realize that rationally dealing with my PTSD symptoms is like dealing with someone who can't stop throwing up. They throw up where ever you go with them, and all over the building at work and on your nice rug and they throw up on the floor and you have to clean it up and you have to make sure you're not in your nice clothes around them. 

I hate that I'm the one throwing up on the floor and getting it dirty for other people AND of course I feel absolutely 100x more awful from throwing up all the time in the first place and wish I could be well so much :( Knowing that you are getting someone's floor dirty doesn't help with the shame of PTSD either. I am really fed up of having this, I want this to end. Sometimes I feel suicidal.

I was getting counselling for things but then I tried to be open with someone else about what I was confronting and he just didn't believe me or want to help. I felt like he saw me as a liar. The shame since then has been overwhelming (and I stopped getting counselling and have been afraid to go back because the world just can't deal with this) and I've kind of given up hope that people can understand me. I've also felt a lot of anger towards people for not believing or helping me. I just feel so ashamed and I feel that people won't believe me, I can't bear to be with my friends and I feel alienated from them.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Does anyone feel helpless ? I feel helpless. I've been trying to fix whatever is going on with me for 4 years and despite what I try it always seems nothing seems helpful. A lot of family members have said that they don't believe me and I feel like every time I try to help myself I get cut down by someone who doesn't care, people are not only not helping but actively cutting me down and telling me I'm wrong/lying. I feel like I just can't handle it. I can't handle being cut down anymore. I don't think I can trust anyone again.

I know a lot of people have tried to be helpful but I can't explain to them that it's hard to not just crumble in shame and not be able to get up off the floor or accept their help in any way when you have multiple people calling you a liar and trying to shame you. I feel like people can't understand that how difficult it is to deal with the shame and how much it makes me hate myself and completely paralyzes me. People think that other people shaming me and not believing me is no big deal but it really hurts. I feel like people blame me instead for being lazy.

I do feel like I have to take responsibility for my life though and know that my life is my responsibility to direct. I just feel so frustrated and helpless though. 

I do really feel that I have to take responsibility for my life though. If I don't fix things I will suffer. I just don't want to be blamed for it though. I am also just finding it so hard to have to motivation to work hard on fixing my life. I know that I need to work hard but I just can't seem to find that drive to do it within myself anymore.",lovinglily

This article is titled: ""Trailblazing the continent on foot, raising awareness of child sex abuse""
Some excerpts: CBeebies actor Matthew McVarish, himself the victim of an abusive uncle, is taking a 16,000km trek to raise awareness of the problem
A star of the BBC children’s programme ‘Me Too!’, McVarish also works as the European ambassador for the non-profit organisation Stop the Silence: Stop Child Sexual Abuse. He said he views his trip around Europe as one of the responsibilities of the position.
McVarish pointed out, however, that his intentions weren’t to drag out the past for him or for anyone he meets on the road. Instead, he hopes to help prevent cases of abuse in the future by encouraging victims to speak up.
“I’ve spoken to thousands of survivors on my walk, and I ask them if they’ve ever talked to the police. Many say that they don’t feel strong enough to stand in the same courtroom as the person who abused them,” he said.
“I completely understand that, because it’s very difficult,” he went on. “But I ask them: ‘Do you think you’re stronger as an adult than the child that same person might abuse tonight, or tomorrow, or next week?’ It’s not about seeking revenge or compensation, it’s about child protection right now.”
Stopping the silence
In each city he visits, McVarish meets with public officials to encourage policy change, particularly in regards to the respective country’s statute of limitations for reporting cases of child sex abuse. While no statute exists in McVarish’s home country, it is currently set at ten years in Denmark and varies throughout Europe.
“There will always be cases just outside of the bracket, no matter the amount of time,” McVarish said. “And the person who abused them could still be out walking the streets.”
But the main focus of his walk, McVarish pointed out, is to facilitate open discussions about abuse in communities where the topic is seldom addressed.
“There are an estimated 100 million abuse survivors in Europe, many of them in rural areas. So for their local paper to have a guy on the front page talking about sex abuse not as a scandal, but just trying to deal with it, can be very valuable.”

PTSD,"I have gone through some very difficult things with my fundamentalist religious parents. For a long time I have felt like the things that they do violate my sense of morality/conscience. See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1muroe/dealing_with_traumatic_events_how_to_deal_kind_of/) for an example. I feel like I cannot take the pain of how they treat me and also how they treat other people anymore. I am considering ending things with them but it is difficult for me. I care about them to some extent as well, and I am also terrified of society's opprobrium/anger disapproval towards anyone who would make a break with family. I am an INTP. I wanted to ask some NFs their thoughts on this because I am inclined to want to do non traditional things and ""innovate"" being an N. I don't understand why I should have to follow social convention and stay close to my family no matter what, logically it makes no sense and seems ridiculous, but then being an INTP I'm not terribly aware of and good at managing feelings. I'm not good at budgeting for my and others emotional needs. I've had my bf tell me it's not a good idea to leave and it's really hard not to listen to him. A few counsellors I talked to were not in favour of me leaving even though the relationship is bad and hurting me because they thought that I was, ""too upset about it, it seems kind of like you want to leave but you don't."" One counsellor thought it was a good idea. It was hard for me to know whether these counsellors were uncomfortable with the idea because of tradition and ""family above all else"" which it seems most people in our society adhere to or something else. 

So I wanted to ask some NFs your thoughts, because I figure you all are likely to have a better grip on feelings than me and also to not be locked into tradition at all costs. Have any of you ever done this or watched any of your friends do this ? How did you feel about it ?

Edit: I want to ask this, I feel that I can do a sort of logical costs benefits analysis about leaving my family versus staying but emotionally it's hard for me to have a sense of it, it's hard for me to size it up in an emotionally engaged way. It's hard for me to feel the situation as a whole. I can feel parts of it, like the benefits and then the costs of it but I can't feel it all together.

PTSD,"I can handle J types neatness and organization etc. I notice I find it hard to deal with their certainty about things. I often find it comes across as either arrogant and overly certain. I often feel like J types get my back up against a wall and I feel cornered and stubborn. Also their ways of communicating/advocating their points don't appeal to me. The more certain they get about the point that they are making and that they are right, the more resistant I feel to what they are saying. Does anyone else feel the same ? It's a lot easier for someone to get me to listen if they appeal to uncertainty, and say, ""Well I can't be certain that you are right."" I find that of course quite intriguing/interesting.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Firstly let me say, this is difficult to deal with the following as an INTP because I'm not good at sensing and talking about my feelings. The INTP drive for knowledge and, ""If I find out enough I'll be competent and I just need to learn everything to deal with this. The more upset I get the more knowledge I try to gather"" means that I just read more and more upsetting statistics and upsetting stories, and not being super in tune with feelings I just process things rationally and I don't even have a great grasp on how much my continuing delving into this is upsetting me. Not to mention the INTP ""The truth is what matters I have to find out the truth"" and paying attention to logic and making decisions by logic rather than taking feelings (my feelings) into consideration. 

I'm 29, I was sexually abused by a guy in my church when I was 7 and a couple years ago the same man married a woman with children from a previous marriage. My parents fucking knew what happened with me (I told them when I was 7 because the whole ""Keeping a secret thing seemed illogical/pretentious/grated on my truthful ""I hate pretending"" logical self"") and said nothing/did nothing to intervene. A bunch of people knew and did nothing. 

It was basically hell for me to try to get anyone to listen and get those kids away from him. People's attitudes (including numerous counsellors (more like 7 of them) I have been to, YES I have talked to a counsellor about this, but they are mostly F types which I will get to in a minute) and apathy towards this issue is just unbelievable. Everyone is all ""Oh I'm against child abuse"" but when it happens no one wants to lift a finger to help. 

As an INTP I have a low tolerance for fakeness and the fakeness upsets me. I really don't ""get"" it about the Fs just being ""nice"" and saying things that they don't believe in to make everyone ""feel nice."" And I don't get it about the S types just not wanting to rock the boat and just go along with things as they've always been done, you know we want to be conventional, and I've never seen someone talk about sexual abuse before or take steps to deal with it and I don't want to be the first. I don't understand why people can't just do the right thing. 



It really irritates me that this is all about being socially/politically correct to most people and there's no ""truth"" in it and conviction about the truth in it, and everyone is so fake competent at dealing with it. Everyone knows exactly which boxes to tick off and all the right fake words to say to convince everyone they are politically correct. It's all just a fucking social game to people. 


I wish every person that says they ""CARE"" about this but doesn't would just get rid of themselves honestly. ~7 counsellors heard about this from me, they are legally obligated to report it but none of them did. They all told ""me"" to report it. I eventually did report it to a hotline even though I am the person who suffered through this myself and for whom it is hardest to talk about this and expose myself. The kids are now away from this man, apparently the mother finally listened (and my parents finally spoke up) and left him. It's not just the perpetrators who cause this to continue to happen it's the people who say, ""oh I'm a good person. I would stand up against that"" and then do nothing and want to protect perpetrators. I wish not only the perpetrators but those fake people who say they care but they don't were in hell where they were having to relive the abuse they put other people through every single day until they figure it the fuck out that it's wrong and stop with the fakeness.

Dealing with a situation like this is clearly not my strong suit (?) or area of competence at all. 

Edit:  ~7 counsellors heard about this from me, they are legally obligated to report it but NONE of them did. Why did you sign up to be a counsellor and agree to report things like this and what the fuck did they teach you in psychology/counselling school if it makes you too uncomfortable to deal with stuff like this ? They are there to make money, play peekabo with people and do nothing productive whatsoever.

I was incidentally seeing a therapist at the time and I brought up the childhood sexual abuse with him but he didn't want to talk about it/help me with it.



As if that wasn't enough the abuser contacted me shortly afterwards trying to add me on Facebook. Then I learned that he had married a woman from my (former) church who had little children from her marriage before. My fundamentalist Christian parents who knew what he did to me, did nothing to try and help/remove this kids and that really broke my heart (they knew even before me that this predator was marrying this woman with children and they didn't care to do anything).
I told everyone in the church and my entire extended family about the abuse and that this man was kids to try to protect them almost even though I didn't want to expose myself. It was like PTSD flashbacks to feel that this was happening to another kid again.



Personally I don't know how far I would have gone in reporting this man and exposing everything to the light. I have horrible feelings about speaking up, I felt (/feel) quite ashamed and went far beyond what I was comfortable with trying to report this stuff. I did it partly because after the PTSD blew up I just stopped giving a f%&*, I want social support but I just don't have the motivation.

I just don't care, I don't care to do all the social niceties and be polite and generally fit in in society.

I don't want to sit down and be cute and get people's approval anymore, it just doesn't mean that much to me as hard as I try for it to mean something it just doesn't.

It feels like a trauma just to be alive, I don't want to live on this planet with people.



I don't give a f&%*. I can't remember feeling this apathetic at any point in my life before. I feel that I can't trust in people anymore. I just don't care to make any sort of working relationship with anyone work. I'm not pushing anyone away (people are jerks enough as it is) but I'm not editing myself or making myself approvable either. I feel like with friends like my best friend and parents and church, why even bother ? With friends like that who needs enemies ? I'm not doing anything horrible to people but I don't feel like I'll ever have a real honest connection with anyone anymore.



Whether people can understand the situation you are in and be on your side just seems so arbitrary.

So I've done a few things since I made the last post without any progress on the issue.


The core issue is the same. When I start the engine, the engine usually idles up to 2000+. It will sometimes pulse down a bit by 100 or so rpm every 10 seconds, but generally doesn't move unless I open the throttle which increases proportionately from 2000+.  I've replaced the IACV, because if the throttle is closed and it's getting high RPM, it seems that the IACV would be open too far.  Someone suggested I try unplugging the TPS and testing it. That went well, because if I unplug the TPS, the engine will start normally. I can then plug the TPS back in and the engine will behave normally. If I start the engine and THEN unplug the TPS, the engine will drop down to normal, but seems to work its way back up when I plug it back in. (I may not be letting it settle down enough.) Because of this, I replaced the TPS, but that didn't result in a change to the behavior.


I've sprayed some throttle body cleaner around the vacuum hoses while the engine was running at 200+ rpm without any noticeable changes. I'll try it when the TPS is disconnected tomorrow, but it doesn't seem to be a vacuum issue. (I could still be wrong. I'll check when there's sunlight and warm air)


I don't normally get any codes unless I start the engine without the TPS plugged in. I configured my scangauge to read from O2 sensor 1-1 and 2-1. IIRC, 2-1 is showing a number shuffling between ~0-5%. 1-1 is reporting a number that keeps bouncing from ~0-90%. I have NO idea what 'normal' is. All I can determine is that I have a brand new IACV that is being held open for some reason if I start the engine with the brand new TPS plugged in. If I start the engine without the TPS, THEN plug it in, everything is fine, but I have the same isue the next time I try to start the engine.


edit1: The TPS output on my scangauge is showing 20 without my foot on the gas.

Ideas?

PTSD,"I just replaced the IACV and the behavior seems to be somewhat worse. Normally, I'll start the engine and it will rapidly reduce idle to a stable ~1000-1200 rpm. When I put it in reverse or drive, it drops to a stable ~625-700.  The current mode, however is that i'll start the engine and it will rev to 2000-2400 and stay for at least a couple of minutes. Sometimes it will slowly drop to ~1200 over a couple of minutes. Sometimes it stays high. Given a new IACV, what are my options of other issues. I've pulled the PCV and it appears to be working happily. The air filter was changed in the last month. There doesn't seem to be a meaningful change in behavior when it switched from open to closed loop. Coolant temp is a stable -2F from Cylinder head temp.

PTSD,"I'm trying to further narrow down possibilities for why my tuck doesn't like to start and I've come up with a few additional questions to try to narrow the possibilities. Here's the situation:

Truck: 2001 F-250 5.4 Gas with ~170k miles.
plugs, fuel filter, battery, relevant fluids have all been changed within the last 6 months.

Symptoms: Cranks, but only occasionally starts.
No firing noise whatsoever most of the time, it just spins and mocks me.
Starter fluid seems to get it going most of the time, but the sounds it makes make me feel bad about myself when it does.
It sounds like it's rotating normally, but just not actually attempting to catch.
When it does start, it runs fine without any detectable issues.
Idle speed is perfectly normal. After it warms up for a minute, the idle speed drops from ~850 to ~650 as it always has.
No OBD2 codes are showing.
All cylinders are firing, I can drive it for an hour without a hint of problem.
Once I shut it down, it's been prone to restarting easily, but not always.
Coolant temperature increases at the normal rate.
It might be more prone to starting correctly if I give it some gas during ignition, but if it tries to catch and fails, it's done and won't even try the next time.

Questions: The last time I posted, the following suggestions were made:
Clean MAF
Clean Throttle body
Vacuum hose leak
IACV
Injector cleaner

I've added injector cleaner, but that's not an immediate fix.

My understanding was that the PCV valves and hoses weren't a meaningful part of the ignition process. Could a dodgy PCV valve or leaky PCV hose be preventing the engine from trying to catch? Are there any other vacuum hoses involved? I have two hoses from the air intake to the sides of the engine. I'm assuming those are the PCV hoses and valves. 

If the engine runs properly once it's started, can I completely rule out fuel pump and fuel line related problems? Can the injectors work on vacuum pressure with no fuel pump?

If I don't get ignition if the gas pedal is held down when starting, is the throttle or IACV still likely to be a possibility? My understanding is that the IACV is basically a throttle bypass with automatic adjustment to keep the engine running when there's no throttle. If the throttle is fully open and it fails to start, these two components should be ruled out, no? If the truck idles properly and adjusts RPM normally after it warms up, IACV should be fine?

Is it possible to flood this engine while failing to start it? Could this be aggravating troubleshooting?

I greatly appreciate the help with this. I'm super low on cash right now and can't afford to blow the money on a mechanic right now.

Edit: PCV stuff. My knowledge is dodgy.

PTSD,"Howdy from frozen Texas.

I'm not sure what the important bits are, but here's my situation.

I have a 5.4L Gas F-250 with ~170k miles. It has decided not to start on me reliably. The engine turns over, but doesn't actually seem to catch. When this happened earlier this week, I sprayed some starter fluid in the air intake, and after a few seconds of confusion, it started and ran normally. The next half dozen starts went normally, but it's back to mocking me as I freeze in the driveway.

In the last 6 months, I've had all of the fluids replaced except the xfer case, and rear diff. Oil was changed (5w20 full synthetic) 10 days ago. New plugs in August along with two new ignition coils. New fuel filter in August as well, IIRC. The air filter has about 10k miles on it and looks reasonably clean. I'm getting no OBD2 codes.

Is this possibly some function of age vs sub-freezing temperatures or is there some other obvious issue? The last time this happened, it seemed to be prompted by my releasing the starter JUST as the motor started to catch. It's been all downhill from there.

I did get support in form of clothes, toys, food, laundry, etc., as long as I did what they wanted, though. Disobey and there is no place in our home for you.

The moment when I needed emotional support, I kept as far away from my parents as I could. They would mock me for needing it, curse me for being who I was or punish me for... I don't know... being alive?
Anyways, I grew up as this little ms. Perfect, little ms. Know-it-all. I knew how to be well-behaved and moreover I knew how to be Grown-Up. My parents acted like children; irrational, needy and inconsequent. So I did what I had to do to protect myself: I learned to forgive, I learned to be compassionate, I learned to give without receiving. I was well-spoken, I thought about Life and I was ever so kind. 
They complained I was too serious. I guess they were right. I didn't like kids, I liked rules and logic. Teachers liked me. I have been the Good Example on many an occasion.



Now, I am a grown-up. Or, better said, I should at least be somewhat grown-up now, I'm almost 30. I'm not a grown-up grown-up, though, I am a child grown-up.

Now that I am safe, my life is in my own hands – which I can almost feel some days –, I feel more like a child than ever. I am so angry. So angry at the past. So sad. So touched by every feeling of connectedness with another human being. I want this world to be mine. I don't want other people to be mean anymore. I won't allow it. I want puppies and rainbows forever. I want you to love me and build sand castles together and when I'm tired of playing with you, you may not complain, because it is My World.

It is weird to experience the world upside down, since I already know what comes after. I already know that I should respect others beings, can't discard them as a wish, that always play, doesn't make a person happy and that after hating all the world, I will have compassion for it. 
I feel like a child. But a child that knows too much. A child grown-up. It takes away from the journey if you know where it will end.




I walk this way. I will try. Because when I'm finally a grown-up grown-up, I hope it will not be as desolate as being a grown-up child and not as confusing as being a child grown-up.",lddvd
PTSD,"Hey guys & gals,

I've been trying to feel better today since I'm very, very tense at the moment, but isn't working at all. I just want to share my day with you. Thanks for reading.

I visited 2 appartments yesterday for which I was invited by the housing office. For both appartments I'm 3rd on the waiting list, so now I have to wait and see if the people before me accept the appartment(s) or not.
I saw my therapist today and she said everybody would be nervous in a situation like this, but I'm not just nervous, I'm in panic. There is nothing to be panicking about. I have a nice home. It's just that being in an uncertain situation and having others to decide over how my life will look, triggers me enormously. At noon I already felt like it was 23 p.m., I'm constantly on the verge of crying, I can't focus for more than 15 secs. and I'm very restless.
I know that it's not productive and unnecessary at best, but my body is in switching between fight and flight and it's wearing me out.

A heads up would be nice, but if you have any advice; that's welcome too. I don't know how long I must wait before I know what the verdict is. Might be an hour, might be a week. But in the meantime I don't feel capable of continuing my (daily) life.
Hope you guys/gals here understand this. That would be a great relief.",lddvd
PTSD,"I have CPTSD. My parents were emotionally far from capable to raise kids. They raised three, though.

Today I had an appointment at a government office that offered help to file my tax files. Luckily I was ill earlier this week, so my mind forgot about it until yesterday. Since yesterday midday I'm feeling panic. I did nothing even slightly illegal with my money, I even have so little that even if I did, the people at that office would probably consider it cute instead of theft. Anyways, it doesn't calm me down. I have an appointment with The Big Bad Government that can do to me as they wish. It feels like attending the principals office. Even though I did nothing wrong, I'm not sure I will be punished or only scolded. As my parents used to do. I try to calm myself. Everything is okay. Still, since noon I feel enstranged from myself and the world. The world is like a dream to me. Everything seems off. Dissociation.

A couple hours before the meeting I check my telephone for the time again and again, since my feeling of time is gone. You could easily tell me it's already evening or the day after today. I set an alarm an hour before the meeting so I can't forget. My mind tries hard, though. An hour and a half before the meeting, I don't check the time anymore, I don't dare to think anymore, I feel freezed. I manage to flick on autopilot, I check the last things, gather the needed stuff and go.

The meeting is weird. The guy helping me is kidding and laughing. He asks me if I'm sure I get a disabilty benefits, since I don't look disabled. I'm sure I get them. I let him fill in the tax form. I give him the information that he needs. It takes much effort; my eyes don't really see what's on the paper, my brain is too stressed to process the information, my hands are trembling and all I want to do is throw  my papers on the floor crying and punch everything around me. Instead I smile back. I engage in a talk with the guy about the difference of university and applied university. I manage to only ask a couple of wary questions. He looks puzzled, uncertain. I excuse myself.

The guy is happy. His calculations say that I will get a refund of almost thousand euros. He looks at me. I'm not happy. He is confused by my lack of joy or even relief. That makes him recalculate. My reaction clearly must be a sign that this can not be the case. I assure him, that he is probably right. He recalculates, doesn't find any errors and gets even more happy. Like a labrador. I sit like a ghost and smile for his sake.
I'm home. I'm still feeling dreamy. Relieved that it is over? No. For me it feels like the end of a scolding. I'm not punished this time. I even get some praise. I don't want it. Keep your damn money. Just leave me alone. Just leave me alone. I would give you 1000 euros not to relive this nightmare of being incarcenated in my childhood home, my parents as guards, gloom as my constant companion.

PTSD,"Hey,

I feel hurt by a friend and I could use some heads up, so I hoped you guys would listen to my rambling. Thanks in advance for your time and input. :)


I have a friend H and a friend A. And friend H has had a quite straightforward, relatively problem free childhood and life so far. Friend A and I have had our rough patches in childhood and later on. She has been emotionally and physically abused by her schizophrenic dad and has had several depressions. I have been emotionally abused by my parents; mother with borderline, dad with undiagnosed severe emotional problems, and that led to several depressions and PTSD. My childhood was a lonely one, there was noone to support me, my parents have never been any support, had no people around me that saw what I had to endure, since my parents are very good at looking succesful and rational to others. The last 9 years I have worked very hard on my problems in therapy and I came further than I ever imagined was possible.


Thing is H tends to talk to me about how he feels sorry for A. And that's okay, I mean, I sincerely wish A a stable life, a job, a good relationship, nice kids, a warm home. Lately she stoppes with her studies without having a degree. She really tried hard, but her emotional problems broke her up. I feel for her, I do, I know how it feels. But H goes on and on about what a pity it is and how he feels really sad about it and that he worries because now she will never have much money to live from and that she has spend so much on education and doesn't have a degree now. I think that's not really true; the state gives everyone at least 800 euros a month for living expenses when they can't earn that kind of money themselves, which is not much, but enough to live a good live from. Next to that she has an income now, her mother gives her a montly wage, her father has lots of money from which he gives to her, her fiance probably will become a teacher in high school in a year or so, she doesn't need a baby sitter since her mom supports her very much and would love to take care of her future kids, she paid a large part of her education with inheritance money.


I don't get a penny from anyone but the state. That's okay. I feel very lucky that I live somewhere where I get a basic income. My parents have been quite rich when I was a kid, but never put that to my education or life, they spend it on expensive hotels and trips and design furniture. I never had any support from anyone that I didn't pay for (such as therapists). I mean, my financial situation is okay, I can live well and even do extra things sometimes, but compared with A I really drew the shorter straw, especially in having support. There is noone to support me and that feels very lonely. I don't mind the money, but the feeling that somebody cares enough. Difference is that I count my blessings and that she tends to complain about what she has and that we spend our money differently. She buys a lot of stuff like clothing, jewelry, games, books, season tickets etc. I haven't even bought books for my studies because I couldn't afford that. A tends to talk a lot about how she doesn't have money for certain things and I don't. I told H about my financial situation, but it doesn't seem to stick since I don't talk about it every time I see him and I put my money in ordering pizza when he comes over, because I know he loves that and I do too.


I just can't stand H talking about A all the time to me. I've worked so hard to be where I am, I have taken so much pain in my life, but because I don't like to put my worries onto others, others don't tend to see my hardships. And I'm so hurt by that.


I know you guys can't change a thing about this. I might give H's address so you can beat him up over it (kidding). It just feels good that anyone would listen.


And for the people that recognize the situation; I found a relevant quote that touched me some time ago:
Ernest Hemingway — 'You are so brave and quiet I forget you are suffering.'


**TLDR; Friend H is sorry for friend A. Can't stand hearing about it time and time again, since I think my situation is even harder, but I'm just a less complaining person.**",lddvd

PTSD,"**I broke up with the love of my life about 2 months ago now. And I'm in a rough spot. I love him dearly, he loves me.** 





*The reason I can't carry on this relationship is because I've been raised by my mum and dad whom both have untreated mental issues, I'm diagnosed with PTSD due to emotional neglect.* 

*My ex is a socially awkward person, he is one of those persons in high school that everybody knew because he was different. I don't mind that, I love him for who he is. But the way he interacts socially hurt me a lot. Even his friends tend to be insecure around him, never knowing whether he likes them or finds them ridiculous. His behaviour and my issues is a recipe for disaster.*


*For the last 10 years I've been following a lot of therapies and I worked very hard to solve my issues. I learned to talk about what I feel, I learned to trust that he loves me, I learned to take care of myself emotionally. I'm still not very good at this, but I try very hard and it took more courage than I thought I had.*

*Still, it's not enough to make our relationship work. I know it's the one thing that people say you shouldn't want, but I need him to change. I can't do this alone, I'm at the end of what I can do alone. I need him to do it with me, so I can trust that this is something we do together. So I don't feel so damn alone in our relationship. He won't. He tells me time and time that he will, that he thinks I'm right, that he wants to work hard, because he loves me and doesn't want to hurt me, etc., etc. But in the end, he just doesn't want to change. He takes no initiative whatsoever, when I propose to try relationship counseling or doing a course he tries everything to avoid it and when I finally get him so far to have counselling with me he doesn't really participate or he only participates in the therapists room, but forgets everything as soon as we leave.*

*This hurts so much. And I can't do this on my own. I have done everything I could alone and now I'm done. I'm just done. I still love him so much, if I could I would really change myself not to be hurt by his way of social interaction. But I can't. It has come to the point that the hurt makes me stuck in life. It takes so much of my energy and confidence. And I can't let that happen. The place I was in before I got in therapy was bad enough to try to end my life. That's no way to live.*

---

*So, here I am now. About 2 months ago I broke it off and since then I only have sent him a couple of messages and called twice to explain the why and to arrange to get my stuff back and give him his stuff.*





**This week has been extra tough. I just can't get myself to do anything. The house is a big mess, I forget to take my medicine a lot, I forget to eat, I only feed my pets, sleep and try to take my mind of things by playing games. What makes it hard is the lack of support I get of friends, I guess. To be honest, I'm very bad at asking, but when I do try to talk about what's going on in my life, they change the subject as soon as they can to their own troubles.** 


*And my therapists think it is a very important step for me this, that I have to move on. I just don't know how. I feel so lost. I know that there is a whole world for me out there, but I just want to share that with my ex.*


**I really want to connect with other people, but I'm so very bad at it and it seems that they are even worse at it or just don't feel the need for it as much as I do. I want for once in my life to be hold, to be truly hold in someones arms. But it seems that noone wants to hold me or knows how. Everybody is so busy with there own problems. And I listen and I try to support. But if not from my ex, from whom do I get my support? I don't need very much. I just want to feel cared for. When I feel supported and loved, I have enough strenght to take care of myself. But I don't know how to go on when I feel this alone.**

**Thanks for reading.**

Having dug in the area previously to remove large weeds I have never encountered any evidence of them below the surface.



I have been putting off resurfacing an area, 4x6 metres, in my yard due to a colony of exceptionally cute mining bees for the last four years. I have been trying to improve the soil and fix bare patches over time but my garden is very shaded and damp with heavy clay soil so it's a losing battle. For the last year I've been replacing the sad grass around the edges with alternative and more suitable ground covers (lawn camomile, Corsican mint, Irish moss).


Each April my bee buddies reappear, approximately 150 holes in that area. They get busy excavating and clear a circular area around each hole about 3cm wide destroying grass in the process and by around july they have filled them all in and vanished again.

I have previously identified the bees, but can't remember the name and they are protected and now listed as living here but no one told me to mind them or not disturb the area they were in.

Basically I'm afraid if I disturb the top 10-15cm of soil and amend it away from the heavy clay it is now I'll kill them all.

I want to plant clover and other grass alternatives. I want to do that if anything to help wild life!

I always have an interest and a concern in where the porn I watch is coming from.


For as long as I can remember looking at porn (1997) the only substantial guilt or shame I experienced was and is due to the human element. 

*How does this actress feel after having that happen. Are they hurting her? Did she really consent. Is she being taken advantage of. Is this impacting her life in a very negative way?*


I know it's come up here, sometimes actresses are clearly on a lot of drugs.

The rare times I stumble on to videos where I doubt consent was obtained I genuinely feel anxiety, guilt and nuasea for weeks afterwards. I don't know what you're meant to do either with regards reporting.


I think if porn was genuinely being aimed at a female demographic there would be more human interest info on the actors involved and I do think women would have an empathy towards the actors that would encourage more candid  interviews.

The main problem was that despite me explaining that my ptsd effects how I respond to sedation, they laughed and said that was impossible.

This had happened before.

I have been told by various psychiatric staff that it can be an issue, particularly for people who had extended periods of truama from a young age because your brain basically developed in constant disaster so how it and your body releases various hormones and respond to things is changed on a physiological level.


My first appointment for my up coming surgery went badly, the staff member I spoke with was clearly badly trained and I had a massive flashback, worst one in months. I ended up hiding under a cistern in a public toilet not able to move for about 30 minutes till my grounding exercises took effect. (How embarrassing is it when stuff like that happens!)

I went in today to the anaesthetic clinic and they were *amazing* they took my ptsd very seriously said it was very important that I explained it to them, that they completely understood and would try and give me long acting heavier sedation post op.

They said they would observe me post op because some of the procedure will be done on my reproductive organs via my genitals. I had explained that waking up with those regions sore in a strange environment might make me freak out. Again, they were lovely about it.

The anaesthetist said that people with severe trauma can show signs of it during their surgery! That they snap their jaws and fight the paralytics, , spasm, tense muscles and try to move a lot more then expected.

I never knew that.

PTSD,"Bit of back ground. I have ptsd mostly from sexual traumas (there will be **no** details included). 

I was diagnosed with endo over ten years ago and had it removed. Since then my ptsd symptoms went through the roof for various reasons and I have been hospitalised several times for it. Needless to say I did not want any one going near my genitals.

So for the last eight years or so I've just been knocking back painkillers and iron supplements.

But for the last two years I've been working *really* hard to get my symptoms under control and work through my traumatic memories.

That started with going to get my eyes tested, which went ok. Getting my hair cut professionally. And going to the dentist (who was unbelievably nice and professional about the accommodations I need in order to stay calm). I had not done any of these things in eight years because strangers being up in my personal space caused flashbacks.

Any way...

There was some kind of disaster in the operating theatre. Which is awful for the people involved.

But that meant I had a five hour wait after my appointment was scheduled to be.

After five hours of waiting the sedatives I had been given by my psychiatrist had worn off.

Went in, it wasn't the woman I had been referred to. 

We sat down and I explained my situation. I also explained that I would need STD testing etc.

After All the usual  period related questions she asked me if I had filed charges.

I was really agitated and upset at this point, but had yet to crack into showing emotions.

I said no. 

She said if I was raped the police would have filed charges. 

I said I didn't go to the police but that the local health services knew.

By now I can't breath properly. The room is barely registering with me. Her voice is like a song you cant hear the words to but you know so well you just fill in the blanks. I was shaking and sobbing.

I had done so well, I had planned what I was going to say. I wasn't going to discuss stuff in detail right before someone started shoving stuff up bits of me. And it was all gone to poop.

All she had to say to finish me off was *People who are raped phone the police, you didn't?*

In response to my distress she started pushing hair behind my ears and stroking my side and I just wanted everything to stop. I felt like I was going to vomit.


She did not do a pelvic exam.

But she did get me to sign loads of stuff and gave me an envelope and sent me on my way.

I ended up in a heap on the floor of a toilet crying and trying to ground myself in the present and away from my flashback horrors.

So I get home and try and mind myself a bit. Do nice things. Relax. Remind myself I can try again. Try to not get caught up too much in my emotions.

I looked in the envelope this morning though.


She had gotten me to sign f*cking consent forms for an operation while I was  sobbing in front of her and non coherent. Including insertion of some IUD or something along with other stuff I haven't a clue about.



In the past I would have just not turned up for the operation, never gone back, never had a hair cut, a dental appointment. Any thing.

But I have worked really fecking hard.

Screw that shit.

It's not OK for someone whose job involves dealing with womens plumbing day in day out to not know how to interact with a person who has suffered sexual trauma. 

So I phoned up (playing phone number pin ball around the hospital till I got the right person) and said I had no idea what I had signed. That I wasn't willing to have an operation without having my questions answered or a pelvic exam done.

I have organised to see the gyno I was actually referred to privately, which will cost a bit. And take a while.

Any way. I'm fairly proud of myself.

PTSD,"I come from a very dysfunctional family.

Both parents were terribly abusive and as a result I have never understood that connection many others feel towards family.

When I think of mothers and fathers and children my mind isn't filled with fond memories, it's filled with revulsion.

As a result it's not something I often thought about. But I knew I was never drawn to the idea in any biological sense.

I've made this fairly well known. I'm 31 so I have a fair amount of experience of being asked when will I have kids, or do I want them. And the answer is normally ""no"" or I don't think so.

Add to this a myriad of medical, psychological and personal problems and the idea of having a kid, at least any time soon seems like a bad one.

I haven't had a happy life. I'm just starting to try and make a move to improve it and I want to finally have nice things, go out, enjoy my body and my time while I have it.


Add to that I have from a young age felt that people having children for the sake of it is a bad idea and have been aware of the environmental, social and ethical problems of overpopulation.

I have however been told I'm a *born mother* since I was very young and would probably be a good parent and have predominantly worked in caring professions.


Step in long term BF (8 years) who has known me since I was 15. 

Last week he said, pretty much out of no where, he wants kids and if I don't he doesn't know how we can continue.

He works part time, we live in a dive, I'm too sick to work the last three years and our life is generally a mess.

I love him to bits, but it's currently not an equal relationship. 

I do all the; cleaning, shopping, home maintenance, cooking, financial management, laundry and any important phone calls and date keeping. I'm basically a mother already. I receive social welfare and all but €30 out of €198 of that a week goes towards rent, bills and groceries.

So I told him I'm currently in no position to make that decision right now and if I had to, it would be no.

I said I needed to get my life back together. That I would never consider having a child with someone who could sit playing video games while I painted the house alone or never seemed to find issue with having never cleaned so much as a counter without having to be asked first. 

We agreed on a list of day to day changes that need to happen to improve our relationship.

He agreed to give me time to swap my sh*it coloured glasses for some rose ones so I can make a proper decision.

Till then I guess I don't really know. Maybe if life seems good having kids will too.

I imagine it's mostly disaster stories when it comes to this issue.

I've been working towards doing this kind of thing for a really long time.

I just asked in a WhatsApp group of my friends who would like to do something day time today and went with it.

She's cycling there and I'm getting a bus and a city train.


It's been years since I've done this kind of thing.

I normally only socialise when I feel obliged to.

I feel awkward and weird around people often and sometimes it makes Me feel sad because I used to feel fine and their lives being on track made me feel like a failure.

I also have ptsd and public travel alone can be difficult at times due to my symptoms.


But I'll never get back to enjoying socialising if I don't do it, and it will never feel free of some spite at having to do it if I don't arrange it myself.

On the one hand it is a rich source of nectar.

But on the other I've heard that due to poor foliage it does not support caterpillars.

I was under the impression butterflies layed on specific plants their larvae would be nourished by depending on species. Why would they lay their eggs on the wrong plant type and is this a large enough concern to counter the benefits of a rich nectar source?

It seems to grow very easily. 

It provides food for pollinators, although I've heard that because it doesn't provide enough foliage for caterpillars it's bad? Not really sure. I have lots of plants caterpillars love eating that I've never seen butterflies take an interest in.


So in areas where little else grows is it an ok plant to use?

I mean it grows *everywhere* here already dotted about. 



------------------

From here on out it's me rambling on about the area I'm considering planting it (ignorable)

-------------------

I particularly want to make unpleasant and ugly places nicer. 

There is a bank of soil in a lane near my house that has heavy foot traffic but looks and feels terrible.

The bank in question is about five foot high with a gentle incline, maybe ten foot wide in places including two to four foot flat and level on top.

It bakes hard and dry in the sun and turns to slush in the winter due to the clay soil in my area.

All that ever successfully grows there is nettles when left to it's own devices. I cut them all back earlier this year and turned the soil. This year some nasturtiums and calendula have taken for me. But they're struggling. I know nettles are a sign of high nitrogen but there's not much I can do to amend the soil.

It's long (40 years) been a popular area for teens to drink and the soil is riddled with glass and happy fat rats frequent the rubbish people dump there.


I've just put down a lot of poppy and forgetmenot seeds as well as edging with spare crocosmia i had.

I don't have the time or energy to weed the area again, but since being cleared three months ago weeds are returning.


I think buddleia would be nice there. I don't know how controversial it is, but personally if in five years it took over the whole bank I think it would still be better than how it currently looks. Still not sure it's a good idea though.",BallPointPariah
PTSD,"Is this normal?

I got it in November last year.

It was repotted in early march and seemed happy.

It never didn't have flowers.

One day it looked wilted a bit, within a week completely shriveled and dead.

It was watered regularly, but not too much and was shaded from direct sun for much of the day in a sheltered location.

It was a very large established plant. 

It was gifted to me and the price info was left on. It came from one of the best nurseries in my area and cost €35!

To the best of my knowledge they don't die back like this.

Should I removed the dead foliage and hope it comes back when the season cools?

Space is at a premium in my garden. If it's unlikely to come back there's a waiting list for its spot...

PTSD,"So I thought she was blowing it out of proportion.

For about six months now she has been saying it is ruining her life, causing anxiety etc.

But having spent some time in her house recently it is so much worse then I thought.

While I was there, for seven hours solid, this dog cried, whined and howled loudly along with scratching.

Inside her insulated house, with double glazing, all windows and doors shut, it was too constant, distracting and loud to hold a conversation for any length of time.

From what I can discern myself and what she has told me the dog belongs to the neighbours son. He does not live there.

When he is in work and no one would be at home he leaves the dog with his parents from 7am till after 6pm.

The dog is locked in a small shed at the end of their garden and left there, alone, till he returns.

I am assuming it being left there is due to complaints from his own neighbours.

She has tried speaking to him about it, but he was rude and dismissive. She said did he know the dog cried constantly when he left. He said what did she expect him to do about it and walked off.


It is causing further tensions in what can only be described as a difficult relationship with these neighbours.

She did report it to the dspca about two months ago, anonymously, although I'd say they knew well it was her.

She is not sure where that led, but it appeared to stop for a couple of weeks.

We have always had dogs in the area. We're used to it, a man in the road behind us used to breed dogs and the puppies were constantly yapping.

It's the distress in the noise, the volume and the knowledge when it starts that it will continue constantly for hours.

My mam has suffered from mental health problems since before I was born.

She has been in and out of hospitals.

I *know* this is the kind of ongoing stress that will make her go off the deep end soon.

It we call the dspca again it will probably just stop for a short period.

The next time I am there while it's occurring I will record an hour of it.

I don't really know what to do.

Her friend and sometimes boyfriend also suffers from mental health problems and is threatening to poison the dog, punch the owner all sorts of stuff.

The local council had arrived and mowed over it all unexpectedly.

Since then they have come back six times.

I had backup plants already started that I kept replacing the damaged ones with.

After a lot of work I planted within two inches of the adjoining wall along the bed I had made.

This meant I had to water the area while the plants were young, but they were all doing well and although some got a bit smooshed when Mr. *I drive a  ride on lawn mower and hate plants* arrived, they were surviving.

Any way.

Yesterday he arrived again and I ignored it.

Then I heard a new weird sound.

This MF had a weed whacker thing and was going along the wall ripping up everything.

So good bye calendula, nasturtiums, chives, crocosmia, forget me nots, curry plant, welsh poppies and columbine.

It's honestly hard not to feel like he had some sort of vendetta.

He has mowed that one area so often during an extended dry spell that the *grass* along the verge is just yellow scruff. The other land he sometimes mowed is not as damaged.

He knew I had permission from the council.

I got f*cking letters to try and stop him.

I've been playing so long now that survival isn't really an issue any more.

As for exploration that's just the same thing again and again.

I am glad I understand myself more. I've done a lot of schema work in the last few years and I do know that most of my beliefs centre around being vulnerable, having to be self reliant and distrustful of pretty much everything.

I have one area in particular that I mind. Earlier this year I decided to get in touch with my areas tidy towns to adopt the patch. Most of my neighbours are very nice and supportive of my gardening and beautification efforts, but a few are cranks, so having the scrap of paper to make them stop nagging and giving dirty looks was great.


So, from December I gave the whole patch a clean up, cleared debris (people dump garden waste and kitty litter there) and started amending the soil a bit.

It's a small wall and railings running the length of my road with a GAA pitch behind it. 

I had already planted forget me nots, columbine, lupins and welsh poppies sparsely in the same area.

I planted more this spring, from seedlings I'd cultivated over winter.

I also divided chives up into plugs and planted them the length of the wall at four foot intervals.

I planted climbing nasturtiums (about 40!) The length of it as well and planted calendula.

I do have more plants on the go, as usual, to go out and about the place.

**BUT** today I opened my front door because something was very loud and was instantly hit with a strong onion/garlic smell.

The local council had sent some one around in a ride on mower to cut it down!

I'm really really bad at confrontation. So I met stood there for a while trying to work out what to do as he carried on mowing down everything.

The wall I'm talking about is 20+ houses long, he was only the length of 3 when I first spotted him.

So I went and got my little confirmation email and any out to talk to him.

He said he needed to cut the grass along the verge, I pointed out that another local does that, and only mowed it three days ago.

He says it's the local authoritys land and he's been paid to mow it. 

Now I *knew* they did this, but the patch is about six foot wide and two foot against the wall is bare soil, or was before I planted in it.

I said this to him.

Didn't care.

Showed him the letter from the tidy towns committee.

Didn't care.


I know the chives will come back, but they were coming into flower.

Many perennials were lost, I don't think they were established enough to deal with getting cut back to 1cm.

On the plus side the calendula are still little seedlings so they were too small to get the chop and the nasturtiums were too close to the wall for him to reach.

I personally think he was just being cantankerous, I've lived here almost four years and never seen any of the guys that maintain that area go in close to the wall like that. They also normally only mow that patch in September and leave it like a jungle. He had just finished doing the pitches.

Maybe he thought he was being helpful?


The lady I mentioned that mows that area also suffered at his hands.

Last year she planted hundreds of spring bulbs into another near by patch of grass she minds at the end of our road. She's been painstakingly mowing around them. 

The narcissus had just gone out of flower, but lovely little red tulips had come up everywhere in the last week or so.

All mowed. 

Now her flowers were **very** visible. He couldn't have missed them.

My chives sorta looked like grass, fair enough.

I have yet to notice much damage, but often find their pupae with larva inside on wool blankets and empty pupae on the carpets. Every now and then we suddenly notice loads of the clumsy plain adults fluttering around. 

It was the adult moths we noticed first and being uncertain as to what type of house moth they were went through every cupboard and bag of food we had, scrubbed all the presses, looked and washed behind the fridge and oven to clear away any food waste that had collected. There was no evidence of insect damage or activity at all, but we continue to keep those areas clean and all dry goods in sealed jars now.

I then shook out all blankets out doors and aired them all in the back garden, cleaned the inside of all the wardrobes of dust and aired out coats that were rarely used etc. 

We vacuum regularly, maybe every ten days at least. 

It was about six months of keeping an eye out before I found pupae and was more certain of what we had.

We have not been over run, but it is much harder to manage in winter as in Ireland it basically never stops raining for four months a year and airing things out is a struggle as is washing and drying bedding (we have no dryer) 

I still wash the inside of clothing storage areas every month or so and tidy them out.

I feel like moth repellents don't do much, I'm not sure.

Is it feasible to keep managing the problem myself? As I said I've basically seen no damage anywhere and I rarely come across mass evidence of them any more, just the odd piece here and there.

 I am currently in hospital again, they don't mind me not being medicated due to my past experiences and their under standing that my depression is more reactive than chemical. I am afraid however that going on meds now will lead me to never being off them and as it is with my condition I already have problems with it effecting my cognitive and physical state and I like being able to tell what and why that has happened,I feel adding meds would make me less aware of how I was actually reacting to emotional upset and stimulus.


They have tried before and my doctors have reliably told me that there were no suitable medications, but now my doctor is saying she read a paper on this one that suggests it has off label usage in the treatment of ptsd. She even admitted that it only helped in 17% of cases and that she has never prescribed it before and doesn't know what to expect.

So now I'm just really confused. I wish I could just stick with PRNs or that my brain would stop doing this to me. I had a horrifically retraumitising  event take place two months ago after being at a stage for over three years where my symptoms were 95% manageable much of the time, I still experienced hyperarousal etc near constantly but didn't let it effect behaviours any more for example or I rarely had incapacitating flashbacks.


I'm currently in hospital for damage control.

But people don't even understand that because they understand the illness so little.


I wasn't in a war zone.


I wasn't in a heist or kidnapped

Or any of the things that people commonly expect.

So even if they know what it is they don't understand.

I have been diagnosed by two separate psychiatrists. Occupational therapists. Psychologists.

I know it's what I'm suffering from.

I think sometimes that because I wasn't involved in some stenciled idea of what might cause it people don't believe me. That they are less willing to accept it. 

If it was one of those things I could just say *I served in X.* or *I was in a car crash that almost killed me* 

But instead I don't want to answer because I was abused severely by the people who were supposed to love me the most for years and years. 

It feels like exposing something very personal about yourself. 

It's also not the answer people expect and they rarely react well.

I guess in many ways I **was** in a war zone. My home was dangerous you never knew when you would get hurt, how or why.

And in some ways i was kidnapped and held prisoner. I was a child. There was no escape, there was no help and there was no end in sight. My entire world was fear and pain and humiliation.

If you served in combat, or were in a war zone and what you lived through hurt you so much you developed ptsd I imagine (because I can't claim to know) that this ""stencil"" of experience can save you from having to explain something more painful and personal but I also imagine people rarely see beyond it to the reality of your experiences or even want to. So stencil answers becomes all you get to express at times. And it's not enough of an explanation for people to understand you or your needs.

I think that's the same as non combat based ptsd. They don't want to know the human element or hear of the reality of the suffering. They don't want to see the pain. And you're not sure you want them to see it either because it exposes something. 

But I suppose it would be nice in both situations to have the option to talk and to be understood.

I always saw this massive divide between ptsd from service and not from service. But I don't think they're that different and I think we do everyone who has developed a disservice when we make that divide.

Lives are different, humans and their experiences are individual but pain is pain. 

I still just wish people saw beyond what they expect. That they understood even a little. Because in our attempts to get better and live happy lives we are all fucking amazing and they should know that. It would spawn more empathy and make recovery easier rather than more of a challenge.",BallPointPariah
PTSD,"My annuals are beginning to die back. Don't worry! I've already bought even more seeds for next year. 

My personal favourites are...
___________________
**Night scented stock.**
Looks a little sad during the day, but once evening comes they wake up and the smell is amazing. Better then anything I've ever grown and very intense. I guarantee your neighbours will comment on it. They're also very easy to grow. I start them indoors in Feb then stagger plant them once a month outdoors. You just need to sprinkle them down. Nothing fancy. I started growing them as a child about twenty three years ago. My first attempt was because my mam was sad after my dad died and said she loved them. So I grew them to cheer her up. I've grown them every year since.
_________________
**Sweetpea**
Each year I face the summer with an army of sweet pea. They smell amazing, bees love them and they're very pretty. I often use them as cut flowers around the house and they last about five days in a vase. I never plant single coloured varieties and love the anticipation of not knowing what each one will be like. They can be a bit fussy to grow sometimes. They in my experience, need a lot of minding early on to get them going. They always seem tiny and like they'll never amount to anything and then it seems over night they're flying up a foot a day. 
I first plant them indoors in January and then again in Feb and march. I stagger the planting, not so they'll last longer, but because they're *so* delicate at first I'm bound to lose some. Frost gets a lot. But if they survive early on its worth it as that extra growing time under harsher conditions makes them tough in the long run. I still have some in flower now that have been in bloom since may.
I first started growing them when I was about 11, so 20 years ago. Haven't missed a year since. I saw illustrations of them in an old book and thought ""I can do that"" and so it began. 
______________________
**Nasturtiums**
Nasturtiums, in the wise words of friends are my *lobster*

I grow them everywhere. They grow themselves everywhere is another way of looking at it. 
They are a favourite for as long as I can remember caring about gardening. There's stumpy little ones that are like little bonsai alien trees and giant trailing ones that wind their way all over my garden into a beautiful art nouveau tangle. I turn them into pesto, I eat the petals. The bees go bloody nuts for them and there's still loads clambering around my garden now. I love their resilience, I love that the worse things seem for them the better they do. My first memory of them is the old lady who lived next door to my baby sitter growing them all over the place. She was grumpy and have out a lot but loved her garden. I didn't know what they were, but I loved how they looked, how they smelled that their seeds were so big. She told me I could collect seeds from them after I kept hopping the wall into her garden to look at them and told me how to plant them. I grew them by the hundred from the age of seven. 
_______________
**Columbine**
While not exactly an annual they'll get an honourable mention. I love that they cross pollinate so easily and if encouraged you can get a lovely gradient of colours over the years. The plants I still have now are from seeds going back decades belong to my granny. My grandad brought them home for her back in the 50s from Kerry and she grew them every year and gave them to all the neighbours. When I walk around the area she lived and see them all over the place I like to imagine she had a hand in it and when I see mine each year I know that somewhere despite all the years of cross pollination there's still a bit of the original ones my grandad found in Kerry growing wild and thought she'd like.
___________

There have been other annuals over the years and I have to say goodbye to them every winter having growth them carefully and lovingly from seed but the ones above will always be my favourites.

I save their seed each autumn and they live on again another summer. Sometimes in another house as I move a lot. I like to imagine all the volunteer seedlings I've left in my wake are still continuing on somewhere.

I've gotten black eyed susan vine for next year which I haven't grown in several years. A new variety of peony poppy I haven't ever grown and debilis sunflowers for the first time too.

I've been asked by my employer to learn Wordpress and how to move a website over to Wordpress from another platform. Before I learn Wordpress, I was wondering what knowledge and skills are important to have. I've heard from some people it's good to know HTML5, CSS3, Java, and PHP. I've heard from others that ""HTML isn't really needed, just learn CSS3,"" and every other combination under the sun of what I should know or don't need to know going into learning Wordpress.  In short, What should I know *before* using Wordpress. Right now I'm a graphic designer/video editor and have only minimal knowledge of HTML and (barely) CSS.

PTSD,"    TL;DR One way to improve upon beta search would be the addition of identifying categories/tags, editable by the mods from subreddit settings.

For example, if you were to search the term ""[music](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=music&sort=relevance&t=all)"" a wealth of posts would come up but only three subreddits. On first thought, one may think that this is because music is in their name/description. But then at second thought, one realizes ""wait, this is Reddit, there are many subs with music in the name/description."" 

In order not to exclude subreddits such as /r/progrockmusic, /r/ambientmusic, /r/spacemusic, or subs without music in the title such as /r/drones, /r/listentothis, or even /r/woahtunes, categories/tags should be implemented.

In theory, every subreddit would belong to a category and then be able to have up to x amount of tags. These categories/tags would then be added to the list of quantifiers used in search. Granted, if one wanted ambient music or its related genres there would be a greater success rate searching ""[ambient music](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=ambient+music&sort=relevance&t=all) instead of ""[music](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=music&sort=relevance&t=all),"" but only marginally better. Only three subs would show and not the many other related subs such as /r/minimal, /r/minimalism_music, /r/ambient, etc.

In practice, the mods of each sub would be able to click ""subreddit settings"" under ""Moderation Tools"" on the sidebar and have a box to type in tags, and a box to either type in a custom category or pick from a list of premade categories. I think that the addition of categories/tags would greatly refine beta search, and open up subreddit search results to more than three subs.

Note: Maybe this has already been suggested/considered- I don't know. I post based solely upon my own thoughts and observations.

I'm wary of alienating someone with a ""Trauma - Other"" tag, though that could be me being overly cautious, as there can be value in creating a more recognizable way to see the more ""common"" traumas.

PTSD,"**Problems and solutions:**

-Anxiety, adhd and depression: All three combined create mental states which make productive and focused activity of the sort that might improve the current lifestyle situation extremely difficult. **However, it should be possible to fix these issues, because it was not always this way.**

-Solving the current situation will probably lead to an improvement in your mental state. Similarly, solving your mental state will quickly lead to an improvement in your current situation, as your capacity to manipulate events returns to its former level. The trouble is that the two are acting in a synergistic manner to amplify each other - poor mental state worsens life situation, life situation worsens mental state.

-People who care about you a lot, who are deeply involved in your life, can't help you because the sympathetic pain that getting into these issues causes actually worsens the issue. By putting mental loads on people you care about, you actually worsen the situation. This goes double if your relationships with said people are actually part of the problem. 

-People who don't actually care about you that much can't help you, because eventually you'll put them off with your emotional burdens. They also won't really understand the enormity of what you're dealing with, because they have no corresponding life experience which matches it. Anons never run out of energy because there are always more anons, but they are unlikely to provide no meaningful insight - mostly you are talking to yourself. Besides, time wasted on the internet is itself is part of the problem.

-People who are payed to help you are eventually going to want to take your money, which often also worsens the problem. Not to mention, acknowledging that you have a problem causes the people who care about you or depend on you to freak out or feel guilty about the fact that you have a problem, which really only worsens the problem, not to mention the enormous time sink involved in setting that up.

-Due to the above, there are really no other humans that you can trust to behave in the manner that you need them to behave towards you at this point in time. **This is something you primarily have to fix alone.**

-Medication: Require focused foresight, research, and planning to acquire and use effectively, suffers from the same problems as therapy, and half the time don't even work and have side effects which themselves are a source of issues. The ADHD meds which have been effective in the past are now worsening anxiety and exacerbate the adrenal fatigue from the high-stress lifestyle.

-Exercise: While my speed and strength is improving, mental benefits have been less dramatic than anticipated. Exercise has actually become a source of procrastination. Anti-depressant effects of exercise are noticeable - however, attempts to use exercise as a focus-and-productivity treatment cause physical exhaustion because the mental boost effect does not last longer than 20 minutes. Exercise is therefore not the sole answer. On the positive side, I've at least acquired a consistent exercise habit, which is good for other reasons.

-Socializing: Causes the greatest improvement in mental symptoms by far, but due to aforementioned lifestyle factors the process of setting things up is very difficult, time consuming,and unpredictable. Once social activity has ceased, mental state returns to baseline after ~12 hours, or even immediately if exposed to any acute stresses. Increasing social interaction seems like a worthwhile end goal, but not a sustainable first step to get out of the current situation. 

-Meditation: Provides immediate reductions in all three mental symptoms, but, once again, the effect is very short lasting. **Consider meditating more often, perhaps every 2 hours.** Beware of turning it into a form of procrastination, like exercise. Bypasses the exhaustion issue. There may be diminishing returns on meditation sessions.

-Asking people to hold you accountable to getting work done and setting artificial deadlines has worked in the past. It isn't working now, due to increases in anxiety. **Consider pairing ""accountability"" strategy with an anxiolytic.**

-Pomedoro technique has been somewhat effective in mitigating adhd issues. However, starting requires enormous amounts of willpower and the process of starting creates anxiety. **Make habit of doing pomedoros at noon, 4, and 8 every day, creating a habit may reduce activation barrier.**.

The only way I've found of making this less frustrating is just accepting that 80% of humanity has a sub-clinical mental illness of some sort, and it's not their fault and they can't help but act that way. OK, I admit, I've got my own little mini-deficits, but why does everyone else have to be broken in ways that make them *miserable*? I don't blame them, but *why does it have to be that way*??",rrrant

To sum up yesterday, it was nearly perfect. Pretty much smiled from the time I woke up until I fell asleep.
This morning, I woke up feeling weird. My body was exhausted as if I had spent the whole night stressing every muscle in my body. About an hour later, the anxiety started setting in. I talked with my mom on the phone for about an hour, watched The Office, made lunch... My anxiety was under control. Fast forward about three hours and my anxiety was through the roof. I called my mom, no answer. The second she calls me back I'm in attack mode. I hung up on her after yelling for a few minutes. It took a matter or 10 seconds for me to burst into tears. My mom has been my rock for like past 6 months; I can call her at 2, 3 and 4 a.m. and she will answer, and is always patient and sympathetic. For no reason at all, I took all of my feelings out on her. Now, 4 hours later, I'm ashamed and afraid to call her and apologize. I'm about to snap.

Two weeks ago I had a 5 year old tumor removed. It was hidden until they did a laparoscopy expecting that I had endometriosis. Instead of finding scar tissue and cysts, they found the tumor. I left for college that week so I didn't have a follow-up appointment to ask questions. They expect the tumor started to develop when I was fourteen. I'm the youngest patient they've had with a fibroid tumor.

That was the night I learned that I am not the only one. And when I found out that my brother had been feeling the same pain that I was experiencing, I fell apart. After months of agonizing body memories and flashbacks, a plethora of sleepless nights and recurring, horrifyingly realistic nightmares; the news hit me like a ton of bricks. My jaw dropped, my vision blurred and my heart fell 4 feet into the soles of my shoes. Knowing that one of the strongest men in my life was struggling with the same pain I lived with constantly was easily enough to push me to end everything.

Has anybody ever truthfully answered this question? In my personal experience it is easier to just give a quick reply such as “I’m fine”, rather than to list off every thought that was running through my head at 3:00 A.M… And 4:00 A.M…. And 5:00 A.M… And 6:00 A.M… And at 7:00 A.M. on my drive to school as I rehearse my good mornings with a fake smile and my excuses for not eating lunch, yet again.
1st period: No response
I keep my eyes locked on my worksheets and pretend like my mind isn’t completely preoccupied with other things. I figure you’ve gone back to bed after dropping my little brother off at school. When the bell finally rings I silently rejoice about making it through another class without drawing attention to my awkward nervousness.
2nd period: No response
I’m in my comfort zone. 133 is one of the only places in the school that I can relax and no have to worry about people staring. Although the 10+ underclassmen are obnoxious, ignorant little shits, I don’t have to worry about socializing with anybody other than my favorite teacher and a senior in drama. I check my phone as often as I can but try not to let myself worry too much. “I’m sure she’s fine. She’s my mom, of course she’s okay.”
3rd period: No response
I look nervously around the room at the people I’ve spent the last three years with. It’s 9:30 A.M. on a Monday and half of them are still too hung-over from the three beers they had on Saturday night to notice my hands nervously shaking as I reach for my phone, inbox: 0.
4th period: No response
I’m praying that you’ll text me back. Who am I supposed to call at lunch? I’m not prepared to talk to other people. They’ll notice something is wrong. Please mom, I’m scared.
Lunch: No response
Should I call? Am I freaking out for no reason? Yup… Freaking out for no reason. But I wish you would at least respond.
6th period: No response
I’m surrounded by some of the loudest people in the school. As much as I dislike half of the people surrounding me, it’s hard not to laugh at the playful bickering going on between the teacher and some of my outspoken peers. Although I have an awful feeling in the pit of my stomach, I am able to keep my mind from wandering too far off. I still have not heard from you but by this point I have come up with at least twenty reasons as to why I haven’t heard from you… And in all of the scenarios you were safe: you had gone out to lunch, you weren’t feeling well, you were out with your best friend, you were cleaning, you had an appointment…
7th period: No response
I am itching to be done for the day and go to the art room to talk to my favorite teacher. I check my phone a few times and although I have a sinking feeling in the back of my mind, I manage to get my work done and talk to a few of my classmates. I think about texting you a minute before the bell rings, but the tone sounds and I get distracted and put my phone back into my bag.
8th period: No response
The favorite part of my day is my free period. 90% of my time is spent talking to the art teacher, joking around and bitching about things that happened earlier that day. I have my phone in my hand the whole time but it never goes off. I don’t think too much about it.

I messaged the only person I could bare to talk to.

She said you were scary. I couldn't understand why people thought you were so bad. You were just my mom. The love you gave me was all I knew. I thought everybody else had it the same way. I met my best friend Jennifer in preschool. You and dad always let me go over to her house thinking I just loved spending time with Jennifer. It wasn't just Jennifer. Her mom was the best. She made cookies almost everyday. She did crafts with us. She read us stories. She helped us with homework. And she told Jennifer that she loved her. And I know I should've been happy that my friend had such a loving mother and that I got to spend time with her too. But I wasn't. It made me hostile. And the more time I spent at their house, the more I realized that you weren't like all of the other moms. Why couldn't you even tell me that you loved me? Why wouldn't you let me sleep with you when I was scared at night? Why wouldn't you ever hug or kiss me? I used to hide in my room with a picture of you and cry. And I'm not entirely sure why I cried. It might've been because I was sad that you were always at work. It might've been because I wanted affection that in the back of my mind I knew I would never get. I tried calling you at work. You said not to bother you unless somebody was bleeding or dying. It's not like I asked for much mom. I just wanted to hear you say that you loved me. I know I started growing distant at a fairly young age but what did you expect mom. In sixth grade you asked me why I thought it was okay to look like a boy. In seventh grade you beat me multiple times. In eighth grade the emotional abuse reached a whole new level and you told me my wrists made me look emo. Freshman year you found out that I was cutting and I had lied about all of my scars. At first you didn't believe me. Then you asked me why I was so desperate for attention. 
And the words that came out of your mouth the week before homecoming will be engraved in my mind until the day that I die. ""I'm so ashamed. I don't even want you going to homecoming. What if people see your scars? What do you think they're going to say about dad and me?""

Maybe you should've fucking thought about that before you called me worthless, a wretched bitch, a pain in the ass, the problem child.

Junior year I met a classmate in a parking lot. We decided to just carpool to a friends house since it was far away. He got into my car, grabbed my wrists and forced my hands up and down him until he came all over my hands, wrists and jacket, then he forced his hands down my shirt. I was crying. I kept repeating that I wanted him to stop. I kept yelling no. I begged him to not make me have sex with him. When I finally told you about that night you told me I must've done something to indicate to him that I wanted to do it. You asked me what I was wearing. Two years later I came out to you. I told you that I'm a lesbian. And you cried and told me that you loved me and all you ever wanted was for me to be happy. While you were acting like a loving parent who had shown me nothing but acceptance and support throughout my whole life, I asked you if you still thought I wanted Nick to do what he did. And you denied ever acting like you did.

To this day you deny beating me, emotionally abusing me and neglecting your youngest daughter. I was always somebody else's problem.

I love you but I'll never be your little girl. I'll never see in you what I saw in Jodi. I'm giving up on you mom. You've hurt me more than you'll ever care to understand.

So next time you want to say to me that you just don't understand what you did wrong, read this. I appreciate the financial support. You give me more than most parents.

I don't remember much more than that but when I look back I can't help but think that this wasn't an isolated incident. Somebody was there with you.

Yes, the symbolism is over-the-top and on-the-nose. Yes, the design is cheesy. Yes, Roddy Piper's acting leaves something to be desired. But you know what? I don't care. John Carpenter knows how to entertain, and he delivers with *They Live.*

*They Live* is one of those great films that you can't imagine would be produced today. It's dark and paranoid and isn't afraid to accuse the US government of truly evil actions. And yet, it's also hopeful. Not in a patriotic way, but in a distinctly individualist, ""we must defend ourselves against our country"" kind of way. It's far more political than the sort of action/horror movies that are made today, over 25 years later, so it is refreshing to see these issues approached in this particular way. 

Even more refreshing is that *They Live* doesn't attack a particular ideology as much as it attacks a system. You can see how the film could be embraced by Occupy Wall Street activists and Tea Party members, because it doesn't conform to party lines. Instead, it's interested in critiquing a system that impacts us all, one that should mobilize us all to fight back. *They Live* really is a surprisingly optimistic, unifying film in this sense.

Beyond the politics, *They Live* is just a damn good action film. The story is well-paced and structured, and the stakes are constantly increasing, so there's never a dull moment. The action sequences are bombastic and silly, but they entertain. Overall, the film delivers. It's now alongside *Die Hard* and *The Terminator* on my list of feel-good '80s action entertainment. I'll be watching it again.

The franchise continues to be brilliantly cast; the regulars are as strong as ever, and Peter Dinklage added some fresh energy. And while it easily could have been clunky, the time-travel narrative in *Days of Future Past* worked well. Not all of the historic landmarks felt necessary (did we need that one scene to be set at the Paris Peace Accords?), but they certainly didn't feel out-of-place, and the integration of Jackman's Wolverine and McAvoy's Professor X/Fassbender's Magneto felt seamless.

Still, it felt like Bryan Singer was easing his way back into a universe of which he hasn't been a part for over a decade. Compared to the near-perfection of *X-Men* and *X-2*, *Days of Future Past* came across as one script revision shy of being totally production-ready. The dialogue between Stewart and McKellan sounded particularly stilted, which is a disappointment compared to their usual chemistry. I don't think anything was necessarily missing from *Days of Future Past* -- it just felt like the training wheels were back on, and I'm looking forward to seeing Singer's strong footing return in *X-Men: Apocalypse*. 

I had a great time watching *Days of Future Past*, and I'm sure I'll watch it again. If I were to spend the money to see a blockbuster for a second time this year, though, I'd spend it on *Captain America: Winter Soldier*.

**Rating:** 7/10

I'm still trying to decide if this movie is entertainingly terrible or just plain terrible. I think it's the latter, but as much as I didn't like it, I still felt compelled to watch the entire film, and I still wanted to know how it was going to end, so there must've been **something** compelling deep down in it.

I am not going to recap the plot, because it's utterly nonsensical, so I'll just say this: *Passion* is a film that uses sexuality and eroticism to underscore power-play relationships between women. This is not a new concept, and it's one that has been executed quite well by other films in the past (looking at you, *Showgirls*). But it doesn't work in this film, because the sexuality feels completely empty and unrealistic. I realize that, to a point, this is the intended effect. The film uses homoeroticism (lesbian attraction, specifically) and kink (particularly BDSM and voyeurism) as tools for asserting social dominance, rather than for actual sexual pleasure, so some degree of emptiness is to be expected. But none of those devices ultimately have anything to say, making their inclusion feel meaningless and intended solely for titillation and marketing potential.

Early in the film, Christine (Rachel McAdams) asks Isabelle (Noomi Rapace) what she ""wants."" (Yes, it's that vague; yes, the dialogue is that awful all the way through.) We never really find out what Isabelle wants, and perhaps that's the biggest problem. Does she want authentic sexual intimacy with a woman? We have no idea. The audience sees the sexual tension between Christine, Isabelle, and Dani (Karoline Herfurth), because we are told that such tension exists. The only slightly believable homoerotic attraction is on the part of Dani, but this is introduced so late in the film that it's hard to take seriously at all. 

This isn't to say that every film needs to explicitly declare the sexual orientations of its characters -- I'll point again to *Showgirls* as the perfect example of a film whose sexually ambiguous female leads have palpable, believable sexual tension that is obvious even if never explicitly stated. But (and this is something I never thought I'd find myself saying) Brian De Palma just doesn't handle subtlety as well as Paul Verhoeven does. Sure, Verhoeven's movies are bombastic, but when a careful viewer notices what's **not** explicitly said in his films, the craft becomes a lot more clear. De Palma doesn't do this. If he does, he's not doing it here. He's telling us to look for subtext, but when we do, we find nothing. If he's unable to craft such subtext in a way that adds to the viewing experience, the least he could do is set up his intentions a bit more explicitly in the text itself.

The film's structure is also a complete mess. Some sections drag on for seemingly no reason, while some crucial events happen so quickly that there's hardly any time to process them in the moment. I'd say that there's a twist ending, but the whole story makes so little sense that I'm not sure what the ending itself actually ""twists"". As my husband pointed out during the film, you have to wonder how the film read on paper that convinced a studio to greenlight it and otherwise talented actors like McAdams and Rapace to participate in it. I've read that *Passion* is the remake of the French film [*Love Crime*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1459012/), so I'd be curious to watch the original and see how they compare. I'm not sure I feel like spending anymore time with these characters, though.

I'm not sure what else to say, really. I'm not disappointed that I sat through it. I just wish that I lived in a world where the ""Rachel McAdams/Noomi Rapace erotic thriller"" was actually watchable.

**Rating:** 2/10

5/18/2014

Saw this earlier tonight at a repertory screening on a beautiful 35mm print. Now that I've seen this film, I'm shocked that it took me so long to get around to it. It's a true classic of political satire, and even though it's now 50 years old, the story is still as relevant as ever. 

Though Peter Sellers is the center and driving force of the film, I found myself most drawn to George C. Scott's performance as Turgidson. I'm mostly familiar with Scott's performance in *Patton*, which came several years after *Dr. Strangelove* but exists as a clear (if completely unintentional) parallel to this earlier performance. Turgidson feels like a parody of Patton at points, gleefully embracing the destruction of war and excitedly sharing his over-the-top patriotism with all who will listen. Scott shines at every moment he's on screen in *Dr. Strangelove*, and I already look forward to future rewatchings, just to see him in his element again.

The weakest element of *Dr. Strangelove* might be its structure. The film is comprised of three intersecting subplots, and while each story and group of characters is necessary for progressing the overall narrative, there are moments in which the film is weighed down by one of the subplots, stifling the flow of the action. Specifically, I felt as though the Ripper/Mandrake story, which is absolutely integral to the narrative, didn't receive its due screen time. Or, if it did, it felt bogged down by the sequences in the bomber and in the war room, mitigating the gravity that those scenes need to convey. This isn't to say that the narrative completely suffers or falls apart -- it doesn't at all. But I wonder how much stronger the film could be had the structure felt more thought-out and intentional.

I'm keeping this review short, largely because I have a feeling this film is one that's best appreciated after considerable thought and analysis. My gut responses are all positive, but I expect that my fullest appreciation for the film won't emerge until I have the opportunity to discuss it with friends and read commentary and criticism about it. With that in mind, I'm keeping my rating of it lower than it probably deserves, with the understanding that, in time, I will be able to give it a higher, more carefully considered rating. For now, though, I want to take some time to think it through and appreciate the viewing experience for what it was.

Rating: 7.5/10

Mainly I hate the tunnel you have to walk through to get to the plane and then just being 'trapped' with nowhere to go really. Tomorrow I am booked to go to Mexico with my boyfriend and his family (who I love) and I am really so bummed that I may not be able to go. Obviously I love the beach and I love their company and I used to travel a lot, but I feel like my anxiety has changed that a bit...

Any suggestions? I've been on sertraline for nearly a week now and I feel some benefits but I'm still unsure. Will also speak to my counsellor about this.

I want to organise events, potentially hosting an inspiring guest speaker. Or simply a group discussion, where the attendees can talk freely and feel supported in doing so. I want to potentially organise some counselling. I want to host writing or art workshops to spark their creativity, or cooking classes or career events. I want to organise fun barbecues and lunches. These events would be charged at affordable prices to cover the cost of staff and venue, equipment etc. I could organise small volunteering projects in the area where the community could attend and help out, to feel productive and good about themselves. Moreover, I would be selling merchandise of which the proceeds would go back into funding projects etc. Essentially, I want to make them feel special and loved because they are. YOU are.

This is a very rough idea and since the people in this subreddit - yes, you - would be the one benefitting from this enterprise, any and all feedback/advice proves invaluable. Market research, if you will.

PTSD,"Please excuse my ignorance, and I may not be using the right terms. I am not even sure how to phrase my question, so here is a link to a picture, if that helps. Basically, I would prefer the simplest and easiest solution (if possible?).   :-)

If you prefer words to a picture: I have a 2008 Macbook Pro running OSX hooked up with a blue ethernet cable to my Netgear C3700 router (that also does wifi...it is called a ""Dual Band Wireless Cable Gateway)...and the router gets internet from a black Comcast cable that comes into the house from outside. Unfortunately, the place where I use my wifi iPad is on the other side of the house and gets crappy wifi reception, but the good news is that there is a second section of black Comcast cable in that end of the house. Without removing or moving my router, can I just add a plug-and-play wifi device near my iPad (I hope to attach the device to the second section of black Comcast cable that goes near my iPad)?

PTSD,"Perhaps these are dumb questions, but: 

1. Is ""profit margin"" the best metric to determine if the high prices in Whole Foods are because of higher salaries and higher quality items, or because price-gouging and making huge profits?

2. If profit margin is the best metric to use, then I would like to ask: If Whole Foods has a profit margin of 4% and most grocery stores have a profit margin of 2%, does that mean that if one buys identical items at both stores, then will the Whole Foods items (on average) will cost only 2% more?

PTSD,"This is something I have wondered about for years: Back in my college days, car insurance was super-expensive because I was a young man, but oddly, motorcycle insurance was super-cheap (like, $60 per year, which is crazy, especially because I legally rode without a helmet). I realize that most motorcycle accidents are the ""other guy's"" fault (and so the insurance of the car driver would pay for a crash), but what would have happened if I:
-Ran into a tree or off a cliff.
-Got hit by a car and the car took off (hit-and-run).
-I ran into the back of someone's car because I was looking at a pretty girl.

PTSD,"This is an odd question, but it's asking what kind of hockey swag you would like (for free) to receive from a charity, and what experience is fun, easy, and meaningful at a live hockey game. This is all for charity. Situation: You arrive at a live game, perhaps with your family, and when entering the arena, some volunteers are giving away free silicone bracelets (like the Lance Armstrong bracelets) with the team logo on it! If you grab a free bracelet-band, its packaging says that this gift is brought to you by the team's charity of the month (a dog-rescue that rescues dogs and trains them as service dogs). 

May I ask you the following? Do you have any strong (or mild) opinions on:

- Would you like a bracelet to just reads ""Team Name"", or would it really have to have the 4-color logo on it, for you to appreciate the gift? (Note that it might be hard to make out a small logo on a bracelet?)

- Would you prefer a silicone bracelet for your wrist or a silicone ring for your finger? Which would be more fun?

- If the bracelet had additional text on it, besides the team name, would you still like it? Or maybe even like it better? Some ideas might be the following (or maybe you have a better idea?):

* ""Team Name"" (heart sign) Dogs

* ""Team Name"" then the charity logo (heart with a paw in it)

* ""Team Logo"" alternating with the charity logo (heart with paw in it)

* We Woof for the  ""Team name that starts with W""

Or something else? Is any of the above fun and enticing?

If you are NOT a big fan of dogs, but love hockey, would you still want the gift in some form?

-Want to answer another (logistical) question? If the packaging talked about the purpose of the charity (it's dog-related but no hockey-related), and it said you could make a $10 donation by texting RESCUE to a five-digit number, would you consider doing so at the live hockey game? Or is that dumb?

Until ten years ago, Isla Holbox was just this little fishing village of 1200 people, but they've built some small hotels now, and many of the locals have converted their homes into shops or small restaurants. No chain restaurants or hotels, and most vacationers are European or Mexican (which is fun for this American, to meet other people than Americans). It's like Isla Mujeres was 25 years ago, I'm told. Taco stands are $1/taco, restaurants are about $10 (either Mexican, or there are some expatriate Italians who have Italian restaurants there).

PTSD,"What do you think ? Do you think it's necessary for us to call it a disorder ? Can we just call it post traumatic stress ? I want to be clear that it should be acknowledged that it does hurt, it does cause us exquisite pain and it does impair our functioning. We are in a state where we are under a lot of stress so the ""stress"" part should be kept. My issue is where is the stress coming from, is it society which allows various traumas and which should be doing more to prevent them or should the cause be attributed to sufferer's biology/genetics ?

People who are grieving a death seem to get some sympathy from society, and things like bereavement leave and other special allowances even though their grief is not considered a disorder. People expect them to be under a lot of stress, accept that they won't be functioning at their normal level (or even at all) and not themselves and people expect them to take a while to recover, however the stress they are under is generally considered normal and a normal reaction. ",traumasucks
PTSD,"Does anyone else get this ? People/friends/acquaintances/family members assuming that they would have had more strength or would have acted differently when surviving our trauma ? In extreme situations they may judge us as lazy or spoilt (ouch!).

It hurts having to deal with this perspective in people. And the denial of our strength/courage takes a toll on me. It feels like struggling hard to swim against the tide and then having someone stand there meanwhile you are struggling, discouragingly telling you that it's not really that hard as you say it is. I don't think that most people mean to do it consciously.

I'm beginning to consider that I may need to limit contact with these sorts of people for my own mental health. The subtle disrespect is very draining. And quite frankly I think these people are seriously out of touch with reality, a little out of their minds and their craziness is contagious. I need to acknowledge my strength, courage and hard work in order to keep working hard. If I let myself feel that I'm not working hard and stop acknowledging and being proud of my hard work, I'm not going to be motivated to keep working hard, being courageous and showing strength.

On the other hand there are some people who it feels like do acknowledge our strength. I usually come away from interacting with those people feeling encouraged to work extra hard on improving my life. My emotions, insecurities about trusting or any flashbacks calm down and I feel relaxed and at peace around them.

PTSD,"In the last few days I have tried to reconnect with a couple of friends/people who I thought I may have misjudged. With one of them I just wanted to say, ""Listen I went through a trauma, this is what happened to me and I want you to know that I was on edge with you the other day. I don't actually dislike you. I got triggered by what you said but I don't think you meant to hurt me or are a bad person and I want you to know I don't dislike you."" Instead she basically ended up defending why she should be able to say certain things to me. My intention in starting our conversation (maybe I was thinking wishfully) was to connect with her. That was disappointing to me how it ended up turning out. I felt discouraged and I still feel discouraged thinking about it. Maybe I was surprised because I thought that when she saw how much pain I was in she would end up changing her viewpoint or feel more empathy. I was and am deeply disappointed.

Unfortunately I was disappointed again this morning. I was attempting to somewhat repair a relationship with a former classmate of mine. I felt like I may have made her feel ashamed because sometimes I'm not very accurate at communicating my viewpoint. I told her, ""Listen I'm sorry I think I hurt you. I think I miscommunicated,  I did not mean it to come across this way. I meant this instead."" Then she told me that I have an absurd viewpoint and was disrespectful towards me. I was deeply disappointed again. Why do I even try ? I am disappointed. It seems like people are an endless disappointment. Honestly is it any wonder some of us shut down and stop trying to connect with people ? It's like we just give up. The heartbreak and trauma of trying and holding out hope with someone and trying for connection and then finding them unwilling to connect is heartrending. And it's sadly like another trauma to keep sustaining. I am disheartened. I know that there are some amazing people out there but finding those people is hard. 

This is particularly disheartening to me because (as far as I can see) I know that I did things ""right"" in chatting with these people. I was calm. I apologized and expressed sorrow for the parts that I felt I got wrong and for hurting their feelings. I was concerned about their feelings and yet it seems that that made absolutely no difference to them.

PTSD,"Relationships just don't feel right. Literally I've tried to date so many people of different kinds and no matter what I just can't seem to do it or if I do we only stay together a short time. I know that a lot of this is due to the trauma that happened to me. 

I don't want to ignore my gut sense or say that my gut sense is wrong. I don't want to say that my feelings are wrong. I don't want to blame myself for not having ""normal"" feelings like other people. I know that my feelings are normal given what has happened to me. I'm also not sure whether I should try out a relationship anyway. I mean I know that I can behave differently than my feelings say without saying that my feelings are wrong. Also I know that my gut sense has a purpose, to protect me so I have my reservations about going against my feelings. I don't fault myself or other abuse survivors for being confused about our feelings either and not having a clear reading of our gut sense.

I also know that I avoid relationships when I'm hurt and when having a fair relationship seems a far off dream. Connecting with other people is not my strong suit and when I feel that I'm feeling down and not in a position to enforce strong boundaries with someone, at that moment I'm hurting and I really don't feel like being close to someone. People seem particularly unappealing at that moment. Nevertheless I appreciate closeness with kind and fair people. ",traumasucks

I've been wounded (and frankly humiliated) numerous times when people say to me, ""But you parents still love you"" and that discounting makes me (literally) sick. It takes a tremendous toll on my mental health. I just do not want to feel that humiliation in a relationship and frankly I feel that there would be few people who would be able to understand my experience who haven't been through the same with their parents or aren't actively trying to combat the child abuse problem. If they are actively trying to combat the child abuse problem then I would feel different about them and safer.  ",traumasucks

I also feel like by having lost respect for me, my trust in them is something that can never be reclaimed. Even if I were to get better and they suddenly started respecting me again, I still wouldn't be able to ever trust them the same way again.

PTSD,"Having such a hard time. Mixed episode and after hearing some bad news about a family member a bunch of trauma came flooding back. I feel suicidal. I see my therapist and she understands that hospitals make it worse or aren't helpful so she suggests seeing if there are any beds at the crisis house (which works with the local hospital). But im terrified of being stuck there for the first 24 hours. I feel like I don't deserve any help. That nobody cares, im just attention seeking. Im so overwhelmed that when I look at anything fabric it looks alive and there are microscopic movements I can only see apparently. These last two weeks sleep has been sporadic and I had to stop using cannabis as my asthma is so shitty and edibles or RSO don't have any affect for pain management any longer.I asked for help in the PTSD forum but got downvoted and ignored.

PTSD,"My SIL is an ""independant consultant"" for Epicure and keeps spouting how this product will help you lose weight and make your food healthier and has *so many* benefits.

She is obese (she says ""just a little"" overweight) and thinks because she is using this she can eat whatever she wants despite wanting to lose weight. Even her ""healthiest"" meals are still covered in melted cheese, bacon bits and fatty dressing in her salads (with cheese on top), and even simple celery sticks are covered in cheese and these ""spices"" or whatever, and still complains about never losing weight.

PTSD,"Apparently when my SO called 911 for a suicide attempt I made back in 2009, this info got put into the police database and then shared with the National crime database which also gets shared with the US government (even though I'm not an American citizen my 'non criminal record' gets shared). It also explains why I couldn't go visit my friend in NYC and got denied at the border.

Well apparently this info comes up when employers do background checks. Everyone does checks these days, even if you want to just volunteer. And this makes sense as to why I never got called back for the over a hundred jobs I have applied for. I can't even volunteer as a greeter at my local hospital if I wanted to.

This is what happens when you ask for help. You get none and get screwed harder than ever for daring to have a mental illness.

Every single time my SO has called 911 on me has been recorded (I think about 3 times total over the years? Once because I went missing).

And just now my province- the only province in Canada- is the only one that decided that the police can't/should no longer be sharing such info (including info from ""carding"").

If you live in Canada and have had the cops called on you and you have been having trouble finding work or volunteer I urge you to contact your local MP and ask them to bring this up with the Speaker at the House of Commons- what are they going to do about the info already shared? Is there any plan in place to help those who have been affected by this practice? Why is such info even in a criminal database?

Guys, I am so fucking angry but relieved at the same time, because now I know it's not I who has done anything wrong or that I wasn't trying hard enough or applying enough. But I am angry that my personal info has been shared with those who have never had any business accessing such info in the first place; I am angry that I have been ''judge, juried, execution'ed'' by those who never gave me the benefit of the doubt.

Edit to add: I don't want to scare off people for calling for help. Your best bet is always to call for an ambulance even if it costs money you can get it covered at ""insurers cost"" if you talk to the hospital. And since it's now not reported by police I wouldn't hesitate to call them again if needed for anything.

Its been four years since I last was there so I needed a new referral but their wait time is over a year so I got referred to a new clinic which was closer. I went there with the intention of learning how to get off my patch and how they can help. For the first in a long time I had some hope.This morning I got to the clinic and filled out a bunch of paper work and took the pee test. I got asked some questions. Waited for a couple minutes before getting introduced to a young man who in his words is 'brand new'. Cool. We talked more about my history, physical and mental, got poked and proded. Very thorough exam. Then I was told to wait for a few minutes so he can talk to 'His boss' lol.They both came back and I was introduced to the senior specialist and was basically told they only really do ""dry needling"" but because I have a seizure risk I am not a candidate and since I don't want to take another opiate there is nothing they can do except send a letter to my physician on how to properly titrate me off it. But my physician explicitly told me he wont try it again after basically getting a bunch of seizures last time.So now I'm back in the hopeless box.

Looking through my past I've tried over 30 different medications, most of those being anti depressants, many a few being mood stabilizers. 

When is it a good time to call it quits? At what point can I have any choice in what I want (or don't want) from life?

PTSD,"You know, there are times I just cave in and ask for help. To give you a quick background of myself, I had many traumas in my life, my first two ""relationships"" were me getting raped and sexually assaulted whenever they pleased. I started developing chronic pain around the same time. I have been in a few car accidents (not my fault- I got t boned and rear ended). I was in an apartment fire where I got smoke inhalation and now I have asthma. Despite the pain I finished college with a diploma and in the end had to stop working (worked since I was 12 till 25) due to the pain. Was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis in my neck. A few years later after trying some meds for my pain which included antidepressants I found out I was bipolar with a tendency towards psychosis.   

Not long ago I was suffering a lot from bipolar and was beginning to get some delusions that people can look at me and know my thoughts. There are specific people who can do this; and so on. So my psychiatrist wanted me to try an antipsychotic, a med I have always feared to take and always declined until now, I was getting desperate and didn't want to lose control of my reality. So I was prescribed Risperidone at a low dose of .5 mg. My psych reassure me it will also help with my PTSD symptoms as well.

Well, only after 3 nights of taking it I began exhibiting EPS symptoms; like uncontrollable shaking, painful muscles feeling like they were ripping apart, basically parkinsonism. I got scared and went to the ER, where at first I felt I was taken seriously, but then I got sent to the emer psych ward before being given an anticholinergic like Cogentin. Of course I didn't want to be admitted, I just wanted to get rid of these scary side effects. Finally after 5 hours of questions and waiting around I was given some pills and then a script.

Within an hour most of my symptoms went away. What a relief! phew! I went to bed. The next day I woke up, I couldn't talk. For a lack of description I started talking like a retard. Like I had lost control of my vocal cords. I thought- well ok, maybe I just need to keep taking the Cogentin. I did but I still couldn't talk. I waited another day because maybe it was stress? I waited another day before seeing my psychiatrist and she told me it would be temporary. That it should go away in a couple days when the meds are fully out my system. ok, so lets wait for the meds to get out my system. Which sucks because I use my voice to not only advocate for myself- but I use it for my passion which is hip hop. Now that I can't rap- really the only passion in life I had- has been ripped away from me.

After a week in the psych ward after calling a hotline- where I met a friend of a friend and now we are friends- she got me to try meth (I had a very small ""bump"") and it made me seem ""happy"" enough to be released. I didn't like it so much and I don't think I will be doing it again any time soon.

But now... it's been 3 weeks since this whole voice thing started, and I still don't have it. While in the hospital I got a camera shoved down my nose so they can see my throat. It didn't hurt at all. I was diagnosed with mixed laryngeal dystonia, which is very, very rare. Apparently while in the hospital the social worker there told me they are going to set me up in another hospital with some world renowned neurologists and neuropsychs to get me talking and rapping again.

But I haven't heard back about it since I got out the hospital, so I am not sure what happening and living in this limbo is making me anxious. I can't keep waiting, passing time (days and weeks) while I whisper so people can understand me. Even whispering hurts. Trying to talk hurts. Doing the ""exercises"" I was given hurts. Massaging my neck hurts.

Geeze, they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. But I don't know how much more I can take. Seriously how much more bullshit do I have to go through? Why me? What the fuck did I do to deserve all this shit most people will never experience let alone hear of in their lifetimes? Why are people continuously telling me to ""keep trying, it gets better"" when it clearly isn't the case for my life? Or am I being really delusional right now about my circumstances? I constantly question my reality and I hate it.

I have researched a few plans since I have so much time, I wish I had access to more peaceful methods but fuck it. I live 16 floors up. I have ropes. A great SmiffnWesson knife... the most brutal ways I have access to. But I want to go peacefully like my FIL... full or morphine (he had cancer) or with ""N""... but I know nothing about how to get such things. Oh well. Looks like some unlucky person will have to deal with my left overs.

Maybe before I go I should write a fictional biography so I can leave my nephew and twin sis some money so they can finally leave jerk off daddy.

PTSD,So I admitted myself to the hospital after I lost my ability to speak normally after only 3 days of Risperidone. They had a Ear Nose Throat specialist put a camera down my nose into my throat and made me try to talk. Turns out I have laryngeal dystonia.Now lately all this stress I been hearing voices and half delusions of people reading my mind and seeing shadows dart everywhere but am now terrified of antipsychotics. I think they want to put me back on Lithium and add Clozapine or something? Apparently weekly blood tests and what not for Clozapine. Its an anti psychotic which scares me even more but apparently my doc doesnt think the Lithium alone will stop the hallucinations/delusions.So yea. Im safe at the hospital. They will provide me with a speech pathologist too so that's nice.If anyone has any experience with Clozapine I would really appreciate hearing your experience.

PTSD,"The doctors said it would go away when the triggering drug (.5 mg Risperdal) is out of my system. According to my research it takes about 5 days. 

It's been over a week since I could talk normally. When I open my mouth to order something simple like a coffee people either look terrified (and make fun of me when their back are turned) or have pity.

The worst part- the only thing that helped keep me mindful, my reason for hanging on was rapping. Now that impossible. I feel like I have nothing now.

And the worst part is no one wants to take responsibility. No one will let me see a neurologist. I am afraid the longer I wait to see it never going away the better chance of it not going away.

Of course with stress and emotion it gets worse. My FIL is to have *another* wake/get together this weekend and I don't think I can handle it. I love my SO and I know he is going through so much already plus this. I know it's driving him crazy. He is afraid for me and it makes me feel bad- like he doesn't have enough shit on his plate.

Edit:

They sent me home after giving me 4 mg Congentin. Despite telling them I am in a mixed state, suicidal, and grieving. They said to keep taking the risperdone with the congentin. But all pharmacies are closed until Tuesday. Go figure. I'm gonna stop taking the Risperidone and won't even ""cash in"" the Cogentin script.

I don't understand the point. I feel so trapped and hopeless now. No one can help, no medication will help, no amount of ""mindfulness"" will help neither, and life is just too shitty to care about going on. The hospital staff made lots of assumptions like ""well your husband must be so great and such a good guy, thats why you wont go through with it"". Like wtf? Yes my husband is great but he is not holding me back. My fear of messing up keeps me back. The fact that I can't ever have a will because I am constantly crazy.

It should help with first months rent for her anyways.

I don't know guys. I wish you can opt out of life. I wish people weren't so selfish. Why do I have to live in pain and misery so everyone else can be happy. My quality of life gets worse as I've aged, I'm not even 30. I doubt I can do another five years let alone another lifetime so to speak.

I don't eat or sleep well, I don't take care of myself or anything else. I also have chronic pain on top.. and if I'm on my period- FML.

What does being so smart have to do with not being disabled by chronic pain or mental illness? Why do they point this out all the time? Yes I am smart, but that doesn't mean my psychosis won't take over my reality. It doesn't mean the pain stops.

Being smart doesn't mean I can control my disabilities. It doesn't mean I can be as productive as I WANT to be. It doesn't mean I can ""just get a job"" even if I tried and lied. Yes I am smart.

PTSD,"When I meet with new people and get to talking, and some have kids, they *always* end up BINGO'ing me. I don't take it personally that they have kids, I didn't take it as an attack on my own autonomy until they asked me 21 questions about why I'm CF. One of the most insulting was the assumption and insinuation that I must hate children. I don't go around telling parents that I am sterile from HPV cancer because it's personal medical information that only my doctors need to know. I shouldn't ever have to explain my personal choices. I don't ask why someone decided to wear Nikes instead of Jordans, or why someone bought a BMW instead of an Audi. Because it's stupid and really trivial to be hung up on such details.

So why, when the only thing I say is ""I'm CF and won't be having children ever"" and leave it at that, that they take it as a personal attack on them and their children?

I don't get why parents get offended when someone wants to be CF. Is it jealousy? Is it because misery loves company? Is it because they regret it? I don't know and don't really care.

PTSD,"In my province the sex ed curriculum is finally being revamped (hasn't been updated since '98). It will include things like sexting, mastrubation, homosexuality, and consent. Here is a little info about it:

They begin in grade 1 with naming of body parts. Up to grade 4 they will be taught about masturbation, while the processes of menstruation and spermatogenesis remain in Grade 5. By Grade 8 is when students in will be expected to demonstrate an awareness and acceptance of transgender, transsexual, intersex and two-spirited gender identifications. The concepts of informed consent and, crucially, the communication of consent become part of Grade 7 instruction. As for the high school curriculum, heavy emphasis will be placed, appropriately, on mental health, the causes and manifestations of addictions, critical thinking and sense of self.

Parents are freaking out, and there are many campaigns to stop this much needed and updated curriculum for the kids. You know what I was taught? Abstinence. I wasn't taught anything, not even from my parents as they were super religious and wanted me to stay a virgin (whats with this virginity obsession?) You know what they lead to? My first sexual experiences were rapes because I had no idea that consent was even a thing.

But God forbid I support this and give an opinion in a debate, because what do I know, I don't have kids! Apparently if I was a mother I wouldn't want my grade 1 child learning anatomy.  And if I was a mother I shouldn't want a child learning about masturbation because they are too young (I don't know about other people but grade 4-5 is when I ""discovered"" this pleasure) and it will corrupt their pure minds. Teaching about consent in grade 7 means that every 7th grader will be having sex all day instead of learning! Teaching kids to be accepting of LGBT mean it will plant the ""gay seed"" in their minds!

But who cares what I think, I'm not a parent and never will be so what do I know, right? Fuck me for not being able to have children because I got cancer from the HPV I contracted after being raped.

I had a neuropsychoanalysis test done which I had to fight real hard for (advocating for yourself is hard to do!). I went in with bipolar 2 and bpd traits on my chart.

After the testing my psychiatrist was set straight. I was diagnosed bipolar 1 with psychotic features, mostly because I have crazy mixed episodes and not the grandiose/euphoric kind . I was also diagnosed with PTSD (car accident, fire, rapes) with OCD and social phobia. I have traits of OCPD. She also diagnosed me with Pain Disorder with both psychological factors and a general medical condition to highlight the relationship of my chronic pain and my depressive moods which makes my pain much worse.

The psychologist said that I was probably confused with a borderline due to my PTSD and OCD. She ""upgraded"" my bipolar from 2 to 1 because I have mixed episodes mostly during my depressive phases.

The only side effects I deal with is getting munchies and at first it was pretty sedating, but it wore off after the first week. Now, I feel like my normal self. Almost no pain! I sleep well! I feel happy again! I never ever thought I would get prescribed this drug in a hospital. 

Just for some background info I have fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis from whiplash. I am 28. The pain started as a teenager after my first MVA at 17. My last MVA was when I was 25. (I was t-boned as a passenger in the first, and I got rear ended in the last one).",Wattsherfayce
PTSD,"For a long time I was battling major depression. My last episode lasted 3 years. In that time I was experiencing suicidal ideations everyday. I attempted suicide once. I was put in the hospital and on medications that complicated things so I am now med free.

I decided to try a very small dose of mushrooms. It helped for a bit. I felt normal, no more suicidal thoughts. But it only lasted for a couple months. Then, I tumbled back into depression for the winter. How cliche.

Until about April of this year, I thought I was getting better. I was coping decently. But I wasn't sleeping much. I went from 8 hours to 4, sometimes 3, some nights not at all. I finished a couple projects and finally put it out for the world to see. I was the best, and nobody could touch me. Fuck all the haters.

But the lack of sleep and eating is catching up to me. The haters were right. I suck. I really do. Also now I can hear a voice telling me to jump off this bridge that I am walking over. I should jump off this highway overpass, but if I do I should make sure to aim for the emergency lanes so I don't land on someones car and create a pile up. Or maybe I should jump off my 16th floor balcony, my in-laws manage the building and I can't do that to them. 

My brain tells me that my brother who I have gone NC with for the last two years is following me and he is everywhere I look. I go to the mall and see a man- suddenly his face morphs into my brothers. I go for a walk around my 'hood to try to clear my head, this young man talking to his older neighbor- he is my brother. Why is he there though? He doesn't live around here. Or is he now, and if he is, it's probably to spy on me and tell me what a shitty sister and aunt I am. Why is he following me? Whats going on?

It tells me that life isn't worth living if this is what I have to live with. The pain. It doesn't stop. Especially if you have a couple chronic pain conditions where there is no cure. Great, I have to manage for the rest of my life? But what if I don't want to manage? What if this is not what life is supposed to be? Just managed, constantly medicated for one chronic condition or another. Why is it such a horrible thing to just check out? Everyone in my life will eventually move on after they deal with their grief. It doesn't last forever- unlike the illnesses I have to ""manage"" for the rest of my life.

If the police officer who off'd himself in the downtown precinct can do it, why can't I? Why am I told that my thinking is wrong, when all I see is fact?

There was a study that states that [depressive realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressive_realism) that this negativity may reflect a more accurate appraisal of the world but also that non-depressed individuals’ appraisals are positively biased. So who is really wrong? Why do I need to be medicated because I see the world for what it is?

This world is not as nice as people paint it to be. While there are billionaires stealing trillions of dollars while there are still 3rd world nations where people dont have food, clothing, or shelter. While there are many showing off their brand new cars, dresses, bikinis, or what have you, there are nations where women still have no rights let alone a voice, and there are 14 years old getting raped and murdered for crimes their brothers have committed.

Our leaders would rather spend billions on worthless aircraft all the while budgeting for it they have to ""cut health care costs"" so they can pay for these worthless war machines. They are ok with spending 5 million on a trip to Afghanistan riding in a suped up bullet proof Hummer, they are ok with the oil companies coming through our homes and parks and getting paid billions for selling land all the while it's residents (and wild life alike) are now homeless and dying from oil spills.

This is not a world I am ok with. And sadly there is nothing I, as an individual, can do to change it for the better. No one will listen to a crazy woman anyways. 

I can go on but I will stop for the sake of brevity. It's already a wall of text no one will read. But I needed to get these thoughts out of my head in a place where others can hopefully understand where my mind is at.

The only place I feel safe enough to talk about this is here. I know I will kill myself soon and I don't need anyone's ok. Thats why I have no one to talk to about it. I won't see my doctor. I wont go back to the hospital. I will not talk about my thoughts with anyone in real life anymore, because everyone will just think I am crazy and am ""crying for help"". It's not a cry for help. It's a cry for an end, and end to the insanity, the pain, the experience of life. I just don't want to participate in this shitty world anymore.",Wattsherfayce
PTSD,"I haven't talked to my brother for a few years. I had a suicide attempt and after calling me selfish and a drama queen he told me to stay away. So I have, even though his wife really wants me involved in my niece's life. 

Anyways lately I have been seeing my brother everywhere, or so I think I am. When I'm out at a bar, or when I'm going for a walk in my neighborhood. When I think I see him I get scared. I start getting anxiety and sometimes panic sets in. I don't know why but when this happens I feel like I am being stalked, or I am being watched. But every time I pointed it out to my SO that I thought I saw him, I was told it wasn't him. 

Is this a hallucination or a delusion or paranoia? Should I be concerned that this is a symptom or am I over thinking this? ",Wattsherfayce

PTSD,"Why can't anyone seem to think that suicide can be a rational choice? As if somehow wanting to die is ALWAYS about mental illness, even if there is none, they will make it up as they go along.

I've been misdiagnosed and put on dangerous medications all the while no one has no real fucking clue on what's really happening (or how those meds even work in the first place)- but apparently a 15 min interview is more than enough time to put some kind of label on you.

As if chronic pain and loss of quality of life is not a good reason at all. Everyone will call you selfish, but somehow it's not selfish of them to keep you in pain so they can avoid a pain that won't last nearly as long.

I've even tried writing out a schedule to follow but  still have trouble trying to do it all at once.

I feel like some kind of ""presence"" is following me and that I'm being watched. Today at the dentist I was sitting in the chair, empty room, waiting for my dentist to come in. I was watching the news on the tv ahead of me and suddenly the overhead light turned on itself, like whatever is following me is trying to let me know they are present.

I don't have a psych but Friday I'm starting CBT group therapy for Panic Disorder at the local (research) hospital.

Im not sure what to do right now. My regular doc asked me to call the local crisis line if I ever need any help, but I'm scared of getting put in the hospital.

PTSD,"I would like to share my horror story about my sister's baby shower that happened around this time last year. I will try to make it as short as possible, but I probably can't avoid a wall of text. Sorry.

 My sister, who was considered only 25% fertile by all her doctors, got pregnant. This wasn't the first time though. Her first one was an octopic (sp?) pregnancy and had to be aborted. Her second one was miscarried by the start of the second trimester. To say the least, she was terrified and surprised all at once. I could only imagine how she felt.

So when the rest of the family found out, they were very excited. My sister in law threw a baby shower for her. I was invited but declined. That didn't sit well with her and her family.

I started getting facebook messages from the SIL about how I should think of my niece, that it's about the children. I also got messages from her mother, and her aunt. All their messages were insinuating the same thing: I was being very selfish and am not thinking about the children! (my niece). I never responded because I didn't want to cause further drama for no good reason.

I declined because earlier that year I had a suicide attempt. I am SAD/bipolar and was going through a major depression. I was not diagnosed until then, so I didn't have and therapy or medication to help me cope. No one came to visit me at all during my week stay at the hospital, which started Easter weekend. I didn't expect my sister to come because she lives 200km away. When my brother found out, he basically told me to ""go fuck yourself"" and to never come around his family unless I ""get cured"", that I'm a huge bitch and only think about myself and I'm nothing but drama and a loser, and he can't be around that. He ended that until then, not to ever contact him or his family, but if I am ready to ""grow up"" then he will consider rebuilding the relationship.

So when I declined the invitation from his wife, I messaged my sister and explained why I will not be attending, but that after the shower I would love to meet up and giver her some gifts and go back home with her to help her out. My twin was super understanding and agreed that after the shower we will meet up and go back to her place and catch up.

Well that didn't sit well with the sister in-laws' family. They basically ruined my sister's baby shower with their incessant gossip about why I am not there, how I am being so disrespectful and don't care about any of the children. After an hour of trying to ignore them my sister finally busted out in tears and started yelling at them that they are the ones who are disrespectful for gossiping about me and never caring to find out the true reason of why I didn't show up. 

She blurted out that my brother banned me from his family after I attempted suicide. That I didn't come to respect my brothers' wishes for the sake of saving drama for either of us. Because I was still recovering and not up for a gathering and being BINGO'd by everyone. 

The side of my family who attended were very shocked and concerned, and her side of the family became very embarrassed, silent, and awkward. My aunts came around my sister to support her while she was crying, asking if we are ok, that if either of us feel that way to not be afraid to reach out. My sister learned one of my aunts suffers from major depression as well. For an hour they rallied around her and attempted to make her smile and laugh. SIL side of the family were silent and awkward, but SIL rallied with my family after apologizing to my sister for her and her family's behavior.

After the shower I met up with my sister and we went out for dinner before we made the trip back to her place. She told me the story about her baby shower over dinner after I gave her some gifts. We drove back to her place, I helped unload all her presents back to her apartment and we chatted well into the morning before falling a sleep on the couch. I stayed the weekend with her and her husband. We had a great ol' time!",Wattsherfayce

PTSD,"A couple years ago I admitted suicidal ideations to my pain specialist after she took me off Tramadol 150mg cold turkey (I was taking it for 3 months at this point). My specialist dismissed these thoughts before and never wanted to talk about them. But this time she took it more seriously for some reason. Without talking to me, she locked me in a room and it wasn't opened until there were a couple big burly EMS attendants there to take me away to the hospital.

When I got there, I finally felt like someone was listening. The intake nurse did a great job of listening to me and validating my emotions of being in constant, chronic pain and medication changes.

I got transferred to a psychiatric facility, and was put in the severe psychosis ward! When I got there, I had 3 other room mates. One of them was a mother who just had a baby. She was very nice and... ""sane"" in comparison. I had another woman come in a few days later, and she would keep me up all night talking about how the devil is trying to rape her and because she is in the hospital he will rape us all. There was a woman there who would wake up at 4am and start moaning as loud as she could up and down the halls until lunch time. Everyone, including staff, wanted to give her a real reason to cry about. There was a man there who was so out of it, he would always go into my room. The first day he ate dinner in my bed and then pissed in it. I had to clean it up myself. I couldn;t sleep for the first two weeks at all and started hallucinating from lack of sleep. It wasn't until my SO came to yell at the duty doctor to let me come home and get rest for the night. They started giving me night passes at this point. 

Now let's get to my doctors. Firstly, the only time I saw a real doctor was 1 every 2 weeks. I was only able to deal with residents. Every day, the resident called me stupid. He made sure he knew how stupid I was because I chose to use cannabis instead of percs and oxy's and the like to control my pain. Secondly, the already made up their mind on the diagnosis before even getting the whole story. I would refuse to take the medication they wanted to force on me because I didn't think they were right. But there are no second opinions allowed in the hospital. So after my third week there I gave in and let them prick and prod me with their needles. The medication made me feel sick all the time. I barely remember what happened during that time I was on this medication. I was released on day 28. I kept taking the medication for a month longer before I started hallucinating again. I went to my doc and told me they had me on the max dose allowable, and that it was obviously too high for me.

Ever since that happened, I have been having nightmares nightly about being dragged away to the hospital and getting locked up. I went back to the hospital again for help and my experience was much nicer. I was diagnosed with PTSD at that point, but no one will admit that the hospital stay was the ""reason/stressor"" that got me so traumatically stressed in the first place.

There is nothing I can do. The hospital is a teaching hospital and the only one in my area that has a psych ward and ""community psychiatry"".

Has anyone else ever had such an experience before? I am terrified of having the same experience, but I am also terrified I might actually kill myself one of these days because I am still too scared to ask for help again after that. ",Wattsherfayce
PTSD,"I have some serious chronic pain and mental health issues ranging from PTSD to eating disorders. I am in a a long term relationship I don't want to be in any more (9 years, recently found out he was cheating on me) and have been abused, sexually assaulted and raped. The only person I have kept in contact with from my family was my twin sister. This is because my family abandoned me after they got frustrated that I''m not getting better (imagine how I feel? I'm the one suffering here).

Any ways, my twin just had a baby boy about a month ago. 

Last night I was feeling actively suicidal, so I sent her a message on Twitter (for now our only line of communication). Albeit I was not in the best of minds, I guess the message I sent her was fucked up. I told her I loved her and that I want her to make sure my wishes get carried out when I die. 

She sent me a few messages back asking what set me off and what not, and during that time she tweeted she was tired and wanted to go to bed, so I wished her a good night, hoping she would get some sleep. 

She told me she can't sleep now because of what I told her. I apologized, but she kept refusing my apologies with ""stop lying, you aren't sorry"" and starting arguments with ""it's not natural to suicide"" but refusing to discuss her views because ""she has no energy"". So I apologize again for messaging her about my suicidal ideations and told her to just go to bed and sleep then. Again she says ""you aren't sorry, and if you are, it's wasted energy"".

Of course being in a suicidal mind state that made my emotions more intense so I said ""fuck it, I don't care what you think any more. Good night. Have a good life"". 

Well I guess that didn't make her happy because she went off on a tangent stating ""yea, get mad at the sleep deprived mom who has a baby screaming in her ear the whole night! You're mad at me because I am essentially confirming what you told me!""

Because it was late at night I decided not to reply back and let things cool down. Later that night/morning I sent her a message apologizing for putting her in such a position. She said I could come to her with anything any time. I guess not any more since she has her own family to worry about now, and from now on I will avoid any conversation on the topic of how I am feeling.

She later apologized as well stating she was running on 2 hours sleep and should of have known better.

I was supposed to go visit her and see my little nephew for the first time, but now I don't want to. I think it would be better if we kept low-contact instead, to avoid any more outbursts between us. I just feel like I have lost my only support now because she has more important worries like her son. I feel so trapped and alone now.

I don't know why I am typing this up, but I felt this was a safe place to express what's on my chest.

Thank you for reading. 

**Edit to add:**

I just don't understand why she would keep telling me that I'm not sorry when I apologized. She does this every time I talk to her, even about mundane things, even before the baby.

I feel extremely guilty for having no one else to rely on because I did this all to myself. I reach out to people and they either get scared, tell me I am manipulative, or they get angry and tell me to go ahead and kill myself or not to talk to them until I get my shit together.
 
No one seems to understand what chronic pain can do to a person. I only have 4 hours sleep a night if I am lucky, so I do understand what it is like going on no sleep.

For a year I had severe depersonalization, to the point that when I looked down at my hands, they werent mine. There were a couple times when my therapist wanted me to be hospitalized, though I never was. I spent about two years suicidal, until I made a conscious decision that I didn't want to die, and I was going to try and beat this (PTSD in general and what had happened to me).

In the past 6 months or so, my life went from not even worth living to a struggle but worth it (sometimes) to a place where I'm actually generally content most of the time. It's far from perfect, but most of the time I actually feel ok and don't want to die.

The two things that helped me most were quitting weed (I think it may help some, but for me it made my head spin and I was essentially addicted), and being as open as possible with people. My life changed completely when I made open facebook posts about what I was struggling with and got a lot of support, even though I had isolated myself from almost everyone in the couple years prior.

Also, I love music, so I've added music commentary to each point to help push you in the right direction!

1. Talk to Someone.
Opening up is hard. I know you don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. No one does. It feels awkward. It hurts. We're afraid. We're ashamed, though we shouldn't be. But this is how you get past PTSD. So take some time and hit up an old friend whose willing to hear your story. I promise you will feel better for it (depending on if you've done this before or not, ALOT better). Here is a song about opening up, and the Indecision and fear you can feel about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF8okFt4bGg&feature=kp

2. Talk to a Therapist.
A lot like number one, this is something that no one wants to do. If you're like me, you will say you'll find a therapist tomorrow and it goes on and on and on... Possibly until you're out of tomorrows. Life is short, and a great therapist is the one of the most helpful things in a PTSD recovery, so don't make the same mistake I did... Don't Wait! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5P3OXB7ZOE

3. Develop Your Spirituality.
Spirituality is so great for PTSD. Looking at things in a deeper sense allows you to free your mind. Whether it be Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Mormonism, or just quotes from a website, spirituality can be a great source of relief and help you view your trauma(s) from an objective perspective. This also includes meditation and guided imagery, which was encouraged to me by my therapist. You can find all you need about that here!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vO1wPAmiMQ

4. Loosen Your Grip.
It is REALLY hard to let go of PTSD.... If it were easy everyone would do it. That's why I say loosen your grip. Those closed doors you think about, just open them a tiny crack. You might be surprised how much it helps! Find the light~ Broken people get recycled. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E4-9yKTv_I

5. Help Others.
When you have PTSD, it's hard to think about anyone else. But helping others is a great way to feel emotions, simply because it is such a genuinely good feeling. If you're inspired, you could even make your own 10 steps to recovery! And maybe those you help can help you too.. It's always good to have someone to Lean On! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HqL5eqmGFY&feature=kp

6. Get a Hobby.
It's good to take your mind off things every once in awhile! Find something you love! About a year ago someone told me to do this but I was so depressed I just kind of shook it off, like there was nothing for me. But I was so wrong.... I found music, and a number of other things to follow/indulge in. So, what have you always wanted to do? Here's your chance! (Forgive me, I'm gonna go with a very generic song here, but it's actually the one that's helped me most in my recovery) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fog5ZJ_l4U8

7. Listen to Other's Struggles with PTSD (don't be ashamed).
One of the hardest things in my recovery is not being ashamed... I mean, one of my traumas involves my ex cheating on me with someone I really hated and then getting bullied to ridiculous degrees. It took me a long time to see this any other way then ""I'm the worst."" But that's wrong. I may feel that way sometimes, but I know it's not true. A lot of that's because of hearing what others have been through and relating. So although it's really painful, maybe you can see it as a beautiful kind of pain. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lxtPe8GC3I
Note: Eminem was bullied. a lot. if he can get through it, you can too!

8. Socialize.
I know, your life is hell... I used to tell myself people didn't know what hell was until they had been inside my head. And to some extent, that's true. But the world keeps going, with or without you. And it's a lot more fun to be with it. People can be scary too. Early in my recovery sending text messages gave me panic attacks. But this is something that faded over time, and although people sometimes scare me, possibly rightfully so, there is one thing that EVERYBODY does. We All Try. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Q6HYJOo2M

9. Be Real.
One of the toughest on the list.... I still struggle with this on a very fundamental level. But when you are hurting, tell someone. Let someone help you. A lot of people struggle with PTSD because they try to hide it. They don't tell anyone when something is wrong. But we ALL have the power to do it. And it's by being real that we get better and back into the world we love. And P.S.: if you are afraid to be yourself, listen to the world's number one rapper talk about his struggle with (what I think is) PTSD, and his final thoughts on his brilliant album (which I highly recommend to any PTSD sufferer; I would be, literally, dead without it). Love yourself enough to be real with yourself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJ3sdPtrFs

10. Try.
This is the hardest one. This is also the most important one. This one is everything. You could have all other nine but without number ten, you won't make it. You HAVE to try. I know what it feels like to be so depressed you can't move. If that's you, muster up all the strength you have and email a local therapist/psychiatrist. You'll never know if you don't try. And if its worth anything, I believe in you! There's a way, I know. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_wvRuXEd9E

And so, there you have it! I really hope that this reaches someone in need. Good luck in your recoveries! If you can do these 10 things, it wont be a matter of ""if"" you recover, but ""when.""

PTSD,"Context: I went to a laser light show (think of a movie theatre, but instead of a movie it's music and corresponding lasers) with my friend and some of his friends. Awkward because I had never met them before and suddenly I felt this huge rush of emotions and thought about all my traumas and began to cry. Nobody could see because it was dark but I was going through an emotional ride for the 45 minute show. So obviously by the time I got home I was freaking out........

Email: I think that the fact that you cried as you did is a HUGE step forward despite the sense of awkwardness and some need to temper it given the circumstances. This is the way you are going to “heal” from the traumatic symptoms you have been experiencing for so long now. Yes, it does not feel good, safe and is very confusing and frightening, especially your understandable defenses kicking in and trying to hold you back. After so many years of feeling as if you had to hold so much inside, it certainly does not come easily, so the fact that you feel as if you are bouncing between feeling everything and numbing yourself is understandable. Either end at this point clearly feels terrible (too many overwhelming feelings or being disengaged from the world) and is terribly confusing and makes you wonder if this will ever get better. The crying is your mind and body’s way of letting you know that this is the direction you will need to go in order to move through this seemingly impenetrable barrier. As awful as whole process is, you and I both know that this is truly your only way “out” of this horrible feeling of being stuck, depressed or numb, confused and terrified of moving out of your protective “bubble.” The fact is that even though you experience it as a much bigger and stronger barrier, it is actually a “container” with a door inviting you out and back into the world that you both desire and fear. It is Okay to do this at your own pace, but to a certain degree it is somewhat like closing your eyes and jumping off the edge of a ledge into deep and safe water that appears to be far too unknown, shallow and very dangerous. The latter is an illusion that comes from your default defensive stance you had to use as a child and have felt unable to give up given how unsafe it feels. Try to keep in mind that although this is a very hard process/struggle, you are no longer that vulnerable and helpless little boy that had no other options and are now a young adult that not only does have other options, but you ARE capable enough to get—and truly live comfortably—on the other side.

PTSD,"Hello everyone. I'm a long time lurker. I've rarely posted here, but I come in to check on the subreddit from time to time. Here are some thoughts I've been having:

1. Mental health communities tend to become a bit of a negative drag emotionally because you turn to them in crises/while feeling intense emotions/needing to express those emotions. Is there a way we can become a more tight-knit community? To get people to come to the subreddit daily, on good and bad days, for support, encouragement, success stories and tips you might have discovered that help you with a symptom. I really would love to see this subreddit evolve into something like that.

2. Many posts have only one or two responses. What if we made general threads that were maintained so we could express and expand on a single theme. ""How are you today?"" kind of threads. ""Post something awesome that happened to you today."" I want this to be PTSD focused but there is so much more to recovery than mainly discussing symptoms. The right kind of community, online or in person, can really make the recovery process much better. We could make a ""venting"" thread, etc. 

3. Are there any mods here? Hi! 

4. Posting links to resources/self help articles/scientific studies might liven up discussion and help people make connections.

Is anyone else vibing on what I'm saying?

Here's some stuff about me: I'm a 23 year old female. I've been in numerous kinds of therapy and have (mostly) recovered and stabilized in my PTSD. I ran a tumblr for a while that updated my progress and self help tips for a long time. But I noticed that the community would continue to be very negative, because people who felt bad posted more than people who were feeling good/improving. The truth is, when people recover/improve, they move on from support communities. But we NEED those people around to help bring us up/give sound advice.

Anyone else have any ideas/comments? Am I totally off base here? ",octo-ober

PTSD,"On January 26, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the protocol for MAPS' upcoming study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD in couples. Led by Principal Investigator Michael Mithoefer, M.D., and Sub-Investigator Candice Monson, Ph.D., this will be a pilot Phase 1/Phase 2 open-label study exploring Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) integrated with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Candice Monson, a developer of CBCT, was introduced to MAPS by the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD.

The study will enroll 10 pairs of participants, each with one participant diagnosed with PTSD, and one concerned significant other who does not have PTSD. There are several important reasons to include significant others in PTSD treatment, in addition to the data supporting the efficacy of CBCT for PTSD. MDMA will be administered to both participants to help facilitate communication and connection between participants and therapists.

PTSD,"It took me weeks to even write this, but I've been wanting to since the moment it happened. 

Had to go to the doctor to adjust my meds, and discovered that my usual family doctor was gone! At the time I thought it was no big deal; I've seen the other one for different stuff before. But then when I told my *fucking medical professional* my diagnosis and symptoms, he felt the need to lecture me for several minutes first about ""not letting the past control you"" and ""just letting it go"" before he would write my new prescription. 

I have no idea how you get a medical degree without figuring out that's a shitty,  unhelpful thing to do. Did he expect me to have some kind of epiphany? Become magically cured? The best I could do was interject a few times that I was already seeing a therapist. And when he finally *did* write my scrip, he only gave me a month. He seriously wants me to go back and listen to his bullshit every month... It just feels like he's holding my medication hostage... 

I don't know what I'm going to do yet. Honestly, I'm a little bit tempted to go back for my first appointment, just so I can respond to him with anger instead of shock and shame. But I'm sure that's not actually very helpful... 

Anyway, thank you for reading. I feel a little better just having let it out. Any rants of your own to share? If you need a dose of catharsis, I'd love to listen.",tigalicious

PTSD,"My fiance [30M] and I [25F] have been poly since day 1 and it's wonderful. He has a lot more free time than me at this point in our lives, so he often has at least one other sexual/romantic relationship in his life. And they're usually really sweet people that are easy to get along with.

But. No matter how well we actually do get along, I always feel a little resistant to the idea that I *have to* make nice with this person. He got to choose them out of the vast wonder of the internet and then build a relationship with complete freedom to let it be whatever comes naturally. On the other hand, I get presented with this person and it would be *really really great* if I became best friends or even lovers with them as well.

We've talked about it, of course, and fixed specific things that were contributing to that problem... But it's still a thing I feel every time. I know that's what he wants, so of course he tries to orchestrate ways for it to happen, but it just... automatically feels off.

Does anyone else deal with the same feeling? Did you find any solutions that helped? Or is that kind of just a normal bit of awkwardness in poly life?",tigalicious

PTSD,"So I have this obnoxious co-worker... I'm compulsively polite to people, especially when I'm uncomfortable, so we've had a few not-completely-awful conversations when we find each other in the same place for meetings and such. But oh my god. Today he approached me out of the blue and trapped me in a half-hour conversation about all of his sexist beliefs about the differences between men and women, and an entire play-by-play of his recent date with some poor woman.

I guess he follows the ""never admit that you're a Twerp"" rule though? Literally a part of our conversation:

""So, I met this girl over the weekend, and- Have you ever heard of a shit test?""

""Oh my God, are you an actual red piller?!""

""No! I don't even know what that is!""

""They're internet misogynists who use terms like 'shit test'. So where did you pick up that term then, if not from there?""

""Oh, I read some psychology thing. And I know it's not from red pill because someone asked 'this sounds like something from red pill', and they said 'it isn't'.""

I didn't have the heart to tell him how transparent that sounds. But at least it made the rest of our conversation much more entertaining for me. There was *so* much that made me want to cringe or get angry with him, but all I could do past that point was laugh. It's certainly been an interesting day.",tigalicious

I'd like to find something with both an easy-to-understand visual for shorthand, but a solid explanation of how those numbers were found as well, in case it comes up with someone who wants to challenge it or discuss it more in-depth. If you have a good suggestion, I'd really appreciate your help!

And, of course, a discussion on wage gaps is welcome as well. :) The thing that actually brought this up for me was a discussion of common rebuttals like ""women just *choose* to not make money"", or ""I guess black men *just happen to* not be the best candidate for the job as often"", and how UGH it feels to hear them again and again.",tigalicious
PTSD,"Looking at my life, I genuinely think I'm doing well. I'm learning how to recognize my triggers, making sort-term strategies to help me get through day to day, and long-term strategies to try to beat them.

But it feels like there's no end... Like every time I've thought I'm getting over something, it just manifests in another, less literal way. Talked through my fear of intimacy? Time to develop panic attacks around karaoke machines! Becoming less hypervigilent about physical assault? Better make up for it by becoming hypervigilent about car accidents!

PTSD,"I've been practicing non-monogamy for a few years now, but in this particular relationship for only about six months. In many ways, it's the happiest I've ever been. 

However. Last night was also the *fourth* time that my partner has ""forgotten"" to tell me something that we explicitly agreed to inform each other about. I'm livid, and depressed, and worried about whether I can continue the relationship at all. 

And maybe it's petty, but the whole calm, collected dance of ""I feel [emotion]. I need [action] in the future"" is just so... toothless.  I'm miserable. I'm angry. All of the monogamous people in my normal support network *already* think I'm a doormat simply because of the relationship style we chose. And it feels like the only person who doesn't want to purposefully make him feel as miserable as I am is only about 60% of myself.

It's just *hard* to contain it sometimes. I don't want to argue. I want to productively discuss *why* this keeps happening, and what options we have for ending this pattern. But another part of me just wants to yell and throw things like an angry gorilla. 

How do you do it? Please tell me it's worth it, somehow, to keep trying to keep my cool. I know that I can. I'm just doubting whether I should.",tigalicious
PTSD,"I admit, this is a shameless request for reassurance, lol. But also an invitation for discussion on the subject!

Personally, I have a really low pain tolerance. I'm very expressive, and can be pushed to safeword very easily. I know that means I need to be careful about communicating limits with my play partners. But I still worry about being a less fun/less satisfying submissive... On the other hand, I also really value myself as I am, and I feel like something would be lost if I became less sensitive... (I don't switch at all, so I can't comment on that side of things, lol)

So what is your opinion on pain tolerance? Is there value in the ""ouch"" reaction, or do you prefer the exertion, bruising, etc. that comes with higher pain tolerance?

PTSD,"I've never been in a relationship for more than a year.  Not since the first one, which I'm still trying to recover from...  I've dated several lovely people, but I always find a reason to break up after six months to a year.  Some friends tell me that's because they weren't good enough partners for me, while others tell me that I'm just running away as soon as I start feeling trapped by the implication of long-term commitment to someone.  And I don't know which is true.  More importantly, I don't know which is motivating me now.

I've been in a relationship with my current partner for a little over a year.  And we're good together.  We laugh together, live the same lifestyle, want the same future, all that stuff.  He's even helped me overcome some of my old triggers.  On my good days, I love him and we're super compatible.  On my bad days, I can't find any emotions in myself besides fear and panic and sadness, and all I want is to run. 

I can list reasons for wanting to break up that sound perfectly rational.  (He's lied to me in the past, I identify as poly but he wants a monogamous relationship, it bothers me that *he's* bothered by the fact that I'm taller than him and more ambitious, we argue about political beliefs sometimes.)  But I don't trust myself, because I also know that I'm going through this irrational, internal panic response all the time...  So maybe I'm just looking for reasons to justify that.  I mean, no relationship is perfect, and none of those problems are actually big issues in our relationship.  

I'm afraid of staying, and finding out that I'm just legitimately unhappy in this relationship.  But I'm also afraid of continuing my pattern of running away, and never getting over this fear of other humans.

We've talked about what I'm feeling, and he has said that he'd support my decision, if I really think that breaking up is the right decision for me.  But I'm stuck.  I don't know...  Help?",tigalicious
PTSD,"Dear sir,

That is some serious bullshit.

Short of a long, targeted campaign to classically train you, the way I speak to you in public has no effect whatsoever on your internal character traits.  Your masculinity (and femininity) come from within you.  Just like mine belongs to me.  They're part of what makes us individuals.  It would *never* occur to me to accuse someone of ""de-feminizing"" (or emasculating) me.  Because, frankly, that doesn't make sense.

I do try to be as polite as possible.  I have to.  I don't want to be labeled ""brassy"" or ""a bitch"".  But ""bossy""?  Sure.  Because that's really the same thing as ""emasculating"", isn't it?  It's based on the premise that masculinity is created by performing Dominance Theater, and is destroyed when someone in the room doesn't play along.  But frankly, if your masculinity was coming from within you instead of being generated in the air between us, you would find yourself responding to me in a coded-masculine way.  But, since you haven't, your next line of defense is to blame *me* for magically creating (read: revealing) your coded-feminine response.

I'm not trying to insult you.  Actually, I think androgyny is an attractive trait.  But not insecurity, or a tendency to respond to insecurity by lashing out at your coworkers for accidentally stepping on your false reputation.  So no, I am not going to stop being myself in your presence so you can pretend to be someone else.  But I do hope you reflect on my ""defiance"", and someday grow to appreciate the beautiful masculine *and* feminine qualities that you have.  

Knowing that you will never read this, I remain not-yours,

Tig

PTSD,"It seems almost silly to admit, but I've just recently been noticing how often anti-feminist arguments around here seem to actually be hyperbolic rants...  The ones that stick out to me most are exaggerations of verbal or written disagreements as ""violence"", ""silencing"", ""censorship"", etc.  To me, those kinds of words just pass right over exaggeration and fall into ""back away very slowly"" territory, because they just don't seem connected with reality.  I mean, if there is some kind of vast, powerful feminist conspiracy, then I've been missing a lot of opportunities at a career in spreading political correctness, or whatever they think is going on...

What do you think causes those kinds of perceptions?  *Are* they perceptions, or just exaggeration as communication tools?  Are there other, similar attitudes that I'm missing and should be more aware of?  What do you think is the best way to respond?",tigalicious
PTSD,"I'm relatively new to the lifestyle, but I'm *very* new to actually interacting with my local community and such.  I recently got into one of those ""so how did you know that you were kinky"" conversations, and I was kind of surprised by everyone's stories!  I've come to expect huge varieties of different viewpoints, but these were surprisingly uniform.  

The general theme seemed to be ""I was born this way"", with stories about BDSM being involved in their very first developments of sexuality.  I ended up feeling like the odd man out when it came to my turn, and I felt like I had to ""come out"" as someone who had learned to love it.  I was never interested in BDSM until I needed it to help me process the abuse I went through in a completely vanilla relationship.  It began as a sort of self-therapy, and quickly became just a part of my life.

I guess what I'm asking is: how did y'all get started?  In your own experience with other kinky folks, is ""born this way"" really that common of an idea, or was my experience some kind of fluke?",tigalicious
PTSD,"I'm dealing with an anniversary lately...  It's been five years since what I call ""my major event"", as of two weeks ago.  And I have been drunk for every day of this month.  This has never happened before; I always love the Christmas season!  But for some reason this year I've been really falling apart over it...

My life is very different since getting away from my abuser...  I keep starting relationships and then dumping them months later.  I drink too much.  I avoid being social, because I want to keep control over my environment, but I'm also afraid of saying ""No"" when I need to...

But you know, there's a lot of talk about ""ruined lives"".  My life isn't ruined.  It's smaller, and more cautious.  But I'm also stronger, and educated enough to be an ally to others going through the same things.  I've been given the opportunity to have really deep, bonding conversations with my mother and some of my friends, and hopefully others in the future, too.  I have a form of empathy that it seems many people don't...  But that's something I can be proud of.

There are a lot of ways that my life is different than it would have been.  But it is not worth less.  I am not worth less.  There is a lot of silver lining that I've lost sight of recently.  Even being in the middle of my struggle right now, it's comforting to be reminded.  As survivors, we are not worth less.  In some ways, I think we're actually worth more, especially to each other.  I just had to share that thought somewhere, and hopefully this is a good place for it.  Thanks for reading, if you've made it to end, lol.  I hope you're all doing well, and that we can be there for each other if we're not.",tigalicious
PTSD,"I need advice... Is this a thing?  

My first serious relationship was with an abuser.  By the end of it, we went through the cycle of abuse like clockwork.  I literally started planning my life around the knowledge that every 2-3 weeks I would be spending the weekend locked up in the house with him, going through the explosion then apology part of it.  Then I'd be able to work and function normally for about a week before the tension buildup had me walking on eggshells again.

I'm finally in a long-term relationship again, and I'm realizing...  I think I'm still going through the cycle on my own.  Every week or two I start getting tense and depressed, followed by an implosion where I sort of stop functioning for no reason.  I try to reassure my boyfriend that it's not because of him, that it's something self-generated, but it still hurts him...  He still thinks that if he was better somehow or did something different, I wouldn't go through it anymore.

The only thing I'm sure of is that it's not because of my current partner.  But, I'm still trying to figure out what it really is and how to stop...  Does that make sense as an explanation for this pattern I keep cycling through?  If I've been trained into it, how can I train myself back out?  I'm wary of covering up my issues through meds instead of fixing them, but how can I tell whether I'm just chemically depressed or going through hormonal cycles or something, or if it really is only because of my past?

PTSD,"I think my very first ""win"" after getting my abuser out of my life was when I noticed my cat wasn't having nightmares anymore.  I had never even realized until it was just me and him in the house, but he growled and clawed when he slept, and acted scared when I woke him up.  It took a while before he woke up happy again.  And it helped me a lot to have something to care for, and to see that moving on was really possible.  It's just a quicker process for cats, I guess.

What are your victories?  Story time!  A place to celebrate the silver linings and the ""how far I've come""s.",tigalicious
PTSD,"I've been stuck on this question for awhile, and I was hoping that inviting some new thoughts could help...  

For awhile I've identified as atheistic pagan.  However, I'm informed that I'm ""not allowed"" to make things like that up, by atheist and pagan friends alike.  But neither term on its own seems sufficient.  Accepting a religious label invites people to think that I ""actually"" believe in gods, because of the whole fundamentalism craze for the past couple hundred years.  And the idea of an actual mythical creature out there doesn't make any sense.  But from a practical standpoint, rituals, wonder, and symbolism can be really useful in attaining and maintaining happiness.  I don't see any reason why my personal symbols and rituals deserve less respect just because they're *more* thought-out than attending my parents' church and swallowing their kool-aid.  

How do you define belief?  Is it necessary to believe in mythical creatures in order to call your ideals and symbols  ""gods""?  Or am I describing non-belief with normal human emotions attached? ",tigalicious
PTSD,"It's really important to me to try to dig out every last leftover symptom of abuse that I experience.  That bastard does not deserve the power to affect me in any way.  And I had a victory!

One of the things that's been really hard to change...  is that it's hard for me to sleep next to a partner.  The more I care about him and trust him, the scarier it is.  I trusted my ex, too...  And it was just shattering to try so hard to leave my heart open every day to someone who may or may not abuse it.  And he hated to acknowledge it; I could never take time to heal because he was watching all of the time, trying to make sure my mask of happiness never slipped.  The only time I ever had to myself was after he had fallen asleep, when I could cry or even frown without being yelled at.  

But it's been years...  And it kills me that I haven't gotten over it.  I have a wonderful partner who would never do any of that.  And I still stay up at night sometimes worrying about how his hands might betray me, or if I do get to sleep quickly I get nightmares.  But I found something that helps!  I asked him to touch my face when I'm scared.  When he knows I'm having a bad night he doesn't even have to wake up to help.  I just need the contact.  And after awhile I can already tell the difference!  I'm learning new habits of falling asleep happy instead of scared and miserable.  I'm learning to associate the hands of the man I love with comfort and peace instead of fear.  With his help, I'm literally training my brain out of it.  It's working!

I feel like with things like this, it's really hard sometimes to feel like you're getting anywhere, you know?  Dealing with those long-term symptoms is such a process that you often can't pinpoint milestones to celebrate, just bad stuff to get down on yourself for.  So if you'd care to join me for a celebration:  What victories in healing have y'all had?  Getting free, learning how to recognize your abuse for what it was, taking little parts of your life back?  I'm just digging the positivity of taking a while to focus on that.  ",tigalicious
PTSD,"So the consequences of letting myself get into a ridiculous mess of newbie poly drama are finally coming through.  I'm currently with only one partner, who is extremely new to this and let himself get emotionally involved with a monogamous girl.  Turns out they're physically involved as well, and didn't use protection.

So what do I do?  I've never dealt with something like this.  I've asked that he ask her to be tested as soon as possible of course, and I told him I needed to figure out how to feel medically safe before we have sex again.  I resent the idea of having to use condoms in our relationship, which is kind of a downgrade physically and gets in the way of intimacy emotionally.  I don't think it's unreasonable to ask that he use protection with her from now on, until we know what her status is, but I still just don't feel safe.  I resent the idea that now I am going to have the nagging worry for six months that *I* might be given an uncurable disease because of my dude's dumb decision.  Hell, all of a sudden I feel like I'm dating an uneducated teenager.  The whole ""not dying of HIV"" thing seems pretty basic to me.

I guess that's kind of a rant, sorry.  But, what do you *do* in this situation, where there has already been unsafe activity, in a logistic sense and emotional?  I'm feeling lost.  I feel unsafe physically being with him now, but I feel more unsafe emotionally having to have this barrier between us all of a sudden.  It just doesn't seem fair.",tigalicious
PTSD,"I'm very new to polyamory, my current partner even more so.  It's a new relationship, but he seems to have already slipped and fallen into a fling with a monogamous girl.  I'm still a rookie myself and I know this is a total mess.  Tonight the inevitable ""if you're serious about me then dump your girlfriend"" ultimatum went down, and he rushed off to try to explain in person why valuing our relationship and his own freedom doesn't diminish how much he values their connection as well.  Everyone's being civil, but there's lots of hurt going around.  We've talked extensively about situations like this in theory, but he's currently learning the hard way how things like this often go.

The crazy thing is, while I'm sick with worry over the fact that my sweetie is in pain over this, I'm not scared.  I trust that he does value me and our relationship.  With the emotional skills I've learned through reading books, lurking and throwaways accounts here, and practice over the past year, I figured out how to identify and ask for exactly what I need to feel safe and loved in this crisis, and the only turmoil I'm left with while I'm sitting here at home is worrying about what my best friend must be going through.  I learned how to feel real trust in my partner and how to face the fact that if that trust is misplaced, I will still be okay.

I just want to say thank you to everyone who comments or submits here.  This is the single most helpful resource in helping me grow into a strong, happy poly person.  And frankly, this is probably the only place I can gush about how proud I am of hitting this personal milestone.  My exploration into polyamory has never really gone through serious problems before, and I'm very proud and thankful that I'm handling it with such solid ground under my feet.  So thank you for being a part of this wonderful community.  It makes the world a brighter place.",tigalicious

PTSD,"I apologize if this is a touchy question, but I've been mulling over the ways that sexism, heterosexism, and cissexism can overlap.  The personal catalyst for it is that I have an ex, really the only long-term relationship I've had in my life so far, who was a trans man who I recently realized was also a misogynist.  It took years to see, and it blew my mind to realize it.  He wasn't out when we met, and when he was presenting as female he was the biggest feminist I knew.  As he transitioned though, he suddenly morphed into a douche.  I could never make any sense of it until now, but I finally realized that he just couldn't stand being treated like a girl.  Once he had the option of being on top of an oppressive system for once, though, he gave in to the temptation to support it.  

Talking to him personally isn't an option, but I still want to understand it from all sides, you know?  Has anybody else experienced a difference in their feelings about gender roles or sexuality as their hormones or other factors in their lives shifted during transitioning?  Or is this a pattern that anyone else has noticed?  Or just have thoughts really?  I guess I'm really just casting for different perspectives so I can understand this whole phenomenon in a fair and complete way.",tigalicious
PTSD,"For some reason lately I've been wanting to tell my story.  It happened years ago, and I finally feel like I have enough distance from the situation to be able to put it together clearly and firmly.  I feel like it would help to say this somewhere that I won't have to defend myself or make a loved one feel bad on my behalf.  So, trigger warning, but here it is.

I was 19, and dating a real piece of work.  Nothing was said about it for years after this incident, but we never both drank at the same time again...  

A party was winding down, a few months into our relationship.  The only people left were the truly trashed, and I happened to be the only female.  This guy who I inexplicably loved intensely, gave the other three guys permission to do what they wanted to me.  They did not have my permission.  I immediately freaked out, pushed everyone away from me, and curled up crying in the corner.  Other dudes back off.  Boyfriend sits down next to me, kisses me, comforts me, tells me that this experience will bring us closer together.  Tells me that we have so much love between us that it's not fair to keep it to ourselves.  Tells me that I'm free to say no, and I'm free to leave whenever I want, but he's going to be going through with the situation with or without me.

I was wasted, so I couldn't drive home.  I was thirty miles away from home, so I couldn't walk.  I couldn't afford a cab.  It was December; I couldn't just go outside and sleep in my car.  And I couldn't handle the thought of sitting out there all night while the man I loved...  I didn't see any other choice.  Go along with it or instantly dissolve the biggest relationship I had ever experienced.  So I went along with it.

I did not consent.  I did not make a questionable drunk decision that I regretted later.  There is no way to spin this so that it was okay.  It was the most physically and emotionally painful experience of my life.  And it is complete bullshit that I did not feel like I had the right to ""make other people feel guilty"" by even admitting to myself *for years* that I was gang raped by my own boyfriend.

And for a quick soapbox moment, it is bullshit that I have to be afraid that if I posted this in anywhere else in reddit, I would probably have to justify every little detail of why my rape was rape.  This should be something that is safe to say anywhere.  I hate having conversations trying to convince people that alcohol being involved =/= ""mutual rape"".  I'm so tired of having to convince people to just be supportive, and wondering if they would tell me that I, too, am just crying wolf if I told them about my experience.  They weren't there.

And here I am passive-aggressively trying to prove myself, I guess.  Maybe I'm not as over it as I thought.",tigalicious
PTSD,"I'm considering getting involved with a guy I have some bad history with.  I was once the ""other woman"" outside of his monogamous relationship.  Believe me, I completely understand how wrong and just basically screwed up that whole situation was.  I was still trying to figure out polyamory, and neither of us dealt with the whole situation well at all.  

Recently, though, he's become single and interested in learning about polyamory and pursuing an actual relationship.  I would really like to try that, too.  I love him intensely.  I'm not worried about him betraying me in the same way that he did in his last relationship, mainly because I don't even require prior knowledge of other women to feel okay with my partners getting involved with them.  I prefer a need to know/if I ask approach.  

I still have a basic problem with this idea, though...  And I'm having trouble articulating it.  I think it has less to do with cheating, and more to do with the way that whole arrangement affected me, too.  I guess in a way I've been too busy feeling guilty and terrible for the damage I helped create in his other relationship, that I've never even stopped to consider how it damaged my feelings for the guy, to be told that I was deeply loved while still being kept in the closet with no intention of ever being honest about our relationship to others...

I'm not sure if this is a poly problem, really, or if I even deserve help.  I got myself into this.  But I figure if I could get good advice anywhere, this would be the best place to come.  So do you have any insight that I haven't managed to see?  I need to figure out what my issue really is before anything more can progress with this guy.

I've had issues with sex addiction in the past, but it was only a minor issue in a relationship. I'm a fiercely loyal and monogamous girlfriend. Now that I've left him I've been sleeping with anyone who will let me get my hands on them, both men and women (don't worry, everything's been safe). I've never been like this before. Before this little phase I never ""slept around."" I had only slept with one person I wasn't in a relationship with and honestly didn't enjoy it much and figured I wouldn't do it again. Total, I'd slept with four guys, three in long term relationships and one not.

Since my ex and I split in the beginning of the year, I've slept with four different men and one woman. I miss him so much and I am just so desperate to get my mind off him, but now I feel like a cheap whore. People say rebounding is supposed to make you feel better... I just feel worse now.

I left him because we were long distance, and he paid practically no attention to me. I was lucky to get a couple texts a day, and it drove me crazy. I was always worried that he was hurt or that he was mad but didn't tell me (fortunately, I had enough self awareness to *mostly* keep this to myself, because I knew it was unreasonable and would be off putting to communicate).

It took a lot to leave him because he wasn't meeting my needs. It was even harder to not give into my desires to contact him today to try to reconcile. It would be easier *right now* to go back to being in a predictable situation of steady discomfort, but in the long run, I would look back and regret it.

PTSD,"Hello everyone! After being on disability for about 9 months, I think I'm finally ready to go back to school. I'm looking to enroll in a 6-month-long program that will cost between $10,000 - $20,000. So not too bad compared to what some people deal with.

Here's the thing: my dad is very anti-government (think something like a real-life Ron Swanson), and does not file taxes, has defaulted on his credit cards, and has no ""recorded"" income. My mother is in a similar situation. Because of this, my sister (UC bound) and I have discovered that we do not qualify for any government support and will have to rely almost entirely on scholarships and loans. Apparently you cannot consider yourself an independent for the FAFSA until you're 25 or something.

Fortunately for me, the amount I'll have to pay to go to school is pretty little, and I would be very interested in taking out a loan to pay for it. I have not successfully been able to build any credit yet, and I feel like a small-ish loan like this would work perfectly for me, assuming I can find one...

So, reddit, any advice on what I can pursue here? I don't really know where to start and am afraid of being bombarded by ads and scams... I'm 23, I use Bank of the West, I'm on disability, and currently living under my father's roof (I feel really pathetic admitting all that and feel the need to point out that this is due to medical issues that prevent me from living alone - I was completely independent about a year ago).

PTSD,"Hi everyone.

I have a little 7 lb mutt who is my pride and joy. She's super cute and super well-behaved. However, I went to run errands, and somehow she fought her way into a home-made box of fudge under my tree while she was alone. I would say she ate about two ounces of Rocky Road.

I immediately called her vet and asked if I should being her in. Fortunately they told me that she was likely below the cusp of emergency, as long as she's behaving normally (which she has been). They said all they'd do there would be to induce vomiting, which she'll likely do on her own, and to bring her in if she gets any more sickly.

So far, she barfed a little, she took a second (normal) poop, she's a little bloated, she's been drinking a lot of water, she was hyper for a bit and IMHO her heart was racing a little a while ago.

A couple of hours later, she seems totally normal, but I have her wrapped in a towel and am playing doggy nurse [just in case.](http://i.imgur.com/t3hXXWa.jpg)

PTSD,"So I've been in the ER twice this year for suicide attempts. After the second attempt (happened like 1.5 months after the first), I was 5150'd and pretty much ordered to stop working and go on temporary disability. Before this I was a young professional working >40 hours/week and supporting myself in the Bay Area of CA.

The disability on its own only pays me about 65% of what I was making, but it's still enough to support myself, albeit in a smaller place. My dad really stepped up and helped me pay the last couple months rent left on my lease, and told me he wanted to meet with me and my doctors to see what he can do to help me.

My psychiatrist, social worker and PCP all agreed that I'm a danger to myself, I can't live alone, I can't work, and I just need to take time to RELAX and work my way back to normalcy. He heard all of this directly from my social worker who was relaying the other professional opinions as well as her own.

He said he wanted me to move in ""with him"" to make things even easier on me. I feel like it's worth  mentioning that my dad is very wealthy, comes from a wealthy family, and owns a condo  complex in wine country, which is where he had me move into a unit with my sister (hence the quotes earlier).

This is all fucking amazing, and I have felt like the most fortunate PTSD-sufferer in the world, and in just months I've already started looking into going back to school (I've been told pursuing a new career path would be wise, and have been proactive in communicating with schools and taking tours), I've been drinking far less, I have fewer nightmares, and I can actually sometimes be around groups of people without panicking.

Now, my dad has had some serious talks with me about getting a job again, and I keep reminding him that my doctors don't think I should work again until next year, but he keeps bringing it up. I have even told him that if he's uncomfortable with me living at his expense, I can afford to move, but at that point he always relents and says that's not what he wants and that he just wants me to start working again. This has happened maybe 3-4 times, and it's been very stressful, because I do feel guilty about not working, but at the same time I don't feel ready to go back yet, and medical professionals agree I need more time off. I remind him of this every time he starts berating me and it's like it goes in one ear and out the other.

So, about an hour ago, he comes to my place and in front of my boyfriend (visiting for Thanksgiving from hours away), tells me I owe him money, I am taking advantage of him, I am not allowed to have anyone over until I get a job, and that my boyfriend needs to get out.

I am at a loss right now. Since I started my disability, the only thing I have really needed help with was my last couple months' rent, which was very gracious of him to help with. But he never asked me to pay him back, and if he expected me to I wasn't aware of it (would have been happy to set up a plan or something). The rest of everything he's done for me he has insisted on doing even after I told him it wasn't necessary. Now he's acting like I forced myself on him and I'm some loser freeloader. I supported myself at 22 in my own apartment in one of the most expensive living areas in the United States! I had a full time job that I was good at and went to school for! I'm not some loser mooching off my family. My mind started deteriorating and I had to take time off to recover or be committed to a psych ward long term. He volunteered to help me in my time of need and I accepted his help. What the hell is with his sudden change in attitude? I felt like I was getting somewhere and it was all a big trick and I'm going to start unravelling again. I am already feeling some serious dp/dr setting in. And this is all happening right before Christmas, of course. What do I do?

My routine:  
* Avoid heat as much as possible. When your hair is long enough, you can just wrap it in a tight bun when you go to sleep and wake up with perfect waves. This is what I do every night, and curl or straighten only on special occasions (maybe once every few months - save maybe a piece of hair here and there that gets out of control).  
* *Trim* every four months. Tell your stylist you want to keep as much length as possible. Layers and such are fine, but if you want it to grow quickly, ask to get it ""tipped.""  
* Oil treatments every couple of weeks. Use warm, filtered oil. Saturate your hair just until it feels oily, up to the scalp. My favorites are avocado oil (this shit is INCREDIBLE), and coconut oil. Coconut is especially helpful if you have dandruff issues. Lather extra thoroughly with shampoo, and YES - still add conditioner. If ou don't think you cleansed all the oil, do another gentle shampoo lather after the first, but always condition afterwards.  
* Shampoo as little as possible. I shampoo once per week. I might shower and condition during the week, but shampooing is once per week, max.  
* Use as few products on your hair as possible, and the ones you DO use need to be organic and _(everything)_ free. I know there are arguments that certain chemicals don't matter, and that's fine and valid, but I still choose shampoos without it. Good shampoos to use are: Mane & Tail, Organix, Carol's Daughter, Avalon, Lush, etc. It's easy to find basic, organic products with research.  
* NO products besides dry shampoo (when necessary) and heat protector the few times heat touches your hair. Inevitably, these products will have silicone in them, which is extremely hard to rid your hair of (but better than heat damage), so use sparingly.  
* BIOTIN/""vitamin H."" This will help your skin and nails as well. 5,000 mcg is a safe start - start low, I've heard it can cause acne and oiliness in excess.  
* Your hair may be ""dead protein,"" but it's still part of you! Love it! I touch my hair all the time, massage my scalp when I shower, braid my hair when I sleep (REALLY helps with frizz), and dry it as gently as possible with a SHIRT, not terry cotton (towels).

There may be some other things I'm forgetting, but overall, this is the treatment my princess hair gets. I've done a ton of research into hair care on my free time (shout out to /r/haircarescience), and I *seem* to know what works! :)

PTSD,"[Original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3r6lre/my_23f_boyfriend_23m_has_sort_of_disappeared_and/)

I received a text from his friend saying they were in town (still hours away though) and that my boyfriend's fine. I pretty much lost it and told her he needs to call me ASAP to let me know he's okay, or his family and I were going to call the police.

So, he called me. He sounded annoyed and embarrassed of me, but I didn't care. I started screaming at him, probably loud enough for his friends to hear, asking about his whereabouts and audacity to leave his loved ones hanging. He told me he was in the middle of nowhere with no reception and that the calling card he was sharing with his friends ran out of minutes.

He did have the ability to go into town where he had reception, as he had done every couple of days early on, and he chose not to. He had no excuse for that.

I peppered in some more angry expletives and hung up on him. I have my share of emotional problems, but anger is rarely one of them. I got to that point though, and honestly I think it was justified.

His mother let me know that he came home and looks fine. He's safe and I've no need to panic anymore. Now I'm exhausted and not sure what I feel besides relief and deep resentment. He hasn't tried contacting me again yet, and if he does I don't know what he'll say or what my response should be.

I would be much obliged to read your thoughts on the matter. And thank you everyone for your support and talking me out of taking dangerous and stupid measures.

PTSD,"Together almost 2 years. We previously lived together for a year, but we both had to move back in with our parents due to financial issues. We live about 3 hours apart since the beginning of September.

Visiting has been no issue. I usually go to see him every two weeks for about a week-long visit. We talk constantly. Skype, phone calls, and texts every day. Overall, it does suck being apart, but we're very in love and happy together.

The last time I visited, he was supposed to come back with me to my place, but got an offer to trim with a good friend for ""someone"" at $200/day, so I told him go ahead, even though I didn't like the idea. There was no idea of ""how long.""

When he left, he didn't call me for two days. When he finally did, he told me he didn't know exactly where he was (just an idea - *""I'm like x miles away from x""*), who he was working for, when he was getting paid or when he was coming back. He sounded extremely tired and stressed out but said he was okay. He was only able to talk for about 5 minutes per call. He told me there was no service where he's working/sleeping (in a tent, apparently) but he would call me any time they went into town for ""supplies."" He was good about it for the first week, but I haven't heard from him in four days, and neither has his family.

He gave me a phone number for the ""person"" he's trimming for, just in case, but every time I call, an elderly deaf person answers the phone and I don't get anywhere. His and his friends' facebooks have been inactive since before they left. The whole situation was really shady to begin with and we're all getting pretty worried.

At what point are we okay for freaking out? When is it a good idea to call the cops?

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/3kce90/update_my_familiar_has_returned/

Hi everyone!

First of all I have to say *wooooooowwwwww.* My cat's behavior has made a complete ""180."" He is in the house all the time, he follows me, he gets along with my dog, he is happy and wants to snuggle constantly, even with my dog present...

I am blown away, and so is my family. They can't stop commenting on how amazing it is that our cat wants to be around the house. He's happy and playful, with his tail constantly up, and I'd say when he's not prancing around the house, he's either kitty-loafing in front of our house, or monitoring our large back-yard.

You guys... I was very skeptical at first for so many reasons. I usually question the paranormal, but I cannot deny the amazing ""coincidence"" that happened when I cast my first spell again.

I'm very excited to be back.",poop_dawg
PTSD,"And I'm starting to lose it. I lived with my boyfriend for over a year until a couple weeks ago. Due to financial circumstances on his part and mental instability on mine, we had to move back in with our parents, and his parents live four hours away.

The biggest source of my anxiety is PTSD from my last relationship. The timing of my current relationship was perfect IMO because I jumped into it a couple months after leaving my abusive ex. It was enough time for me to feel the relief of escaping before that faded and I had to deal with the emotional aftermath alone. My current boyfriend definitely had to adjust and learn some things, but overall he's been supportive, understanding, patient, and amazing. Any time I have a panic attack, he puts whatever he's doing down and tries to help me.

The best thing about having him around has been that he makes me feel safe. I like that when I wake up from my nightmares in the middle of the night, he's right there for me to latch onto, or when I start to feel scared of all the strangers in the grocery store, he'll put his arm around me and pull me in.

Well, now he's not here, and I'm starting to realize how much I depended on him to feel comfortable. Now, even on my medication, I feel so on edge and anxious all the time, and all I want is to be able to give him a hug but I can't.

I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how I might deal with this or substitute the comfort and safety I felt around him?",poop_dawg
PTSD,"[Original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/3jhyeb/how_to_i_reconnect_with_my_familiar/)

Hi everyone. So previously I was upset because the familiar from my past was very disconnected from me when I returned home after a long absence, so I tried some honestly *really weird* blood magick in a desperate and impatient attempt to win him over again.

Perhaps just coincidence - but a few days after the fact, I'm sitting here drinking wine, feeling horribly lonely and upset because my boyfriend is ignoring me, and in walks my beautiful cat. He meows to get my attention, then immediately jumped into my lap, purring, cuddling and drooling everywhere. I suddenly felt so much better.

Now, several minutes later, my kitty is relaxing happily off to the side, still purring, after my silly little dog got jealous and decided SHE needed my attention all the sudden. He's so wonderful and I hope this behavior continues! Regardless of the reason he decided to come to me, I'm feeling happy and successful.

And guess who just texted me? Said boyfriend. Hm.",poop_dawg
PTSD,"I listen to music for at *least* several hours a day, and I know it helps me, so I thought maybe we could share what we like with each other.

Here are some songs I like right now and why they relate to my PTSD:

[Human by Gabrielle Aplin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id_k_uNUud8) - Indie  
First of all, this woman's voice is hauntingly gorgeous - it has a very Celtic feeling (I am extremely fortunate that I've been told I sound like her when I sing!). She speaks a lot to self acceptance, and ""living for your mistakes,"" and that being ""human"" means having faults.

[Gloria by Morose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYSIYTJqlwI) - Black Metal  
If you can't tell, the lyrics in this song are *""How could you lie?""*. I feel like this entire song has kind of a ghostly, hindsight quality, where perhaps the victim would look back and ponder how they could have been tricked by a trusted someone.

**TRIGGER WARNING**  
[Love the Way You Lie by Eminem and Rihanna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U) - Pop/rap  
A frustrated, surprisingly accurately depiction of what domestic abuse is like. For when I need to remember my bad days and cry for a minute.

I want to hear what you guys listen to when you feel like you're stewing over some problems.

PTSD,"I've been separated from my black cat for years and for my entire history as a witch he's been my spiritual companion. When I moved away, he became borderline feral and did not connect closely with anyone else in my family (understandably).

I would have taken him with me but I was living in apartments and shitty areas as most 20-somethings do, and I chose his comfortability over mine. But now he's back in my life and I want his love and trust back. He's still sweet, but not loving, comfortable and empathic as he was previously.

The biggest issue is that I have a small, dorky dog now. She's great, and I love her so, so much, but she's not a familiar. She's just a ditsy, fun little dog, which is great for me right now (I have PTSD), but kind of interferes with getting back into practice. My cat will sit angrily around my dog for a while but will leave, annoyed, eventually. He doesn't understand what I went through when he was gone and I'm not sure how to ease into our connection again. He hasn't been as responsive as I'd hoped towards raw meat and grooming. He has been slightly forgiving, but it feels like we're just not clicking. I already have sleep issues but I feel like his tension towards me is making it more difficult to sleep. It's 8:30 a.m. here and I haven't slept since before noon yesterday.

I know it's a little extreme... but at this point I was thinking blood magick? Just one drop in his water bowl maybe, after I broke my vegetarianism to eat meat just once, so he might feel like I care and want to empathize/connect? My blood is perfectly clean - no STDs, drugs, or anything, and I'm very healthy diet-wise. Is that completely unreasonable? I'm going to eat a piece of meat anyway, just in case. If it doesn't go anywhere, then too bad for me.

I just want him to love me again regardless of anyone's or any animal's presence like before. I've only lived in the area for a few days, but I've been coming around quite frequently for the past few weeks and his lack of interest is concerning :/

Edit: forgot how disgusting meat is. Holy fuck. Hope my kitty is responsive.",poop_dawg
PTSD,"I don't know if this kind of post is allowed, but I thought it was kind of interesting.

I finally somewhat fixed the computer my abusive exboyfriend broke, and was able to go through old pictures of me from before I knew he even existed. The change in my appearance is shocking, I think. I thought it gave interesting insight on what sort of physical toll trauma can take on you. People used to compliment my appearance all the time, and now, when I actually see people, they just ask if I'm okay. I get why now. Not saying I don't still feel pretty sometimes... but I think you can tell a lot of the life has been sucked out of me.

The face-focused ones are both without make-up and in the same sort of lighting (almost unbelievable, I know). Also obviously I wasn't anticipating this so the comparisons are just the best I could do, they might be slightly off, but I think they give the general idea.

PTSD,"When I was in highschool I would say I was pretty ""popular."" I hung out with the metalheads, but I had connections to drugs and alcohol, places to hang out, and generally I think I was a fun, adventurous person to be around. I had my close group of friends, but I got along with everyone and partied with lots of people outside my social circle. I also managed to get good grades and have part time jobs on the side. I was happy.

I moved on and went to university and had the same experience. Made tons of friends, partied hard but kept up my grades.

I'd always had moderate issues with anxiety, but none of it was social, and the issues were largely manageable.

Then *he*  happened. He made me cut practically everyone out of my life, eventually that included my entire family as well. The only time I ever got to see anyone besides him was by sneaking out, and obviously I got caught a couple times, which lead to punishment.

It's been almost two years since I saw him for the last time and the idea of being around people still freaks me out. I can't remember time I saw my friends, though they still try to contact me (bless their hearts). I can't even go to the grocery store without getting antsy.

It's frustrating because I have had so much time to get over this, and I've been doing all the right things (therapy, meds, exercise, diet, work, etc), but I feel like I'm exactly where I was when I was with him. Maybe even worse than where I was, because now I have no reason to be scared so there's the shame that comes with that.

It's also frustrating that I used to know how to be social and now I've lost what I knew. It feels like I've forgotten how to speak a language.

Can anyone relate?",poop_dawg
PTSD,"I have very extreme PTSD - panic attacks/anxiety constantly, night terrors, psychosis, etc. It is so bad that I was practically forced by my doctors to go on disability. It came from a ""relationship"" where I was held against my will, raped and tortured constantly.

I don't function very well generally... Leaving my apartment makes me very anxious, I don't like crowds and I absolutely cannot be around angry people, or people in general really... At this point I'm only comfortable around my boyfriend and the family members I grew up with. I'm heavily medicated and working with multiple doctors to try to learn to function normally again.

My boyfriend's Nmom is a super girlie girl, total extrovert, religious, and extremely protective of her two boys. We both like hair and make up but that's all we have in common. I try *so* hard to get along with her, but I can't get anywhere. We got along initially but I guess my asocial (darker?) demeanor put her off. Now she tries to find any reason to complain about me to my SO and try to convince him to leave me. She has even talked to my parents and told them I'm no good for her son.

This seems to mostly (but not completely) stem from one particular incident. After I'd worked my manual labor job for 40+ hours one week, my SO wanted to visit home (4 hours away). No problem, usually. But by Saturday night during our visit, I had a psychotic break. Yay. Honestly not bad compared to most of the ones I've had, but it involved me trying to get in my jeep and escape their property, but I was stuck in mud, then I left my car and ran into the wilderness of their vast property and sat alone and cried for a couple hours. Completely, horribly sober, by the way.

I came back inside eventually and went straight to bed. She was already in bed, but busted into my room while I was alone and crying, and told me it was unbelievable how upset I was that her husband wasn't allowed to drink (???). Long story short - I told her my story and explained why I was so emotional. We spent the entire next day together making food and watching movies while my SO had quality time with his dad. She was so encouraging and supportive and I felt so close to her. I told her things in this vulnerable spell that I hadn't told my own mother or even my therapist. She told me she'd also been abused by a boyfriend in the past, and it was all very healing and helpful to me.

She ended up taking everything I told her and used it to fuel her argument as to why I was not good enough for my SO the next time they were alone. She told him I was unstable and crazy and a lost cause (I'd like to mention here really quick that I was working full time and supporting both of us, on my own in a 2 bedroom apartment in the bay area of California - boyfriend had been unemployed for a while). She tried to convince him to leave me, but he told her off quite brutally.

Since then I've seen her and we've faked nice... and my boyfriend and I are so happy together that I'm thinking this is going to be a long term thing... As long as his Nmom doesn't scare me off. I love the idea of being with him forever, but the thought of dealing with his mother has made me seriously consider breaking off the relationship.

He does stand up to her and defend me, or so he's told me, but she's a classic Nmatriarch and will not budge. He's told me there have been similar control issues in the past. We've only been together a year and a half and at this point I don't know how long I can stay while dealing with this. She's not overbearing in a roll-the-eyes type way. She manipulated me for an entire day to drag out very personal weaknesses and then used them against me. I just feel like I can't fucking deal with this anymore.",poop_dawg

PTSD,"Has anyone else gotten people inaccurately concluding that you have aspergers when you are under extreme stress? My personality is naturally stoic (I don't show pain easily, there's a lot of emotion under there (definitely a lot of empathy for others) but it doesn't naturally show unless I make a point of revealing it), logical and calm. I also don't always have that much interest naturally in social games, sugarcoating (and on occasion I dislike small talk) though I do put in the effort at these. I find that with the stress of PTSD a lot of my sugarcoating fell/falls by the wayside. I wasn't able to keep up as well with these things as well. I also started to feel a lot of shame and I largely stopped making eye contact with people. I knew it was unlike me and actually felt really embarrassed about that. (I would compare it to being depressed and unable to wash your hair and having people assume that you just don't know to wash your hair or don't know you should wash your hair when in fact you do know to wash your hair and in fact you feel very embarrassed about your unwashed hair and the fact that you just don't have the energy to wash it). 

Because I was grappling with this feeling of betrayal and hopelessness about ever connecting with people and not having them then betray me I also felt like I was at my wits' end with people. I don't know if I should say that I did not want to connect with people but I was definitely avoiding a lot of connection for fear of being betrayed again. I was not glossing over things like I normally did and was not adding all the social niceties and normal politeness because partly I was hurting so much that I didn't have the motivation to do that. 

This led some people  to assume that I had aspergers disorder, instead of seeing that I was really out of it with the PTSD. I was under so much stress and that's why I was acting that way meanwhile people were assuming that the effects of the stress were a natural characteristic of me instead of seeing them for what they were. I mean certain things I can do with my eyes closed, no matter how ill or stressed out I am because I am good at them (like logic and deep thinking), other things where I am not naturally talented at them, those things fall apart more easily when I'm under a lot of stress, in the same way that other people might find the first place their stress shows is with them failing courses for me it's harder to fake with people, negotiate interpersonal situations and get people to do what I want and that's one of the things to go. It doesn't help of course that I'm a woman and being more stoic/calm and logical as a woman is not expected (it is gender non conforming), so people I suppose find my gender non conformity in that sense a bit difficult to interpret and jump to the aspergers' conclusion. Has anyone felt the same ?

PS I think one way to tell the difference between people with aspergers and those with post traumatic stress is that people with aspergers seem a lot more agreeable. They generally seem to want to learn the right rules to follow and put great effort into following the rules whereas those with PTSD may not want to follow the rules because that means risking emotional connection and subsequent betrayal again.

PTSD,"Sometimes I feel like pressure to ""recover"" is making my post traumatic stress worse. I feel like people want me to go back to ""normal"" so that they can skip the step of acknowledging the depth of what I went through and skip the step of acknowledging my bravery in surviving. I don't begrudge people not wanting to deal with my post traumatic stress symptoms (for their own benefit and not my own) but I feel like they want my symptoms to go away so that they can deny what I've been through or just can't be bothered. They don't want to acknowledge the depth of what I've been through because it threatens them (they don't get to feel smug and better than me anymore). I feel like this pushes me to try to suppress and get rid of my feelings. Then I feel like I'm trying to avoid my feelings because I know that other people want to avoid them too and I feel like it's making it worse.

I know that true recovery would look like my bravery in surviving being acknowledged and celebrated even when I no longer have any symptoms. I know that even if I were to recover some people would not want to acknowledge my bravery in surviving, but they would be glad that I was ""functional"" because it's less of a problem for them. Then there would be some people who would acknowledge my bravery in surviving even though they ""didn't have to"". It's not getting rid of any symptoms for them or doing anything to improve their life, in fact it's costing them something to say that to me.

Then while I was being abused and was unable to extract myself from the abuse many people judged me as lazy or not trying hard enough. I had people slam doors in my face (literally). That hurt. During that time I was waking up in the morning feeling like putting a gun to my head and I would calm myself down by telling myself, ""This is just post traumatic stress... many people feel this way. It doesn't mean I should actually act on it, it's OK to have the feeling and not act on it."" Meanwhile people were treating me like I was lazy and slamming doors in my face. Then finally they figure out that they misjudged you and they want it go back to normal now and they will treat you like you are normal or something, but it still hurts. I don't know how to classify their sorry. I guess they figured out they evaluated wrong and that's good that they were at least able to get to that point. I paid all the cost of their misjudgement and they are content for me to have paid all the cost and to keep paying it. They are ""sorry"" but really it's no skin off of their back, I've been the one to incur all the losses, what did they incur and what does their sorry mean ? What sacrifices are they making and does it come anything close to the price that I've paid?

I've had severe PTSD for many years, it's gotten better to some extent for a few years. 99% of people have no empathy for what I'm going through and I get misjudged, blamed and rejected a lot. When I was doing better, more people were accepting. Some of them then wanted to be ""friends"" and pretend like everything was good, people who had never been there for me before. The question for me then was should I forgive people who were hurtful to me and unaccepting before.  Now unfortunately in spite of my very best efforts my PTSD has been reinvigorated again. A lot of people are now rejecting and judgemental again. It hurts. This is not something that I had or have control over. I tried so hard to not have this flare up again and now it has. I think I see some people's motivations more in this situation and I don't like what I am seeing. I am particularly heartbroken at being misjudged, people act like I'm trying to be like this or I just need some tough love or someone to set down the boundaries. Can't they see that I was attacked again and again and again ? Also people do not care about the years of my life that I've lost while I was struggling to hold it together and doing everything in my power to try to recover. To them it's just like, ""You're one of those people doesn't have family support and who takes longer to get things."" On the other hand someone else said to me a while ago, ""It's our loss that we've lost your contributions over these years that you've been unable to contribute"" and that was healing to me, I believed them and that was what I needed to hear to know that they really cared. 

The thing is that even if I did hypothetically get better again, and people start being ""nice"" again out of wanting my usefulness to them will I then blindly ""trust"" all these selfish people ? Will I then ""forgive"" them and forget about their motivations ? That would feel like a betrayal to myself, how will I deal with that ?

And this disrespect is not just something out in the ether somewhere, the contempt for survivors not having ""kept it together"" and stayed as ""sane"" as them is a continual drain because all day long I have to interact with people who look at me this way. I feel it and live with subtle but ever draining contempt from people every day. It's like how black people feel trying to explain racism to white people, and how women feel trying to explain sexism to men or how rich people have no idea what it is like to struggle financially.


Even if people ""say"" nothing, you feel the judgement in the way that they look at you, they always think that they deserve to have what they had, they worked hard for it (they worked harder than you is the assumption/implication). They refuse to acknowledge the added struggles that you had to bear. And it's always, ""Why didn't you just hold it together in stressful times and keep going the way that I did ?"" Meanwhile they don't understand the toll that shame takes and the toll that betrayal takes and they don't want to understand or see a need to understand that you had to grapple with so much more than them. In fact they find it threatening to their sense of accomplishment and pride. They need to have their pride that they were so much stronger than you to get their stuff and they feel diminished in acknowledging that they weren't that much stronger, they simply had things a lot easier. People will do anything to avoid giving this ounce of dignity and human respect to a survivor of abuse. And it hurts being treated this way. It takes a toll. You go through the abuse, and then when you get through it you have to live with a society that has contempt for you as a survivor.


I honestly have no problem trying to keep it together and acting like I have it together even when I feel awful or when I feel like I'm not together, but the continual diminishment of the courage and disparagement hard work that it takes for me to do this takes a toll. You feel people's contempt for your hard work. They look at it and it doesn't matter to them, it doesn't exist or they want to make it not exist. But it is hard to keep putting in that level of hard work, it's hard to keep having that motivation with people's diminishment and disparagement of my hard work. It is crazy making because society is constantly sending you the message that, ""No it is not that hard, it's as easy for you as everyone else."" What do you do with your feelings about how much you are struggling through and how much hard work you are putting in when society resolutely and determinedly denies how hard it is for you? When people give you that message it makes you hate yourself. It makes you hate your feelings, it makes you hate your feelings of how hard it is for you. It is incredibly disparaging to you there who are swimming frantically and struggling so hard just to stay afloat. It drains your motivation to try. It shames you, it makes you think that your feelings of exhaustion are wrong and something to be ashamed of. It adds to your burden of making you feel that something is wrong with you for hurting this way and finding it so hard. The continual contempt from people and minimization of the immense hard work we put in just to survive takes a toll and makes it impossible to keep your spirits and motivation up to keep putting in that level of work. Then of course if my motivation falters because society is telling me my hard work doesn't exist, then I'm to blame for not ""keeping it together."" During all of this people continued to enable my father to harass me and enable his abuse. 


The time in my life when I was the most mentally healthy and was the most together was when I had a friend who had been a similar victim of child abuse to me as a child and had experienced the same level of rejection and betrayal from her parents. I am immensely grateful for having had her. I believe that I would not have graduated high school and my life would be in a much worse situation if I hadn't had her. The thing that she gave me was genuine understanding and empathy and she did not scorn me or subtly minimize the abuse like everyone else did. She actually understood and said that it was wrong. For non survivors as a nice starting place it would be great if people would at least admit that they have no idea how degrading child abuse is. They just have no idea. People always think they have some idea, no it's about a 1000 times worse than you think it is. Just start there by admitting that you truly don't know and can't wrap your mind around it. 


The only people who truly understand how much work I'm putting in and who recognize my courage in getting  through this on any level are other survivors of child abuse. They are the only people who don't disparage my hard work and actually have respect for other survivors and the strength it took to get us through.

PTSD,"This perspective so infuriating and disgusting. I've had numerous people try to deny my trauma and my strength in surviving things. I get my strength diminished from the, ""I want to take credit for all my accomplishments and feel that I'm amazing and better than everyone else. Admitting that I had it easier than you not having to go through trauma will diminish my self satisfaction,"" crowd and then the people who haven't accomplished as much want to say, ""Your trauma doesn't count because it wasn't as bad as mine so it wasn't real abuse.""

PTSD,"I'm having a very long week. I've been feeling so much shame. I was getting so (a mixture of) angry and ashamed last week and that I could not sleep. I am disappointed in a lot of people. Everyone seems to be requiring so much of me. People are making empty promises to me and trying to manipulate me and it is so hurtful. I feel more and more ashamed. I guess that these people are not fair. And then they try to help and they get frustrated that their help wasn't enough and blame me. I also opened up to someone about my trauma, initially she was supportive but then she decided that it was too much for her and disappeared. I am really hurt. I feel like I can't win or do OK at this no matter what I do. I've been attacked repeatedly for talking about my trauma by so many people. People just get so angry when I talk about it, my family hates it since it was family violence. Other people look disgusted and get upset. 

I am trying my absolute best and have been trying for a long time. No one sees how hard I am trying, they just label me as lazy. I feel so hurt and shamed by it. I am so so tired of people blaming me no matter what. I tried desperately every way possible to deal with my trauma when it blew up, counsellors just added to the burden and everyone judged me for it. Now everyone is further judgemental and shaming. I am tired of being given the short end of the stick and people always assuming that I can do things that I can't. It's deeply hurtful. I am very very frustrated with people. They don't put other people through what I am put through. It really hurts that I am then judged as lazy. ",lovinglily
PTSD,I'm having a lot of trouble with insomnia. At night when I try to go to bed I feel very angry. My jaw clenches and I can't relax. I don't know what I am so angry about. It's difficult because I don't even know where this emotion is coming from. My adrenaline literally seems to be turned all the way up. I don't really have a visual or in other way sensorial flashback as far as I can tell. Around 2 or 3 am I finally fall asleep after laying there in bed livid for a couple of hours. I sleep three hours (never more than five) and then wake up the next day. ,lovinglily
PTSD,"I was friends with someone who was very supportive and caring, she would listen to me and help me out with things on numerous occasions. However the one thing that she could not let me do was be sad. She always had to cheer me up and to tell me to look on the bright side. I cared about her (and her opinion of me) a great deal, to the point where I felt uncomfortable being sad in front of her and sometimes she would notice when I was sad and force me out of it. I had this fear that if I was truly sad I would lose her friendship. In the end I did because she absolutely did not understand me asking her to not ""cheer me up"" all the time. I really felt embarrassed with her.

Another thing I grapple with is the need to put on a positive face for people and say that I think things are going OK and are going to work out. I have NO idea whether things are going to work out and yes I seem to need to keep reassuring people that they will work out. And actually having to be ""positive"" with people all the time that I'm hopeful makes me feel even more anxious that things are not going to work out. It makes me feel ashamed and terrified to feel my feelings. It adds a lot of anxiety over feeling the way that I do. I hesitate to feel through things. 

I know that this is a social convention to a large extent and it's something that people say to gloss over other people's feelings. I sense that they aren't good with sadness or tragedy and I fear being rejected by them. It made me feel anxious and ashamed of my trauma because I felt that their acceptance was conditional. I was afraid that if I felt the way I felt and if they knew, they would not be able to handle it and want me as a friend because they are so uncomfortable with sadness. I definitely don't feel like this with everyone, but there are few people who understand the things that I have been through and are comfortable with it, who I don't feel ashamed with. Has anyone else had a similar experience with friends ? What are your thoughts on this ?

PTSD,"How do you explain your parents to people ? I find it is hard, since I have been a child my father has been humiliating me publicly. In church he would scream at me publicly in front of everyone else or start beating me to show how bad a person I was. As I got to be a teenager and this became not quite kosher the same way (though he still did it at home behind closed doors, coming up and physically fighting with me and hitting me) he then would tell everyone that he was having ""problems"" with me and manipulate people into coming over to pray for me and talk to me (i.e. bully me). I went to university far away from him and he was sending people to email me, phone me and visit me. As a child he used to tell me this story about this ""bad"" man who never listened to his mother and when he grew up he was ""bad"" so he went to jail and when he went to jail his mother came to visit him and he said, ""Mom I want to tell you a secret"" his mother leaned in to hear him and he bit off her ear. He would say that to tell me he was ""afraid that I was heading down that road."" I felt awful and hopeless after hearing that.  The most difficult thing about what he did was sometimes not the actual acts of doing it, it was the constant and ever present humiliation which I had no control over. No matter how much I tried to please him I would still be humiliated either way. 

My father does this with other people too, he puts them on the spot and uses shame as a method to control them but being his daughter I get the worst of it. 

People do not understand why I just can't brush it off and get on with my life. I've been reading about shame (humiliation is shaming) and the toll that shame takes on people. Most recently I was reading Brene Brown on this in Daring Greatly. Has anyone else read this ? I also read a study about how this psychologist once found a way to predict divorce within 10 years with 90% accuracy in couples. If he found one partner scorning and shaming the other when they talked about a difficult topic, the relationship predictably could not survive the constant humiliation. People just don't have the capacity to stay in a situation where their dignity and sense of self is being assaulted like this and maintain their mental health. They have to get out in order to preserve their health. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I feel like I'm isolating myself from people because at the moment I can't set boundaries as well as I want to be able to. I don't feel good about myself and so I feel like it's very hard for me to set boundaries with people. I feel like I set boundaries almost in retrospect, like I will come back a day or a week later and say, ""That was not OK. I was not OK with that, please don't do that again"" and I notice that other people (and when I'm feeling good I too) can set boundaries almost more intuitively and almost effortlessly and not for big things, and a day or two after it happens but almost like I feel free to express hesitancy or reluctance when something small doesn't make me feel right. Setting boundaries at a later date (over bigger things) almost ensures that there are more hurt feelings and it causes more of a disruption.

It's hard to explain, it's like when I am feeling good I almost do it subconsciously, in a way that when I am feeling ashamed even if I were putting all my effort into it, I wouldn't be able to do it automatically and I wouldn't notice and sense things quickly enough to do it. It takes so much energy and sorrow to be setting boundaries in this state of mind and setting them at the point where I'm able to do so almost after the fact is inclined to cause more friction and take more energy as well.

PTSD,"From now on I'm repledging to just do my best for myself. I'm not killing myself about bending over backwards to make situations turn out OK or to make people like me if they have a misconception about me. I'm just going to do my best and if that isn't good enough, maybe things fall apart or never get put back together but I'm going to be OK with myself. I'm not going to get down on myself for not being better or superhuman.

I think that a lot of the time when people go through trauma we are made to feel like we have to be superhuman in response to it, because a normal human response of being broken or traumatized isn't good enough for many people and you might lose jobs and other aspects of your life if you just have a normal response. There is a due date for recovery and an expectation that you will get over it and survivors/victims wonder if they will indeed have the strength and ability to get over it by that date or if they will have the ability to control their sadness/anger/shame resulting from the trauma enough to be polite and likeable. Has anyone else noticed this or had the same experience ?

In my experience sometimes your best is enough and sometimes it isn't enough and you do lose out when your best isn't good enough and superhuman strength was required. (At least this has been my experience and this is how I now view the world, that sometimes your best isn't good enough and things will still fall apart, but you still have to try anyway). In those sorts of situations when your best isn't good enough to keep the job or friends etc or you are afraid that it might not be, it's so easy in those situations to put pressure on yourself to do better than your best and be superhuman. For me it's really hard when I am terrified that my best won't be enough to hold the situation together (and all hell may break lose because my best isn't good enough) to still love myself and be OK with my best regardless but I am deciding to be OK with my best.

This has happened before and I tried so hard not to let it happen again but in spite of my best efforts it did and everyone let it happen so now I just feel very ashamed that it is happening again and that I'm in the same place with this happening to me again. I feel an incredible amount of shame that this has happened to me before and now it is happening to me again, like this means there is something deeply wrong with ME that this is happening more than once and it's my fault for not stopping it from happening again. I feel like it must be something about me that I deserve for this to happen to me that this keeps happening to me. I feel like I have a sense of denial about it that ""This is not happening."" I don't particularly sad about what is happening to me because in a way I feel like I deserve it or I am sort of dissociated from it or something. I feel like I deserve to be going through all of this pain, it's not bad that it's happening because it's happening to a really awful person who deserves it. I don't feel sad about what's happening to be me because I don't feel like I deserve any better. It's happened before and is happening again because I'm an awful person. And no one cared to help before and no one cares to help now either and no matter how hard I work to get out this will always keep happening to me (partly thanks to my parents) because this is all I deserve and all that I'm good for pain. I'm the one that the ""bad things happen to"" and are allowed to happen to. I'm the one whose suffering everyone writes off as if I'm deserving of the worst things while other people are actually helped to not end up in my situation. I feel a very deep sense of hopelessness because this has happened before and every time it keeps happening I feel like a worse person who really doesn't deserve to have anything. I don't even feel like killing myself because I feel like however much pain I'm in it I don't care to kill myself because the pain I am in doesn't count anyway, I'm not worth not suffering.

PTSD,"I've been noticing in myself a tendency to avoid people when I feel they are getting too close to me. As soon as someone seems nice it feels like I have a flashback of my mother that they are unexpectedly going to turn on me and claw me to pieces. 
I am terrified of getting into relationships after the relationship I had with my parents growing up. My experience of a relationship is that the person's claws come out unexpectedly without the slightest notice over and over and that is how the relationship goes. 

At the same time I feel like I am traumatically bonded to my parents and I can't seem to lead an independent life and I can't process everything that happened with them. When they seem the slightest bit nice (they can be very charming) I feel like my heart yearns for that love that I missed out on and I just want to believe at all costs that this is love and they do care. I can't seem to put the two pictures of them together the charm and the pain, and yet the pain comes out in flashbacks with strangers and other people.

This is the oddest thing to me because this is exactly the opposite of my reaction with other people where when they seem the littlest bit nice I panic and expect the claws to come out next (which I have little evidence for). But with my parents even though I have ample evidence that this phenomenon of the claws coming out will in fact happen, I don't feel the flashbacks this way. I almost like fawn. I don't know if this is a flashback response itself. It's completely senseless.  ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I have been abused by many people but the thing that makes me feel most awful is how my parents treated me and continue to treat me. I watch other people's parents treat them with respect and care and I can't get past the fact or bend the reality that my parents just didn't, don't care and never will care. No matter what I do, what I manage to accomplish or how hard I work in life I will never be able to get this. My parents will never see me as worthy of respect and love and care. I feel very ashamed and I feel like it is something that I can never quite get over. My parents were involved in religious leadership and almost my entire social world of people growing up looked up to my parents and would not acknowledge the abuse which further shamed me. I felt like I was a lesser form of being (like a dog) that you could treat badly (for a human) but that was OK it did not count as abuse. My parents just do not care. I feel like a second class citizen in the world like I will never have that sense of being quite good enough which is the thing that it seems sometimes I wish for the most. It's almost the way some people describe being black, no matter how hard you work or how high you climb or what you accomplish you will always just be a black person and that's all you will ever be to a lot of people. I feel the same that that's all I will be a second class citizen and regarded as that by some people and there's nothing I can do about it. The only thing that helps is knowing that there were a lot of other people who went through the same thing and also had/have parents who violated their trust and did not care.

Maybe this is depressing to talk about feeling this way and wanting that feeling of being loved and feeling assured that you are indeed worth just as much as anyone else and good like all the rest of the humans but for me whether I talk about it or not the pain is always there, it's always in the background anyway.

PTSD,"This is beyond heartbreaking knowing that PTSD sufferers/trauma survivors are killing themselves. I am really upset about LivingInFearPTSD girl posting that she is killing herself. I hope she isn't dead but it looks like she is dead. I don't think I can go through another person on here killing themselves. Please don't anyone else on here kill themselves! I have been feeling just numb for the past couple of days (I couldn't/can't even feel sad) because she was pretty clear from some of her posts that that was her intention. I was having suicidal thoughts tonight in response so this. 

I was trying to tell her not to kill herself that a lot of us feel the same shame but it didn't work. We all fighting a very hard battle and struggling to survive ourselves and it is hard knowing that someone like us has died from it. Her posts over the last couple of days have really taken a toll on my mental health. It is a shame that society did not take her trauma more seriously and help her or prevent it from hapening. We all need to work to change the things in society like abusers/sexual abusers who are causing this PTSD that is killing people. 

I've personally taken steps to try to inform a mother and protect girls that were in the situation this poster was in from abuse. It's chilling to know that those kids could have ended up dead like this from their stepfather's abuse if I hadn't done that (and actually I don't necessarily know that I was able to protect them, they may have been abused and could still end up dead). I've been wishing I could take some MDMA after this incident (but at the same time I kind of don't want to get high because all my own trauma is going to come up on it and I can't deal with that right now) also I don't have any MDMA and I don't want to take it.

PTSD,"Lately I have been thinking about dignity and respect as survivors of trauma. This might seem like an odd post for this subreddit but I feel like it might not only be applicable to us here and but also extra applicable to us since many of our traumas (if they were interpersonal traumas such as rape, child abuse, or being trapped in a traumatic situation to further someone else's ends) were basically caused by people such as the person who attacked us not respecting us. 

I feel that this is also an important question and consideration since sometimes when you have an illness and especially one that affects you emotionally other people easily ""lose"" respect for you, particularly if they don't understand what you are going through. I think that this is one painful aspect of PTSD, watching other people who respected us before lose respect for us as a result of the PTSD symptoms. All our strength and hard work in living each day and putting out best foot forward in a challenging situation can easily go unseen except by the people who respect us. We can be compared to people who are not struggling with PTSD and all the hard work we are doing just to deal with our pain is invisible and can become discounted especially by people who want to believe that the world is a fair place and that it is a meritocracy (to some extent because they want to take credit for their success and where their hard work got them). It's easy to lose our sense of dignity when struggling with PTSD. 

I would like to hear your thoughts on this. What does respect mean to you ? Who has had respect for you and how have they shown it ? How can you tell when a person respects you ? What does a person who respects you say or do ? Can you give some examples ? What are your thoughts on respect ? Thank you in advance for any replies.

A couple years ago I was listening to a fun talk and I was off in my mind and then the woman giving the talk noticed that I wasn't there and stared at me very pointedly and determinedly as if to say, ""Come back here.""

Somehow I was thinking that this was going to be a great program but I didn't feel completely comfortable in the interview. A few of the things that the interviewer said and did set me on edge. For one thing I arrived late for my interview and I said, ""I'm so sorry about that."" After my telling her that I was a bit out of it because of the family difficulty the night before, the interviewer then turned it around to say, ""Well you were taking care of yourself good for you for coming late."" That really seemed ridiculous to me and made me feel really uncomfortable. Why are you congratulating me for being irresponsible and incompetent and coming late ? I didn't choose to come late it only happened because I was so depressed and sad and it's something that needs to be changed not celebrated. Edited to add (I've been feeling suicidal since talking to her yesterday.)


Then concerning some sexual harassment I had faced, she asked me how I had ""retaliated.""
The whole thing felt a bit uncomfortable because I felt like my feelings were wrong about what I had been through, like she was getting me to be more sad than I actually am and I was feeling like my feelings were wrong and that she knew my feelings better than I did. It felt like she had too much control in the interaction and I had too little. Logically the program looks good and I agree with it philosophically and everything but in terms of how it feels to me it in some ways it felt wrong. Usually I go with how I feel logically rather than my gut sense but that has not worked out well on a few occasions. I'm disappointed since I was looking forward to this and thinking that this would be good.

Other counsellors I have seen have refused to acknowledge that he did anything wrong which of course left me unable to trust them. 

It's getting to the point for me where I have almost given up seeking help. I am so demoralized. I feel awful. I notice that I have a very proactive approach towards my physical healthcare. I feel that physically taking care of myself is my responsibility and even if the doctor gives me the wrong advice about taking care of my body, I need to look out for myself and take responsibility because it will be me living with whatever consequences not the doctor. 

But in regard to my mental healthcare, it feels like I have learned helplessness. It is so hard to access help that it feels frustrating and out of my reach. It feels like my mental health is something that is not entirely in my control to take care of. It seems like I get and loose good mental healthcare arbitrarily and that it's something other people have control over rather than me. It's demoralizing to not have the tools and help I need to stay mentally healthy within reach. I feel like I can't take care of myself and good mental health is outside of my reach. I don't feel competent about taking care of myself mentally or proactive about my mental health but at the same time I can see that if I faced the obstacles in regard to my physical health that I do in regard to my mental health I would likely be extremely demoralized and may have given up on that too at this point rather than having the attitude that things are within my hands.

I feel like mental health is something that just happens to me, that other people do to me which is outside of my control and if other people are just nice enough love can fix my problems. I feel that I have come to be quite unproactive about my mental health. Does anyone else feel the same ?

This is so different however from how I relate to my physical health which I am very proactive about. I feel that my body is mine and I am in a way alone with it if it is diseased, no one can save me from myself so I need to take care of myself. I'm the one that is going to suffer if I don't take care of my physical body not other people, not the doctors. I feel that it is my responsibility to take care of my physical body. 

But with my mental health I find it hard to see it this way. Maybe I have just been attacked too many times so I've given up hope that I can keep myself safe and healthy mentally.

I mean I don't really understand but having those feelings was really really upsetting. I felt like I was losing my mind particularly with the waking up and being half asleep and not remembering. Among other things I ended up self medicating (which was not a good choice), I don't know why I just didn't tell the doctor and focus on pursuing seeing a neurologist like crossed my mind, I just thought I was incredibly depressed and stressed out and on the verge of losing my mind and it was from that. It was awful feeling like I was stressed out to that degree. 

To some extent I don't understand why the other symptoms in particular the deja vu and feeling like my jaw was huge were so upsetting. But I feel a sense of relief at someone getting it. Have you had similar experiences ?",lovinglily
PTSD,"How do you all deal with the effects of your PTSD symptoms on those around you/those you care about ? And how do you deal with the effects on your own self esteem ? 

I realize that rationally dealing with my PTSD symptoms is like dealing with someone who can't stop throwing up. They throw up where ever you go with them, and all over the building at work and on your nice rug and they throw up on the floor and you have to clean it up and you have to make sure you're not in your nice clothes around them. 

I hate that I'm the one throwing up on the floor and getting it dirty for other people AND of course I feel absolutely 100x more awful from throwing up all the time in the first place and wish I could be well so much :( Knowing that you are getting someone's floor dirty doesn't help with the shame of PTSD either. I am really fed up of having this, I want this to end. Sometimes I feel suicidal.

I was getting counselling for things but then I tried to be open with someone else about what I was confronting and he just didn't believe me or want to help. I felt like he saw me as a liar. The shame since then has been overwhelming (and I stopped getting counselling and have been afraid to go back because the world just can't deal with this) and I've kind of given up hope that people can understand me. I've also felt a lot of anger towards people for not believing or helping me. I just feel so ashamed and I feel that people won't believe me, I can't bear to be with my friends and I feel alienated from them.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Does anyone feel helpless ? I feel helpless. I've been trying to fix whatever is going on with me for 4 years and despite what I try it always seems nothing seems helpful. A lot of family members have said that they don't believe me and I feel like every time I try to help myself I get cut down by someone who doesn't care, people are not only not helping but actively cutting me down and telling me I'm wrong/lying. I feel like I just can't handle it. I can't handle being cut down anymore. I don't think I can trust anyone again.

I know a lot of people have tried to be helpful but I can't explain to them that it's hard to not just crumble in shame and not be able to get up off the floor or accept their help in any way when you have multiple people calling you a liar and trying to shame you. I feel like people can't understand that how difficult it is to deal with the shame and how much it makes me hate myself and completely paralyzes me. People think that other people shaming me and not believing me is no big deal but it really hurts. I feel like people blame me instead for being lazy.

I do feel like I have to take responsibility for my life though and know that my life is my responsibility to direct. I just feel so frustrated and helpless though. 

I do really feel that I have to take responsibility for my life though. If I don't fix things I will suffer. I just don't want to be blamed for it though. I am also just finding it so hard to have to motivation to work hard on fixing my life. I know that I need to work hard but I just can't seem to find that drive to do it within myself anymore.",lovinglily

This article is titled: ""Trailblazing the continent on foot, raising awareness of child sex abuse""
Some excerpts: CBeebies actor Matthew McVarish, himself the victim of an abusive uncle, is taking a 16,000km trek to raise awareness of the problem
A star of the BBC children’s programme ‘Me Too!’, McVarish also works as the European ambassador for the non-profit organisation Stop the Silence: Stop Child Sexual Abuse. He said he views his trip around Europe as one of the responsibilities of the position.
McVarish pointed out, however, that his intentions weren’t to drag out the past for him or for anyone he meets on the road. Instead, he hopes to help prevent cases of abuse in the future by encouraging victims to speak up.
“I’ve spoken to thousands of survivors on my walk, and I ask them if they’ve ever talked to the police. Many say that they don’t feel strong enough to stand in the same courtroom as the person who abused them,” he said.
“I completely understand that, because it’s very difficult,” he went on. “But I ask them: ‘Do you think you’re stronger as an adult than the child that same person might abuse tonight, or tomorrow, or next week?’ It’s not about seeking revenge or compensation, it’s about child protection right now.”
Stopping the silence
In each city he visits, McVarish meets with public officials to encourage policy change, particularly in regards to the respective country’s statute of limitations for reporting cases of child sex abuse. While no statute exists in McVarish’s home country, it is currently set at ten years in Denmark and varies throughout Europe.
“There will always be cases just outside of the bracket, no matter the amount of time,” McVarish said. “And the person who abused them could still be out walking the streets.”
But the main focus of his walk, McVarish pointed out, is to facilitate open discussions about abuse in communities where the topic is seldom addressed.
“There are an estimated 100 million abuse survivors in Europe, many of them in rural areas. So for their local paper to have a guy on the front page talking about sex abuse not as a scandal, but just trying to deal with it, can be very valuable.”

I just don't understand how she can do this to the most vulnerable of the vulnerable, victims of child abuse by someone in their families. It is so upsetting to hear about her testifying in these cases to keep child sexual abusers from facing prosecution and justice. It is sad. 

I also don't understand how someone that calls them a researcher/scientist can get themselves involved in such a political and legal issue and be working as an expert consultant getting paid to testify in court. I mean researchers are supposed to be impartial but to base your whole career around one point of view, means that you start wanting only results that confirm that. I feel like she is targeting child sexual abuse victims in particular. 

I also don't understand why she seems to be mainly applying her ""false memory"" ideas to just incest victims. You would think that false memory could apply to many situations across the board not just to one issue.

PTSD,"I have gone through some very difficult things with my fundamentalist religious parents. For a long time I have felt like the things that they do violate my sense of morality/conscience. See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1muroe/dealing_with_traumatic_events_how_to_deal_kind_of/) for an example. I feel like I cannot take the pain of how they treat me and also how they treat other people anymore. I am considering ending things with them but it is difficult for me. I care about them to some extent as well, and I am also terrified of society's opprobrium/anger disapproval towards anyone who would make a break with family. I am an INTP. I wanted to ask some NFs their thoughts on this because I am inclined to want to do non traditional things and ""innovate"" being an N. I don't understand why I should have to follow social convention and stay close to my family no matter what, logically it makes no sense and seems ridiculous, but then being an INTP I'm not terribly aware of and good at managing feelings. I'm not good at budgeting for my and others emotional needs. I've had my bf tell me it's not a good idea to leave and it's really hard not to listen to him. A few counsellors I talked to were not in favour of me leaving even though the relationship is bad and hurting me because they thought that I was, ""too upset about it, it seems kind of like you want to leave but you don't."" One counsellor thought it was a good idea. It was hard for me to know whether these counsellors were uncomfortable with the idea because of tradition and ""family above all else"" which it seems most people in our society adhere to or something else. 

So I wanted to ask some NFs your thoughts, because I figure you all are likely to have a better grip on feelings than me and also to not be locked into tradition at all costs. Have any of you ever done this or watched any of your friends do this ? How did you feel about it ?

Edit: I want to ask this, I feel that I can do a sort of logical costs benefits analysis about leaving my family versus staying but emotionally it's hard for me to have a sense of it, it's hard for me to size it up in an emotionally engaged way. It's hard for me to feel the situation as a whole. I can feel parts of it, like the benefits and then the costs of it but I can't feel it all together. How does this feel to you all who have decided to leave emotionally ?",lovinglily
PTSD,"I can handle J types neatness and organization etc. I notice I find it hard to deal with their certainty about things. I often find it comes across as either arrogant and overly certain. I often feel like J types get my back up against a wall and I feel cornered and stubborn. Also their ways of communicating/advocating their points don't appeal to me. The more certain they get about the point that they are making and that they are right, the more resistant I feel to what they are saying. Does anyone else feel the same ? It's a lot easier for someone to get me to listen if they appeal to uncertainty, and say, ""Well I can't be certain that you are right."" I find that of course quite intriguing/interesting.",lovinglily
PTSD,"Firstly let me say, this is difficult to deal with the following as an INTP because I'm not good at sensing and talking about my feelings. The INTP drive for knowledge and, ""If I find out enough I'll be competent and I just need to learn everything to deal with this. The more upset I get the more knowledge I try to gather"" means that I just read more and more upsetting statistics and upsetting stories, and not being super in tune with feelings I just process things rationally and I don't even have a great grasp on how much my continuing delving into this is upsetting me. Not to mention the INTP ""The truth is what matters I have to find out the truth"" and paying attention to logic and making decisions by logic rather than taking feelings (my feelings) into consideration. 

I'm 29, I was sexually abused by a guy in my church when I was 7 and a couple years ago the same man married a woman with children from a previous marriage. My parents fucking knew what happened with me (I told them when I was 7 because the whole ""Keeping a secret thing seemed illogical/pretentious/grated on my truthful ""I hate pretending"" logical self"") and said nothing/did nothing to intervene. A bunch of people knew and did nothing. 

It was basically hell for me to try to get anyone to listen and get those kids away from him. People's attitudes (including numerous counsellors (more like 7 of them) I have been to, YES I have talked to a counsellor about this, but they are mostly F types which I will get to in a minute) and apathy towards this issue is just unbelievable. Everyone is all ""Oh I'm against child abuse"" but when it happens no one wants to lift a finger to help. 

As an INTP I have a low tolerance for fakeness and the fakeness upsets me. I really don't ""get"" it about the Fs just being ""nice"" and saying things that they don't believe in to make everyone ""feel nice."" And I don't get it about the S types just not wanting to rock the boat and just go along with things as they've always been done, you know we want to be conventional, and I've never seen someone talk about sexual abuse before or take steps to deal with it and I don't want to be the first. I don't understand why people can't just do the right thing. 



It really irritates me that this is all about being socially/politically correct to most people and there's no ""truth"" in it and conviction about the truth in it, and everyone is so fake competent at dealing with it. Everyone knows exactly which boxes to tick off and all the right fake words to say to convince everyone they are politically correct. It's all just a fucking social game to people. 


I wish every person that says they ""CARE"" about this but doesn't would just get rid of themselves honestly. ~7 counsellors heard about this from me, they are legally obligated to report it but none of them did. They all told ""me"" to report it. I eventually did report it to a hotline even though I am the person who suffered through this myself and for whom it is hardest to talk about this and expose myself. The kids are now away from this man, apparently the mother finally listened (and my parents finally spoke up) and left him. It's not just the perpetrators who cause this to continue to happen it's the people who say, ""oh I'm a good person. I would stand up against that"" and then do nothing and want to protect perpetrators. I wish not only the perpetrators but those fake people who say they care but they don't were in hell where they were having to relive the abuse they put other people through every single day until they figure it the fuck out that it's wrong and stop with the fakeness.

Dealing with a situation like this is clearly not my strong suit (?) or area of competence at all. 

Edit:  ~7 counsellors heard about this from me, they are legally obligated to report it but NONE of them did. Why did you sign up to be a counsellor and agree to report things like this and what the fuck did they teach you in psychology/counselling school if it makes you too uncomfortable to deal with stuff like this ? They are there to make money, play peekabo with people and do nothing productive whatsoever.

I wasn't completely clear, the kids are away from this man. But it just feels like a very tiny victory knowing that I was basically the *only* person in the situation who gave a fuck about stopping it. ",lovinglily
PTSD,"I was sexually abused by a guy in my church when I was 7 years old. I was ""OK"" (holding it together mentally but barely) until about 4 years ago when my best friend attacked me about the childhood sexual abuse and basically said it was my fault. I lost my mind and began having PTSD symptoms and just stopped giving a f%*&. I was incidentally seeing a therapist at the time and I brought up the childhood sexual abuse with him but he didn't want to talk about it/help me with it.



As if that wasn't enough the abuser contacted me shortly afterwards trying to add me on Facebook. Then I learned that he had married a woman from my (former) church who had little children from her marriage before. My fundamentalist Christian parents who knew what he did to me, did nothing to try and help/remove this kids and that really broke my heart (they knew even before me that this predator was marrying this woman with children and they didn't care to do anything).
I told everyone in the church and my entire extended family about the abuse and that this man was kids to try to protect them almost even though I didn't want to expose myself. It was like PTSD flashbacks to feel that this was happening to another kid again.



Personally I don't know how far I would have gone in reporting this man and exposing everything to the light. I have horrible feelings about speaking up, I felt (/feel) quite ashamed and went far beyond what I was comfortable with trying to report this stuff. I did it partly because after the PTSD blew up I just stopped giving a f%&*, I want social support but I just don't have the motivation. I feel disconnected from people since this whole thing, after seeing the level of apathy and just lack of care in people (including my parents not having ever reported the man to the police for what he did to me or taking action to help these kids) and after my best friend's attacking me and saying it was my fault. I just don't care, I don't care to do all the social niceties and be polite and generally fit in in society. I don't feel like being careful to only show people my cute face and follow the rules and hide my ugly spots, I find I just honestly don't care. I wish I could care but I just don't. I don't want to sit down and be cute and get people's approval anymore, it just doesn't mean that much to me as hard as I try for it to mean something it just doesn't.



Many people have said they care but it's always followed up with more nonsense like not taking action to protect those children. (Their mother did remove them from the man after I told so many people in my parents church that it shamed the mother, grandmother and my parents into action). Everyone (especially in the counselling/psychology profession) keeps making these wacky statements about how my friend didn't mean what she said and tries to excuse my parents and everyone. It feels like a trauma just to be alive, I don't want to live on this planet with people.



I don't give a f&%*. I can't remember feeling this apathetic at any point in my life before. I feel that I can't trust in people anymore. I just don't care to make any sort of working relationship with anyone work. I'm not pushing anyone away (people are jerks enough as it is) but I'm not editing myself or making myself approvable either. I feel like with friends like my best friend and parents and church, why even bother ? With friends like that who needs enemies ? I'm not doing anything horrible to people but I don't feel like I'll ever have a real honest connection with anyone anymore.



Whether people can understand the situation you are in and be on your side just seems so arbitrary. It's like if they can mentally understand, if it's culturally accepted then they will be ""there"" with you but it's always so arbitrary and any reason something could blow up and you could find you have no one with you. For the past five years I've been fighting the urge to kill myself (after my best friend blamed me for what happened), that's what I really wanted to do, instead I just sabotaged my life in small ways.

How is this legal? I could get thrown in jail for buying a ticket and selling it on craigslist, but stubhub can do it in bulk? I don't know how much Odesza would have gotten off of the original $52 tickets, but they've already gotten that. Now Stubhub is making 100%-200% of the tickets by doing nothing but buying and reselling them. They create a false demand for tickets and then jack up the price.

PTSD,"So I was at Global Dance Festival this weekend, and on Sunday I met this dude named Alex who claimed he was with Jack Beats in some fashion. 

I met him because I let him borrow my gloves to give his friends a light show, then he gave my girlfriend and I a light show. He was super good at gloving and a really cool guy, so we were just talking for a bit, then he tells me he's with Jack Beats. Then he tells me he want's me to work for him, and he tells me to look him up and gave me what he said was a German number. (It's like a 17 digit number.)

So I got home and searched for Jack Beats and he's definitely not one of the djs, but I think he might have been with them at the show.

Does anyone know of an Alex that works with Jack Beats, or was this guy just telling me stories?",SolidSmoke2021

PTSD,"Hi all,

It occurred to me recently that I've become an extremely isolated person ever since my trauma. I was quite the social butterfly both online and IRL. Since then, I've been terrified of socializing with people and approaching others just because it can feel super isolating. I KNOW I can't be the only person who feels that way.
I thought I would share the idea of starting a Mumble server for gamers with PTSD to hang out on. We can create channels depending on what game we're playing, or even just hang around and talk crap. Whatever it may be, bottom line is that it is good for us to have some type of social outlet, and this can be a half-assed way for us to do so. Something is better than nothing, right?
I'm willing to fund this talk server myself if I get enough people willing to stick around and see the initial awkwardness through. 
I just want to create a safe place for us to not feel isolated anymore.
It's a shitty feeling :(

PM me if you're down with helping set this up.

Here's hoping I'm not talking to myself...


EDIT: I've gotten a lot of PMs from people interested in this server idea. :) It seems like it's something this community can benefit from and I want to make it happen. I will be working with one of the mods which I am in contact with and will be launching a server sometime within the next 2 weeks. I want to figure out first how to implement some type of safeguard from trolls. I've got a list made of the people who I've been in contact with and will be sending information to those individually when the talkserver launches.

PTSD,"Hi all,
I've been dealing with diagnosed C-PTSD for a little over a year now, and it has caused a lot of isolation in my life. It's really difficult to connect with other people since it's tough to relate to others. 
I've been alienated from the last online gaming community I was a part of due to some silly reasons. Unfortunately, I didn't realize how much I depended on that community as a social outlet. Since then, I don't speak much to other people.
I work a full-time job, and see my boyfriend whenever he can make time from his busy job and social life. I need to balance it out as well so I don't depend on him too much.
I just don't know how... I've been so disconnected from people since my trauma that I don't even know how to act around a group of friends anymore. 
Does anyone have any ideas on how to deal with this isolation due to C-PTSD? It's weighing quite heavily on me and I'm not sure how else to tackle it. It's like I don't know how to interact with people anymore.
I love playing online PC video games, so if there's some gaming community with some type of PTSD focus, that would be so awesome.
I don't know what to do anymore, I'm too in my head.",conyas0
PTSD,"You broke my heart.

I was fooled into thinking we had a solid, no-bullshit thing going on. I knew we weren't able to keep the LDR going, it was too hard to make time for it with this new job and with your job + schooling. At least I had the decency to initiate problem-solving conversations about it. I was happy that we ended the relationship as civil as I thought we did. It was really hard on me but I valued your sincerity and openness during the whole ordeal.

Even though it got harder to keep contact, I tried my absolute best to keep our conversations going. You don't know how much I looked forward to debating more politics and philosophies with you after getting home from work, but there was always an excuse to avoid me.
I didn't think you'd turn your back on me as harshly as you did. It really hurt me when you started beating around the bush instead if telling me you just weren't interested in keeping our friendship alive. It stung to hear you say you didn't see the point in talking to me anymore"". I didn't think you'd hit so low I just wish you had the balls to flat out tell me you didn't want to talk to me anymore. Sure it would have hurt, but at least the truth was told. 

I don't think you were as no-bullshit as you said you were. I know I fucked up in our relationship, as did you., At least I'm willing to admit my faults and discuss them further.

I could get past you neglecting me - but I didn't know you were this cold.
I mean, One day you decide you didn't love me anymore and just hear me cry with a straight face. Two days later you want to take it back and decide you love me.  It's a mind fuck I couldn't deal with. Even now, I'm not sure if you ever genuinely gave a shit about me.
At the end of the day, you're not as mature about these things as I thought you were. I loved the crap out of you and even now I miss you. Or rather, I miss the idea I had of you.

Thank you for being as supportive as you were in the very beginning of our relationship. We had some pretty great times, which I'll never forget. And I'll forever be grateful to you for flying me out of that hell hole after I was assaulted.  

I have no ill intent towards you. I only wish you happiness and clarity. I will respect your wishes and leave you alone as I have since you said those sharp words.
I hope that in the future, you don't treat anyone else like you treated me. You told me time and time again that you didn't want to become like your father. Little do you realize that you already became him. You don't have to be like him.

 Morph banes on the run, 2 at a time in zvz. This pre- splits them into pairs for you. Perfect for taking out his clump of like 6 banes, or to hit the mineral line. On the run means while your lings are running you ""studder morph""... EE... EE... EE... Credit to PiG of course!

Hold position.  
When attacking a building like an enemy hatchery with lings, once they get the surround, hit the hold key, then go back to your macro. This will cause your lings to auto attack any enemy lings that attack them. otherwise they just keep focusing the hatch. Doesn't work against ranged attackers of course like queens.

The armory is a single point of failure in their security and it is wide open. Any outsiders that want to take the town don't need to take every house and everyone in it. They don't even need to take on Rick or Michonne or Daryl.

All they need to do is take out one overweight barista who keeps a closer eye on chocolate than on the guns. 

If you can seize the armory you can seize the town, and the mayor is dead set against changing that and distributing the weapons. 

Rick knows this and he is already working towards it. But will he do it? Daryl is already on the fence about it. And if he does, does that turn him into an anti-hero or do the ends justify the means? What do you think?

PTSD,"I have some health issues right now and soon I will have to leave to go to VA for a consult with a urologist. 

Well Im in too much pain to work so I get to spend the whole day with my son. Granted, I did this when I was a stay at home mommy, but since getting a job, I didn't have the entire day.

PTSD," I hate my health. Every time something goes wrong, it all comes in full force.
Im currently being discharged from the hospital for the second time in less than a 24 hour time period. 
 My first visit was your pretty standard checkup in the Emergency Room. They tested my urine and concluded I had Hemorrhagic Cystitis (which is a fancy way of saying, a severe UTI causing damage to the bladder that sometimes, like my case, can cause bleeding in the bladder).They gave me antibiotics and painkillers and sent me home. Everything was fine and dandy the rest of the night.

Well early this morning, around 5 am, I woke up screaming and hurled over in pain. The right side of my back was killing me and we quickly made it to the hospital because I couldn't bare through the pain.

After urine tests, blood tests, and an overdue CT Scan, they discover an 8MM FUCKING KIDNEY STONE. For the untrained mind, thats fucking massive. Too big for me to pass on my own, so now I have to visit a urologist to see if he can break it down or if I have to have surgery. Ughhh.. Like I said, I hate my health.",tigerlilybeauty

I sit here in a hospital bed, waiting for my release papers, if I ever get them.

I came in because I was urinating blood. Apparently my bladder is bleeding and an infection is leading its way to my kidneys. My medicaid was terminated two months ago and have no way to pay for this bill. 

My sister in law is watching my son next to me because I can barley lift him, AND they think I have a cyst on my ovary.

PTSD,"My partner (henceforth Partner) is trans, and between him and I (genderqueer faab), we have no issues regarding his identity or gender expression. We both identify as queer. Partner is comfortable with his masculinity with me, says he never feels emasculated by anything I say or do, and I do not out him ever. We live together, but have separate bedrooms because we are, and always have been, polyamorous, and we have no veto power. We voice our concerns over other people openly and talk all the time to make sure we are doing well. We've been together for a few years now, we have been through our share of shit, and we're still very happily together.

Now, I recently met a cis-man (Dude) that I have been interested in. The other day, Partner suggested having Dude over for dinner since he hadn't met Dude yet, and just recently I had met Dude's wife. Pretty standard poly getting-to-know-you stuff.

When Dude left, I asked Partner what he thought, and at first Partner was pretty vocal against Dude, saying Dude had lied about some stuff (he hadn't, he just didn't talk about everything that Partner already knows about Dude, and which Dude actually knows I've told Partner). Partner was even so angry when I pointed out that Dude didn't lie, that he stormed off and slammed some doors. Clearly, it's not about Dude, it's something about Partner himself...and it turns out to be about his masculinity. At least I'm 99% certain it is.

It seems that Partner is feeling exceptionally vulnerable because Dude is cis. He's convinced that if Dude ever found out he's trans, that he'd treat Partner as ""less of a man."" Now, I don't think so, but I won't out Partner anyway, that's his thing to do, not mine. But Partner thinks this because ""Dude just seems like the kind of guy who would look down on his masculinity"" because he kind of reminds Partner of this guy he went on a date with once, who has since outed Partner every chance he gets (total douche).

So my question is: How do I support Partner through this struggle with his identity and masculinity? He hasn't quite come out and said it's about that, but everything he's said so far really suggests it's an issue he's having within himself, and since he is super convinced Dude would treat him as less of a man, it makes me wonder if Partner himself has part of himself who struggles with his trans identity, and even maybe judges himself on his masculinity/manhood.

Just so we are clear: I will never out Partner to anyone, not even someone I'm having a relationship with. If someone thinks I'm dishonest because I didn't tell them one of my partners is trans, then that person can fuck off because it's not my business to out Partner, and it's not anyone's business what Partner was assigned at birth or what he has under his clothes.

**TL;DR**: It seems my partner (we are poly) is struggling with issues of his masculinity in the context of me getting to know a cisman more intimately in the last little while, and I would like some advice on how to support him through this. I do not, and never will, out him, so he's safe with me in that sense, but in this case, that does not appear to be making a difference in his comfort level with things. Thoughts? Ideas?",DrLamLam

PTSD,"So, as per this thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/RBNSpouses/comments/2b6u9y/hubby_and_flead_mil_update/

there was a conversation to be had with my MiL over leaving the door open and fucking up everything that I was doing with trying to integrate cat #4 into my household, quarantine, etc.

So she came over today to pick up her dog for the day, which I appreciate, for sure. But I said we needed to talk, and I explained that I was angry because she hadn't closed the door to cat #4's room, and explained very directly, bluntly but respectfully, why that resulted in me being angry.

I am, first and foremost, glad she apologised, even if it was preceded by a bunch of attempts at deflection and distraction.

""I'll remember now that you've told me to make sure."" (We talked to her about this a number of times actually.)

""You think I did it on purpose?!"" (When I said that I was having difficulty trusting that she'd remember because she has repeatedly not remembered in the past.)

""I tried to call [husband] to tell you I was coming over since I forgot your number."" (Randomly in the middle of me talking to her about being angry, as a distraction.)

""[Husband] hasn't been picking up any of my calls, it's not like I don't know where he is. I know he's in [hometown about 3 hours away driving]."" (Still unrelated to our conversation and a distraction, maybe hoping to illicit a discussion or defense of my husband so I'd forget I was mad? And besides, he actually told her not only that he was going to his hometown but also that he was going camping and would have an intermittent unreliable signal.)

""I'm sure Cat #4 doesn't have any diseases anyway."" (When I said that cat #4 actually got into a physical fight with one of my cats, and that I'd been keeping them apart for quarantine since cat #4 was an outdoor cat and never had shots.) I told her that it wasn't her call to make.

So I stayed calm, continued to make eye contact and redirecting the conversation back to the topic. Pretty proud of myself!

And then I had a chat with husband, cut short by, of course, the poor signal, but still had a chance to update him, give him a heads up, and make sure everyone was having fun camping. My MiL has actually played her children against their partners multiple times, too, claiming the partners were mean when her children weren't around, so I just wanted to cut that right out and make sure husband knows exactly what went down, before she starts doing that thing of hers again.

Yup. I feel great about that interaction!",DrLamLam
PTSD,"Original thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/RBNSpouses/comments/29vh2t/hubby_and_flead_mil_mostly_just_a_vent_because_i/

So... after having many conversations with my husband about how his mother drives HIM insane to the point that he and I are having difficulties... he absolutely lost it on her because he was already upset knowing I wanted to leave to stay with my mother, and he was angry about that, and angry that my sister couldn't visit because of his mother (he and my sister are really good friends, and my sister lives in another country and is here only for a short while)... she said ""fine I'm going to leave, I am not going to spend another night here!""

...and she did. She went to a local women's shelter for women without housing... Which I said she should do right away, because they have resources to help find housing but those resources are only available to people living in the shelter...

And within a couple of DAYS my husband started to feel better...right up until she started spending all day here and just sleeping at the shelter. He had to explain to her that doing that was JUST as bad as staying here.

So she's been getting some assistance, we've been taking care of her dog, took back the cat, unfortunately have to take care of her gecko too... but fine, animals I can take care of as a favour, even if I had to pay out of my pocket to get her dog deflead and dewormed so that those wouldn't transfer to my animals...

But she's still...excruciatingly child-like. Every fucking time she comes here to get something, or take her dog for the day, she breaks something, messes something up, etc. It's like she just doesn't care enough to think enough to respect our space and us.

Case in point:

When I visit my mother, who has two cats, I take my cue from my mother as to how to treat the cats. My mother is absolutely paranoid her cats will get outside and run away, so I always make sure the doors are closed, the patio door has the screen locked if I want the door itself open, that sort of thing. She's also paranoid the cats will get into something and hurt themselves, so I make sure not to leave any hot pans anywhere in the kitchen unsupervised, I close the bathroom so they don't get in there, etc. Basically, whatever SHE does to feel comfortable taking care of her cats, I make sure **I** do when I'm there.

So right now I'm keeping cat #4 locked up in a separate room partly for quarantine (she was an outdoor cat with NO shots) and partly so that I can slowly try to integrate her with my three. It's been about 3.5 weeks that we've had this cat, slowly getting her used to my cats, and slowly getting my cats used to her smell, to seeing her through a crack in the door, even sniffing noses a couple of times. Slow, but it was going great!

Until tonight. I heard a massive screech-fest-cat-fight, went running, and what do I find? Cat #4 has gotten out of her room and is in a fight with my cat #2 (my big maine coon male). Full on tumbling and screeching fight. Thankfully it dissipated as soon as I came running since it's not exactly the safest thing to stick your arms into that sort of tumble...

Why did cat #4 get out? Oh, because that room also houses MiL's plants, and MiL went in there earlier to water said plants, AND DIDN'T CLOSE THE DOOR. That door closes SO easily and SO securely, she actually had to have NOT CLOSED THE DOOR AT ALL.

Quarantine? Gone. Slow introduction? Gone. Hatred between cats? Massive. Fucking hell.

**TL;DR**: MiL is staying at a shelter, getting help, but continues to just completely thoughtlessly disrespect our space, our things, which resulted in completely fucking up my slow process of cat integration and cat quarantine.",DrLamLam
PTSD,"I know we have the term ""love-bombing"" which I happen to think is a super amazingly useful term.

I haven't seen ""excuse-bombing"" before, but I've certainly been seeing it a lot lately from my husband's Nx, who is starting to realise she's lost any power she thought she had with respect to the courts and is now terrified of being called back in (husband wanted some information regarding his children and she wouldn't give it to him, so he said he'd just go to court to have an order compelling her to tell him because he needs to know in order to take care of the kids when they're here) and as soon as she got cornered, knowing the court would agree with my husband, she sent a barrage of reasons why she hadn't given it to him already.

And when he said nothing...she kept sending stuff ALL DAY. And then the next day. All various excuses for why she didn't already do it. It went on for over 24 hours with zero input from him. I'm sure the fact that he didn't answer was only driving her nuts and freaking her out because she didn't know if he was still going to take her to court over it...

So I ask all of you: do your Ns excuse-bomb when caught in something?",DrLamLam
PTSD,"**Background**

So my beloved husband's mother got evicted as of June 30 and is staying with us until she finds a place to live. Our living room is now her bedroom, her stuff fills the living room floor to ceiling, wall-to-wall, with only a tiny spot for her single cot.

His mother, sweet though she is, is one of the most flead individuals I have ever met in my life. She constantly asks hubby for things instead of doing what she needs to do to get them herself... ""Honey, can I use your vaporiser battery? I haven't charged mine."" No, hubby needs it for HIS vaporiser. ""Honey, do you have $20 I could borrow?"" ""Honey, do you have any smokes?"" ""Honey, could you buy me ____?"" within minutes of getting up she's already asked for a bunch of stuff.

She also likes to be ""helpless"" so that she's taken care of, and when she's doing something herself, she does that whole thing where people make obnoxious noises to show everyone just how HARD something is so that people might come and offer to help. Or even outright says ""It's so hard to do this by yourself!"" but never actually ASKS FOR HELP. (When she does that, I ignore her.) She crosses boundaries CONSTANTLY. Walking into our bedroom, taking stuff she wants to use from the bedroom or from our drawers... Boundaries are 100% NOT her strong suit.

Anyway, this of course infuriates my husband who has never actually had a competent mother. She was an enabler and now is just childlike and helpless. He raised himself and to a degree, his brother helped raise him. But his mother never did. She actually also engaged in emotional incest, using my husband as her own surrogate husband from when he was about 6 to 15. He often says how much he wished that he didn't have to parent his own mother.

She's kind, but so flead she may as well be an N sometimes. So of course MiL is staying with us until she finds a place to live, and so husband is constantly angry, like, non-stop. From the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed, he's angry, irritated, fed up with yet another thing she's taken, broken, not put back, torn up, etc.

So she lives with us. She's been here four days and already husband has lost it first thing in the morning four days in a row. He even lost it over the fact that she stuffed things randomly in the fridge so the door didn't close properly and just left it there. Who bears the brunt of him losing it? Oh yeah, me. Because I'm up in the morning, too, and end up hearing him vent (which, fine, I'm his wife, I'm THE person to go to vent and get support), but he throws things in the kitchen and just generally acts like a jerk. Thing is, he's NEVER been like this except with his mother living with us (we've lived with her once before when his father was dying of cancer). He has no anger issues when it's us or even us and the kids. It's just when his mother's in our space.

**Issue now**

So, we took her in and gave her two weeks to find a place. She's doing EVERYTHING she can to NOT find one (which I warned him she'd do, but let's put that aside for a moment). First, she starts looking for really expensive places...umm, you just got evicted, you can't afford expensive places with nice fixtures and fancy whatever. So I actually had to bluntly tell her to start looking for a shared room with someone.

""Oh I can't live with someone. I really like living alone.""

""I don't want to live with anyone, I really value my privacy.""

""I just don't think I could share a kitchen with someone I don't know very well.""

So fine, FINALLY I get through to her that her ONLY option is shared accommodation right now.

""I can't find anything that allows my dog.""

""This one is on a hill and I just can't walk up hill.""

""This one isn't near the foodbank...""

""I called one place but they don't want someone older.""

""I went to see two places today, but they both required me to sign my life away."" [by which she meant fill out an application form...]

""I can't find any more, I guess I'll just keep looking...""

So today, after talking to my beloved mother, I bit the bullet, went on craigslist, and in the span of 15 minutes found SEVEN PLACES WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF OUR HOUSE (which means near the local foodbank). So I printed them all off, and handed them to her. 100% selfish, no altruism there whatsoever, let's not beat around the bush. I did it because now she had an audience (my best friend) who saw me do that, and she HAS to call them.

And what do I hear when I walk out of the kitchen?

""Well this one's no good, it doesn't have internet.""

""I don't like the lack of pictures in this ad...""

**Talk with husband**

So I sat my husband down and said to him that I believe his mother is actively trying to find excuses not to move out because she wants to live with us where she can constantly ask my husband for things. I also told him that if she's not gone in two weeks, I will be taking my cat and staying with my mother until she does find a place, because otherwise I fear it will tear him and I apart.

**Why I'm sad**

I said that I didn't want it to get to that point, and I found her the bunch of places to look at because I really want her to get the fuck out of our space...

And my husband looked at me for a few seconds then said, ""Let's not kid around, you're going to end up at your mom's, and this fucking sucks.""

Which, translated, means: ""my mom guilted me into reneging on the two week limit because she knows guilt is what gets me, and I know I won't be able to tell her to leave even though there are places for her to go, and I know that she won't be out in two weeks because you're right, she's trying to make sure she doesn't get a place.""

**TL;DR**

Flead MiL has been evicted and is staying with us until she gets a place. Hubby gave her a two week limit, because her presence is super unhealthy for him and for us, but because she's a master guilter, she's already got him to reneg on it, and so I've decided to take care of myself and if she's not gone in those two weeks, to take my cat and go stay with my mom until MiL has left. Husband acknowledges that it'll likely come to that because his mom has no intention of moving out and wants us to take care of her.

**EDIT**: Now I'm actually livid. Not sad. Not angry. LIVID. Husband went to talk to her about how she should prioritise and to ask her about how it's going with the seven places I found for her... And she says to him ""Well, they all say to contact them between 9 and 5 so I'm waiting until tomorrow to do that."" No they don't. ONE said that. ONE OUT OF SEVEN. The other six DO NOT HAVE ANY TIMES LISTED ON THEM regarding contact. A fucking blatant lie. I didn't hear it, so I can't call her out on it, yet, but fuck, I'm super pissed off now.",DrLamLam

PTSD,"...so xNSiL sent me another message on Saturday (which I didn't notice until this morning because it ended up in the ""other"" mailbox on Facebook). She used yet ANOTHER account to do so, which she then either deleted or blocked me on, whichever is fine with me haha.

But the point of this post is this:

**What brings me immeasurable joy whenever I have to deal with an N is NOT RESPONDING TO A SINGLE THING EVER.** Nothing tortures an N more than someone who just never engages with them on anything they say or do.

The fact that xNSiL sent yet ANOTHER message despite complete silence from me for many, many months is proof that not answering her drove her far more insane and pissed her off way more than anything I could've ever come up with. No matter what I came up with to say, she could no doubt weave that into being an N-supply, to feel sorry for herself or to confirm whatever story she's made up for herself. Lack of engagement is the only thing that she can't actually weave in to her N-supply and it's driving her up the fucking wall.

The fact that for months and months, years now, my Nx has randomly sent messages hoping I'll answer something--anything--is proof that not answering is the one thing that actually drives them batty. He can't handle that to this day, I've never once ever reached out to him, or answered anything he said, or gave him the time of day.

The moral of the story is: If you ever want to get back at an N, know that the one thing that REALLY gets to them is non-engagement. Never answer another message. Don't acknowledge their existence. It will cause them more torture than anything you could ever say or do to them.",DrLamLam

For the last four days, I've been observing these ants, they're about 8mm long, carrying larvae along side the sidewalk outside my house (Vancouver Island, Canada). The larvae are definitely alive, I briefly stole one from an ant to look at it closer, looks like an ant larva from photos online, then I gave it back to another ant wandering the same path. Thus far I haven't seen them carrying any pupae, just larvae.

My question is: are they just moving a nest or did they raid another nest with the intention of enslaving these larvae? Are there slave-making ants on Vancouver Island? In North America? The ant looks pretty typical for a larger ant of this region, not aggressive, I can hold them and they just wander around my hands without biting me.

PTSD,"For some reason I feel the intense need to articulate this right now, as it feels like this great epiphany for all the other symptoms I struggle with.

The hardest part, for me, of my PTSD, are the days when I cannot comprehend written language. I wish I were exaggerating.

I am a PhD student, I work a lot in philosophy, and there are days--sometimes endless days--when I look at my own work and I can't even comprehend my own writing, even though it made sense before. And then when that passes, I can comprehend it again, and my profs comprehend it, so I know it's not complete gibberish... but those days, sometimes weeks, when my brain just doesn't work, when I look at my writing and go ""what the f---?"", when I read a book that I'd been reading just the day before and want to throw it against the wall because nothing makes sense...those are the hardest for me to deal with. I don't know *how* to deal with them.

I have other symptoms, many of which can be reasonably managed by medication and therapy, my hypervigilance isn't so bad anymore, my nightmares are pretty much shut off as long as I take my meds, I don't really fly into rages as long as I take my meds, and my (permanent but thus far not debilitating) hearing loss thanks to one of the medications is acceptable as long as the meds are keeping me alive and semi-functioning...

But the brain thing...I think that's what feeds my anxiety and depression most of all, because my depression lifts every time I can work (and it follows the pattern of successfully working --> depression begins to abate rather than depression abating allowing me to work), and my anxiety lowers considerably when I have worked on my writing during the day.

And I don't have any other way of defining myself, either, so my entire sense of self is bound up with being a PhD student. PhDs are all-engrossing, so it's kind of hard to have much else to define yourself by, though I know people certainly do manage it (I just haven't figured out how myself).

But I have encountered a problem and I'm wondering if there's anybody out there who's experienced a similar thing:

I am working on a large collection of research to write a chapter in a book with my dissertation supervisor, and I've found that there are entries in this document, commentary on things I've read and the like, that I have zero recollection of making. It's to the point where I'm reading the article again and I have none of those ""oh yeah I've read this"" or even ""this is familiar"" feelings. But I'm the only one working on this document, so it was 100% me that did the work.

It's like when I crashed, I must have completely lost lucidity and touch with reality/memory and now that I'm starting to come out of that, I don't recall what I did during those times. Not in the sense of ""I don't remember how I spent my days"" (which I don't, but that lack of memory doesn't stand out) but in the sense of my own work is foreign to me. I have proof, essentially, that I did things that I do not recall doing at all.

I feel...really vulnerable realising that. I feel uncertain, too, because what on earth did I do during those times?!

And then it just brings up my usual anxiety which is: is there stuff about my trauma (10 years of abuse, including rape) that I just don't remember. But that I can sort of stop from spiralling out of control.

It's the ""I don't remember things I did a month ago"" that *really* bugs me...",DrLamLam
PTSD,"This is totally just a rant, and I know that at some point, he'll probably apologise because he knows he's wrong and he's usually much much better at this sort of thing, but for the moment, he's pissy, and I'm seriously sick of it.

The neighbour downstairs woke him up by screaming ""fuck"" a few times and throwing things around his suite. I get that's frustrating. It's 7 am. It's Sunday. I get it.

But then DH screams ""shut up"" and stomps on the floor. This wakes ME up. So I get up, and DH is making coffee, and he starts bitching about the neighbour to which I replied ""it's kind of ironic, considering you woke me up doing exactly the same thing.""

So DH launches into what essentially amounts to a non-apology. Usually he's better at this shit, but not this morning. ""I'm sorry but (insert all the reasons it's not my fault)."" And I didn't engage, I didn't say anything, and so he repeats it, with another reason why it's not his fault. And another. He was half ~~away~~ awake, it's Sunday and he's mad, it's early, he didn't want to be up...

So I calmly said that wasn't an apology, he was trying to justify his behaviour. It couldn't be both.

So he says ""Thanks!"" [wtf?] and slams the door to the bathroom to take a shower and mutters loudly (I heard it OVER the shower, so it was definitely not quiet) repeating what I said about it being one or the other, justification or apology.

I still don't engage.

So now he's ignoring me. I *really* don't feel like dealing with this shit this morning.",DrLamLam

PTSD,"I've been on anti-depressants before, several different ones, as well as mood stabilisers, and I have a question:

The doctor always starts off at a low dose, which I understand to be because it is a new drug and my body needs to get used to it. However, this low dose has a positive effect that lasts for a bit say a few days, a few weeks, then it slowly wears off, until my doctor says okay time to increase your dose, and then that repeats until the doctor finds the ""right"" dose for me, which works for a long period of time.

But how does this ""right"" dose work? How is it that to use my most recent anti-depressant example, 20mg of Cipralex works consistently for a long period of time, but 10mg worked for a bit then faded (rather than simply not working and therefore it being clear that it's not enough)?

I understand that each class of anti-depressants chemically works differently, and that SSRIs for example do something completely different than Lamictal (anti-convulsant doubling as a mood stabiliser) or lithium (an actual mood stabiliser). And yet, it seems they generally follow this pattern of work, fade, work, fade, work-oh-perfect-dose-not-fade.",DrLamLam

PTSD,"So my DH is the child of a NF and has children with an N, and as a quick intro, here's the family he comes from:

NF: dead now coming up on two years

M (my MiL): fleas galore, mostly defensive, assuming there's not enough food for her, bracing herself because everything was always her fault before so now she thinks it is even when we say it isn't, not an easy flea to get rid of

Older brother (my BiL): many fleas as well, super good guy, JUST got out of a relationship with psycho abusive N (I call her NSiL if you look back in my posts, I guess xNSiL now) so super heavily traumatised as this occurred less than two weeks ago.

Younger sister (my SiL): extra heavy fleas of the emulatory variety, pretty selfish and self-absorbed though in the last two years since leaving her own Nx, has improved a lot. She helped BiL get away from his ex and in that time, not once complained about how this impacted her. So, improvements!

**Problem**: My dearest husband has fleas of his own, and first and foremost, shuts down at the word ""flea"".  Shutting down is the thing I have the most difficulty with and that's the flea in general that's bugging me right now, and I don't know how to address it. See, the thing is, anything important or big, he shuts down and leaves me to deal with it alone. I know it's a flea, I know he doesn't mean to and he's just so easily overwhelmed still (PTSD + fleas no doubt)...but that doesn't help us move forward.

Here are some examples...

- Shuts down when I mention anything regarding finances.

- Shuts down when I mention being upset at all, and finds excuses not to talk about it. ""I'm heading out for work, could you please not bring things up when I'm about to leave since then I think about it all day?"" ""I worked a 10 hour shift today, could you please not bring things up when I'm exhausted?"" ""It's my day off, I can't think right now, could you bring it up another time?"" Just WHEN does that leave me time to bring it up, exactly, you know, aside from NEVER??

- Can't talk at all about my feelings regarding dealing with his Nx, with whom he has kids. I am supposed to be able to be there for him when he has to figure out how to deal with more shit she's pulled, but he can't even be there for me when I explain how her shit just upset my day. Why? Because he's shut down. Again.

**So how do I talk to him about, well, anything important? Any advice or ideas?** How do I talk to him about the fact that because he refuses to talk about finances, I've barely managed to get him to count out his share of the rent. But all the other bills? I carry ALL the weight of them. Every last other bill, I pay. (Yes we have separate bank accounts, shared didn't work because he had too much anxiety to go to the bank and deposit his pay cheque, and shut down at the mere beginning of a discussion.) What about the fact that I am SO FUCKING ANGRY that his Nx is pulling shit and while I don't blame him, and never blame the kids, and I KNOW I got into a relationship with a man who has children...aren't I still allowed to be upset when her shit up-ends my day? When I have to go to the courthouse instead of doing my homework for university? What about when I have to drive to another city to help BiL file a police complaint? I'll do the stuff, I believe the stuff is important, taking care of the family and the kids and all, but I feel I'm not allowed to talk about my feelings because he just shuts down.

I actually can't really remember the last time we had a whole conversation about something important. We've had a few starts to conversations, and then they NEVER get finished because he shuts down and the next few times I ask to bring it up, he can't even tell me when he can, then it never gets talked about.",DrLamLam
PTSD,"So, some of you are NC, some of you still in contact regularly, but some of you are in the liminal zone of LC, depending on just how low it is... It is to you, I think, that this question is best directed at...

**I wonder, how do you come down from those brief moments of contact you have to endure for one reason or another, because for you right now NC isn't an option?**

I ask because I very occasionally have to have direct contact with DH's Nx, as she is the mother of his children, more frequently have to endure contact directed at DH because I'm still helping him figure out how best to manage his Nx's stupid bullshit which just doesn't seem to want to stop (recently, she's decided she's moving the kids, court challenge has already been filed, but even filing the court challenge involved me to an extent because I kind of keep my head cooler about the whole thing than DH does), and the last week and a half I had to endure NSiL's stupid bullshit [see my previous posts for a laugh] while waiting for BiL to actually go file a police complaint (he finally did once DH got through to him that his attempts at being ""the good guy"" were causing me and DH harm, as well as SiL and SiL's non-N-ex-boyfriend, and that NC makes sense if your Nx isn't harassing your family non-stop, at which point it's NC+police involvement, anyway)...

And now, although it's been a few days, last contact from NSiL was Sunday and last face-to-face interaction with DH's Nx was exactly one week ago, so Thursday, I'm having difficulty coming down from all this. Sleep still disturbed, full of nightmares, the tail-end of the NSiL saga was very triggering, I am pretty constantly angry right now, not calm at all, don't even want to share a bed with DH because I just want to be alone...

**What are your strategies to help you go back to your usual, day-to-day life?**",DrLamLam
PTSD,"Dear Narcissistic ex-Sister-in-Law,

I won't say this to you personally, because I've gone to the police with your continued harassment and I won't undermine my case by actually speaking to you. So anonymously it is, and maybe one day you'll come across it, though probably not, but at least I got to articulate the feelings swirling around in my body like a storm just waiting to hit.

You make me sick, and there is nothing in the world that you could say to trick me into believing that you have the ability to feel compassion, love, or to be nurturing. Everything you try is such a pathetically obvious attempt to trick me into believing that you're not an abusive narcissist. Sorry, you picked the wrong person to try to gaslight. At this point, nothing in the world will ever convince me that I'm wrong about you.

The way you try to use my words, twist them around and claim that you ""understand"" what I'm saying, all the while merely parroting me, hoping that if you just use the words I most recently said, I'd be tricked into thinking they were coming from you...it's sad, really, because you don't even see how obvious it is.

Thank you, though, for choosing a written medium for your harassment! I know you'd pick the phone if you could since you like screaming so much you do it while running down a street with arms flailing while bystanders watch and pity you, but you don't have our numbers -- you don't know them by heart and BiL took his phone away. This way, all I had to do was print everything off and go speak to a police officer. It's so much clearer how batshit crazy you are when you have it all printed out in front of you. So for that I really truly thank you! You made it so much easier for me to file a complaint with the police!

Normal = the things she's done so far

Italics = what so far /u/Greay66 and I think she'll try still

---

1.**Ignoring your requests to break off the relationship and attempting to continue on as if nothing has changed.**

- *She would if she had any way of getting ahold of BiL I'm sure, but she as yet hasn't just continued with HIM.*

- She HAS however randomly in her barrage of shit with DH and myself stopped being dramatic and acted like it was just a conversation ""so I talked to the neighbour...""

2.**Asking you when you’re going to “get over it” and return to your past actions.**

- *Again if she had a way to do it to BiL directly, she would've I'm sure, but hasn't been able to. The one time she got her hands on a phone, his voicemail was full anyway.*

3.**Sending you a fake apology to give you hope that things have changed.**

- Everything so far has been fake apologies, or well the first 24 hours was. ALMOST ""I'm so sorry"" but not quite.

- All the ""I'll stop drinking"" ""I'll tell the guy I've been cheating on you with anything you want me to"" (shouldn't you do that of your own accord and then tell BiL you've DONE it? Because this just gave away that you're still with other dude) ""I'll get help"" etc.

4.**Trying to trick you into contact by saying someone needs you, is sick, or in trouble.**

- Saying the dog is sick (though it's funny, she can't even just let that be its own thing, she has to finish that sentence with ""I can't go on like this!""); the dog is very important to BiL, has been with him for 11 years through the dissolution of his marriage, has been hit by a car and he saved it...VERY important to BiL

5.**Triangulating with others, communicating things to you through them.**

- All this harassment!! Harassing me, DH, SiL and honestly we think MiL too but MiL can't remember her facebook password or email address so we have no idea.

6.**Saying they’re worried about you, concerned about whether you’re okay, need to know where you are, etc.**

- *This one she hasn't yet, but I think she knows he's an SiL's, and since he's gone to work, I'm sure she's at least gotten someone at the job to tell her he's shown up or something.*

7.**Sending unwanted cards, messages and gifts, sometimes gifts for your children**

- *We think she'll probably go with presents to say ""Look, I got a job, I have money for us now, I got you this thing here!"" My Nx got me a movie once. 10 years of nothing, and he gets me a movie. Thanks, that helps pay rent totally.*

8.**Returning old items you left behind.**

- *BiL has a lot of beautiful woodwork made by his deceased father, and if she hasn't already destroyed it in a fit, it'll be her next bait, because she knows how much we all value the woodwork stuff, we all have some, and BiL was heartbroken over having to leave some behind when the old house was repossessed...*

9.**Baiting you with drama games.**

- ""I can't live without him"" ""I won't eat or sleep until he comes home"" etc.

10.**Contacting you about “important” things they “forgot” and suddenly have to tell you.**

- The whole keys thing, how he has someone's keys that need to be returned. Suddenly. Now. When they didn't need to be returned for months despite NSiL no longer having shifts at that person's house even...

- *She'll probably say something about mail coming in that he NEEDS to see, or the landlord needing to talk to him, since March 1 is coming up and she'll direct the landlord to him to get rent, probably with a sob story ""he left me without money!"" or some such.*

---

Now here's a question: what about adding an 11th tactic, the ""you hurt me by leaving you have to fix it by coming back""? Or would that be under the ""I can't live without you"" which would be #9?",DrLamLam
PTSD,"Narcissists are, indeed, oddly honest. The problem is, it's hard to catch, because we always want to believe the best about people, so we fill in the meaning of their words for them, assuming the best. Much like when we're jealous, we may assume negative meanings in things so that when our partner says ""Look, I need a break, I'm going to have a shower"" we may assume it really means ""Look, I'm sick of looking at you, I'd rather go have a shower where I can jerk off to thoughts of so-and-so.""

Those of us who are victims of N-abuse are partly picked for how well we assume the best in people, how well we read into what they say to THEIR benefit...

So, here are some examples from the current hole-digging my NSiL is busy doing.

1.**""I need help!""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: ""I need help with my issues so that I can get BiL back.""

*What she actually means*: ""I need your help to triangulate and I want to use you to get BiL back into my trap.""

2.**""I've spent 24 hours crying, I deserve it! I can't believe myself!""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: ""I've been crying because I've been so wrong, and I hurt the person I love, I deserve to be sad about that, I can't believe I would ever harm someone.""

*What she actually means*: ""I've been crying because my fucking victim is gone, I can't believe that I didn't break him well enough to keep him from getting away!""

3.**""I won't eat until he talks to me.""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: ""...because I'm so heartbroken!!""

*What she actually means*: ""...because there's no food in the house and since he was the one making money which I spent every time he had any, he didn't manage to buy food, there's no food in this FUCKING HOUSE.""

4.**""Please let him know I am stopping drinking!""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: ""Please tell him I'm going to work on my issues!""

*What she actually means*: ""...because he didn't leave me with any fucking booze.""

5.**""I recognise his value.""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: ""I recognise he's an amazing person that deserves to be treated with love and respect and care.""

*What she actually means*: ""I realise that he's an amazing victim, like no other victim I've ever had before.""

6.**""I made a fool of myself, and maybe I need help, I don't know.""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: that she just needs a bit of prodding to get the help, and that she made a fool of herself by hurting the person she ""loves""

*What she actually means*: ""I made a fool of myself by letting you all see that I'm abusive, I can't believe you guys found out! And maybe I need help, but maaaaaaybe everyone does, but I don't ACTUALLY *know* I need help, in fact, I doubt it, but I guess maybe.""

7.**""I'm not giving up on him!""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: ""I love him so much, our relationship means too much to me, I don't want to lose the love of my life.""

*What she actually means*: ""That fucking dick is not getting away from me, once you're my victim, you're ALWAYS my victim, you are my fucking property, and I will NOT let him get away.""

8.**""He is everything I've always wanted.""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: ""He's the most amazing wonderful man and I realise this and that I need to treat him respectfully and lovingly and not abuse him.""

*What she actually means*: ""He was the BEST fucking victim I've EVER had, and I realise that, that I will NEVER get as good a victim as he is. In fact, he's everything I've EVER WANTED In a victim.""

**EDIT**

9.**""I'll treat him the way he deserves.""**

*What she hopes her audience will assume she means*: ""I'll treat him with love and respect!""

*What she actually means*: ""He's going to get the fucking shit kicked out of him because he made me embarrass myself, he deserves to be punished for that, and I will DEFINITELY treat him the way I believe he deserves.""",DrLamLam

I blocked them on Monday. She of course made up a story to BIL.

DH got texts asking ""what happened! DrLamLam blocked me and I don't know what happened!"" except that SIL uses the phone to text, BIL does not text. DH refused to give details despite prodding saying ""We need to talk yes but on the phone."" While we have no proof, we are certain that it was NSIL. In fact, yesterday during the prodding, the phone got answered by a voice that was, DH said, VERY much sounding like NSIL, but instead said ""oh I just found this phone here, do you know whose it is?"" uh-huh. In the middle of those texts. Right. Anyway, they finally talked last night.

DH asked BIL to leave the room so the two of them could talk privately.

NSIL wouldn't leave him alone. DH kept calling BIL on not respecting his request to have a conversation without NSIL.

Pretty soon NSIL was screaming her head off in the background. DH says he definitely heard my name a few times. This, of course, I'm totally okay with, because I knew she would malign the first person to stand up to her. In fact, DH said to me ""she screamed things, and he repeated things, and I would've actually bought some of it, had you not said she'd say those EXACT THINGS before the conversation ever started. You're really good at predicting this shit.""

Somewhere in there, DH conveyed my letter to BIL. Then BIL pushed DH into saying things he wasn't ready to talk about, but in the end, DH said that he didn't like NSIL and hasn't since we found out that she's been beating BIL (including breaking his nose over make-up and kneeing him in the back over a cigarette). And since NSIL wasn't letting them have the conversation and BIL wouldn't assert the boundary, DH said he was done trying to talk to BIL that night, they could talk again when they had privacy, and DH hung up.

DH texted to say he was sorry that it went down like that, but that he felt the least BIL could do is show DH enough respect to talk to him privately, they're supposed to be best friends as well as brothers. BIL apologised and said they'd talk another day.

This morning DH wakes up to an email in which BIL outlines that EVERYONE has ""misjudged"" NSIL and that he was going to step away from all of us (his mother, DH, and me). (The email is very long, I have not read it, nor do I have any plans to, even if it were offered to me, which it hasn't been thus far. I have not read DH's reply either, this is all just what DH said to me this morning.) DH replied, saying that NSIL is going to drive every last person that BIL loves away and she won't stop until she does. She's already driven his ex-wife away (they were friends, co-parenting their FOUR CHILDREN), he doesn't see his kids at all even though they live in the city because NSIL has him working so much and whatever time he has, she requires it be spent on her, along with any money, so no child support is going to his FOUR CHILDREN either thanks to her, she's driven DH and myself away, as well as MIL. So DH said that he'll be here when BIL realises what's going on and decides to leave, but right now, NSIL is driving away every last shred of love from BIL's life.

And that's what I woke up to this morning.

I've since sat down with DH to explain to him that literally every word BIL wrote, he's actually talking to himself not to DH or any of us, even if he won't admit it. Saying we misjudged NSIL (ALL of us? Really?) is really him trying hard to convince himself that we did, and that he didn't. Saying she'll be around forever is him trying to convince himself that it makes sense to keep her despite abuse, because they're ""soul-mates"". I've heard it all before...from myself. When people tried to tell me about my Nx, I said exactly those things. ""You're being awful to him"" ""You have no idea who he is"" ""You don't know how he treats me in private, he LOVES me"" --- of course, the entire time I was actually trying to convince myself that he loved me etc. I know you all know what I'm saying.

*Note: no idea where to fit this in so just added at the bottom: NSIL also punched SIL in the face so SIL doesn't like her, either, but SIL is mired in her own divorce stuff so she's mostly absent.

This is really fucking hard. I am so good at cutting off Ns, but the other people that end up going, ""flying monkeys"" as /u/Greay66 has called them (people who buy into the N's shit), and the other people who lose those flying monkeys too (like DH losing his brother, at least for now) really hurts.

I can handle my heart hurting. But DH's heart hurting kills me.

**EDIT**: Apparently NSIL's convinced BIL that it's actually ME who's abusing DH and that I am isolating him and preventing him from having family in his life (yeah that's why I helped his MIL move here away from financial abuse by BIL and NSIL, whatever) and that I will cause DH to lose everyone he loves, and has BIL trying to convince DH to leave me and god only knows what BIL's said to MIL...haven't seen her yet today... But definitely is telling DH that I'm the abusive one and that NSIL is actually the good one, and that I'm just trying to turn the family all against each other. Bleh. I'll get over it, I just wanted to add that. I know it's typical N behaviour but it still stings. God only knows how DH feels, how I'd feel if my sister were saying these things to me...",DrLamLam

First image: the post on her page that I called her out on. I have an issue with sexism, firstly. But more importantly, she frequently says nasty shit about BIL to his face, then plays them off as jokes, which are invariably sexist. So when she posted this whole ""if men wrote valentine's candy"" nonsense, I didn't feel like putting up with it. It grossed me out. Mostly because he spent V-day working a 12 hour shift because she won't work and then she spends all his money on alcohol and make-up and clothes, so he couldn't get her anything.

Then the following images are the conversation. Note that although BIL ""likes"" her comment on my post, he was actually at work, with no access to the internet: she used his account to like her own post to ""support"" her. BIL later told DH that he wasn't the one on there, and that she'd yet again gone into his account to use it for something like that.

The conversation occurred before I heard from DH that BIL had taken the money from MIL, but by the time I heard the story from DH, I was so livid, I was done with NSIL.

So the last image is what I posted on Facebook just for her to see. As you can see, when you mouse over the security setting, it only was visible to her.

An hour later I deleted the post, and deleted and blocked NSIL, BIL, and their racist ""joke"" accounts.

I wasn't sure if she'd seen the one post to her, though DH told me this morning that she'd posted some really nasty shit about me on her profile, but then took it down (but I've taught DH well: he, too, took screenshots of everything!). But I deleted it because I figured I'd rather her not see it, if it meant that I could be the one blocking her. I didn't want her to have the satisfaction of blocking me.

But then tonight, DH had a phone conversation with BIL, or tried to anyway, about NSIL. Needless to say, she wouldn't give BIL privacy for the conversation, and then ended up screaming shit about me at which point DH hung up the phone. Turns out, she saw it. There's an element of satisfaction, for sure, knowing she both saw it AND I got to block her.",DrLamLam

PTSD,"I have three cats - T (9 year old DLH tortie female), M (4 year small maine-coon-type tabby male) and K (1 year old smokey black DLH male). All are fixed, all fed the same food, food is never left around the house, many litter boxes, many water bowls, all over the house.

Up until the other day, things went on as usual: T hates M, M loves T, so he usually cuddles her until she wakes up at which point she hisses/growls and he backs off. Sometimes if they make eye contact, I growls, too, but that's been going on for years now, so not new and not changing.

K on the other hand is friendly with both, plays with both, cuddles both, etc. He's definitely still treated like a kitten, with both T and M grooming him a lot. In fact, as long as K is in between them, T and M will happily lie on the same bed together, in a sort of line of cats.

Then **three days ago**: K starts acting like M is the spawn of the devil, evil, will kill him if he gets too close. If he so much as catches sight of M, K flattens his ears, makes himself as small as possible (not big, small), and starts screaming, trying to back up and hide, often even contorting as he scrambles to get away while not *looking* away. 

All the while, M stops moving completely, confused. He's not rubbing against things, he's not screaming or hissing back, nothing.

And yet sometimes they stand side by side without issue, sniff noses, and K even does that thing where he has his tail up then lets it flop sideways onto M which he's always done to anyone he loves (to T, to us humans). Yesterday they even ate treats out of my hand within an inch of each other.

**The only thing that's changed**: On Monday night, we put some of my mother-in-law's furniture in the foyer for the night, because we'd been moving all day and our suite is more accessible than hers, so when she was too tired to move, we quickly shoved the last of the stuff into our place. She has two cats, a fixed female that she brought with her, and a semi-feral unaltered male that she didn't bring with her, but that probably sprayed everything back at her old house, including the furniture.

So we've taken all the furniture out, washed everything, floors, walls, put up happy kitty pheromones from Feliway (which chilled out M and T back when T decided she hated him, now she just hates him when he's next to her rather than the same room), and yet K continues to lose his shit at the sight of M. I have them separated at night, and during the day as long as I'm around, they don't really encounter each other, but I still separate them if I have to go out of the house.

Any ideas on what is (still) happening? I can understand semi-feral unaltered male warning spray can be stressful, but...

Any ideas on how I can fix this?",DrLamLam

**TL;DR:** NSIL and BIL, her victim, steal MIL's money so that me and DH have to pay for truck moving costs and rent for MIL for this month so that she doesn't lose her new apartment. I have to go NC with both BIL and NSIL because NSIL is causing too much damage. I love BIL but...no.

So as you may have seen from some of the memes I've posted, my sister-in-law is a narcissist. To make it more clear, my husband, DH, has a brother, my BIL, and this is BIL's girlfriend, I call her a sister-in-law because it's easier. Fewer words, less explaining.

DH's mother, MIL is moving to our city, into our building in fact, today. She's not N, has a few fleas because DH's father was an N, she met him when she was 14 and he just died a year and a half ago when she was 57. So, she's got a lot of growing up to do, but she's 100% definitely not an N. In fact, she's one of the kindest people I know and I am lucky to have her as a MIL.

When MIL visited recently for two weeks, she got the place, put her deposit down, and while her income is limited to widow's pension and some other government stuff, she definitely has enough to keep herself and her dog and cat comfortable. And the suite is perfectly within her means, AND she gets us right here to help her and share stuff like our wireless internet and Netflix with her. She left two weeks ago to go pack up her house in the city she'd been living in, four hours away, and when she left, she had over $600 in her account.

Three days ago, when DH talked to her, she had nothing. NSIL is known to steal a debit card or make BIL take his mother's card and put her in overdraft just to satisfy whatever desire she has. BIL works 10-12 hour shifts almost every day. NSIL sits on her lazy fucking ass doing shit all. While MIL was here, NSIL couldn't even be bothered to go downstairs to feed MIL's cat so when MIL got back, the cat was fucking emaciated. FED ONCE IN TWO WEEKS the cunt. Anyway.

DH calls his mom yesterday, and some moneys had come in, and MIL had enough for the truck rental and her two weeks rent for Feb, and even some of March's rent. Excellent!

DH calls me today when he gets to the other city. Turns out his brother and NSIL took MIL's money, and she has nothing. No money for the truck, no money for rent, nothing.

We pay the $300 for the truck.

Looks like we'll be paying Feb rent for her, too, because it's not her fault that fucking BIL and his cunt of a narcissistic girlfriend took MIL's money.

And I'm done, I'm done being even civil to NSIL. With MIL living in our city, I am going to go NC with NSIL. Problem is, that means I'm going to have to go NC with BIL too, even though I love him dearly, because he's totally wrapped up in NSIL, has acknowledged some abuse instances (like the time she broke his nose because he wouldn't give her a smoke), but is still mired in convincing himself that their love is just passionate and fiery and that she's the one for him.

I'm pissed, because BIL is a GOOD GUY. He's just in that place where he's not ready to even acknowledge that his girlfriend is a cancer, draining and killing him. And he's certainly not ready to leave her. And I hate that I have to go NC with him.

And I REALLY want to send him a message before I go NC, though I don't yet know if I will. If I did, it would read:

> [BIL's name], I love you dearly but I am going to have to step away from you and [NSIL's name]. She is a narcissist and she is abusing you physically, emotionally, psychologically and above all financially, to the point that you are stealing money from your mother and putting her living situation at risk. You've also put me and [DH's name]'s living situation at risk because we are covering for your bad decision and making sure that your mom has a place to live. I'm sorry that keeping myself, [DH] and your mother safe from [NSIL's name] means that I have to also stop talking to you, and I will be here when you are ready to leave [NSIL's name]. Until then though, I want to say I love you and goodbye.

So fuck, I'm pissed. I totally am comfortable going NC with narcissists, I've done it before, and I've cut quite a few out (especially once I realised I had surrounded myself with Ns to feed my fleas). But I am SO FUCKING ANGRY that I have to cut out BIL too, because if I don't, this shit will continue, and it will continue to invade our fucking lives.

DH and I take care of those we love, and we'll figure something out to make sure we pay our rent for March, too, but at the moment, our rent money has gone to cover MIL's because of the really fucking BAD DECISION BIL made because of his fucking N-girlfriend.

SO. FUCKING. ENRAGED.

PTSD,"So I have a narcissistic sister-in-law. Long story, but my husband's dad was an N, husband's brother is wonderful but tends to pick Ns to date, so current girlfriend of brother-in-law is a total, complete N. N in sheep's clothing, working in a caring profession, but that's another store altogether.

So she posted an offensive joke on her Facebook which I felt his morning like calling her out on. It's sexist, so I just said that such a sexist joke is not funny. She did the usual N thing saying RELAX it's JUST A JOKE OKAY? Jeez. So I said obviously it's a joke, that would be why I commented on whether it was funny, and though she made a couple more comments, I left it at that.

However, it got me thinking, why do I consider that such an offensive statement, ""relax! It's just a joke!"" and started reading about it, and ended up posting someone's blog entry up on my wall talking about how ""relax, it's just a joke"" is a way to shut down conversation. All in one it makes the person look crazy for thinking that something so innocuous could be a problem and shutting down all avenues for discussion as to why it is a problem.

So my friend and I are discussing the article on my page. No mention of the Nsil. Not even a mention of Nsil's post. Just discussion of how ""Relax! It's just a joke!"" is problematic.

So she, the typical predictable N, HAS TO POST ABOUT HERSELF in it.

I ignore it.

My friend and I discuss it some more.

Nsil AGAIN posts about herself in there, all about how she didn't mean to offend and (this is the best line I've ever read), ""I am the most non-judgmental person I know!""

I just lost it. I couldn't stop laughing. Not even ""my friends say I'm non judgmental"" hahahahahahaa. SHE IS THE MOST NON-JUDGMENTAL PERSON SHE KNOWS! YOU CAN'T COMPARE! Hahahahahahaha oh goodness.

Still laughing, hours later.

Edit: Forgot to mention she edited every comment she made after it was responded to, and has now since removed them. I couldn't help myself, I had to comment that screenshots were made for those times when comments are deleted. I was prepared: I really did screenshot all her comments, especially as they changed, because it was the most predictable encounter I've had with her yet!

Edit Feb 15: She couldn't handle it, she had to post again! Gee, that wasn't predictable at all... :P Not having the last word really drives them crazy, hey?",DrLamLam
PTSD,"I'm not sure if I'm asking for support or just need to express how much my heart hurts for my two step-kids today. One is the SG and one is the GC in their relationships with their mother, but here they're both amazing wonderful loved little kids whom we never play off each other, always show love equally and effusively... Anyway.

They were getting ready for school, and one was upstairs and the other downstairs putting shoes on. I gave the upstairs one (SG) a hug, and called the other (GC) upstairs for a hug, too. My partner was downstairs and said GC threw his schoolbag to run upstairs and get his hug.

As he reached the top of the stairs though, before I got up from my chair, what I read on his face broke my heart. It was pure, unhidden fear of rejection, a state of complete vulnerability. In that moment, the slightest hesitation to show love on my part would've shattered his heart.

So I grabbed him (gently) and held him and told him I love him and he's amazing and wonderful and I love having him around and being around him. And to have a great day at school and that I'd see him after school. 

Of course, the look of fear dissolved as he got the unconditional love he deserves and desperately needed in that moment. And he became the happy child that he is, feeling a bit more confident and distracted again by being excited at going to school.

But the look on his face. It took me a bit to realise just what exactly it was (beyond vulnerability) but he was bracing himself to be rejected. That's what it was. He had come running for a hug, automatically because he knows that his dad and I always always always show him love and affection...but in that last moment at the top of the stairs, fear hit him, and he braced himself to get fake love, or be dismissed, or any of the number of other ways N-parents harm their children. In that last moment the thought went through his head: ""you're so stupid for thinking that you'd get any love at all, why would you be so stupid as to run for a hug? Now she's going to laugh at you, because you were stupid enough to think anyone would want to hug you."" (And I've heard her say similar things, I know his mom, I know her arsenal of tools to dismantle people's hearts.)

And I got to thinking...SG has an easier time here, in a way. He knows that mom doesn't love him but dad and step-mom always do. Plain and simple. He doesn't get much back and forth from mom, he's always bad, so it's easier to predict and deal with. When he's sick, mom really won't comfort him. When he wants a hug, it's so superficial and emotionally depthless. But GC is fucked with, goes back and forth, sometimes mom seems to love him, other times mom gets him all the stuff he ever asks for, and yet mom's love is weird, it's not like dad's love or step-mom's love, it feels wrong somehow, and he never really knows if he's going to get nice-mom that day or mean-mom, if mom will hug him, or tell him he's a ""big boy"" and can handle not getting a hug, he doesn't need to cry about it. (Fucking N-parents, I know his mom, and I know the way she always says that people need to be self-sufficient and need to not cry when someone doesn't feel like giving them a hug --- what parent doesn't FEEL LIKE giving their child a ... fuck.)

And they're both under 10. When mom says ""I don't feel like hugging you"" that's crushing to a child, of COURSE the child will cry. Fuck. But feelings are not valid, not to an N-parent. And the last thing an N-parent wants to deal with is their child's FEELINGS...

PTSD,"Okay so we have this lovely concept of ""Fleas"" - issues that take the shape of narcissism like shadows or snow angels or echoes, picked up from narcissists as a result of being around them (to bring together a bunch of definitions). It's a metaphor, based on the idea that if you lay down with a dog with fleas, some of those fleas will end up on you.

I was thinking about them, trying to come up with some ideas and trying to make sense of them, reading lots of people's posts on them, and I came up with two different kinds of fleas (if you think of better names, let me know!):

1.) Defensive fleas - these are the ones you get when trying to protect yourself from a narcissist. For example, learning to hide your weaknesses, to never show emotion, to not ask for help, that sort of thing. Basically it's to try to survive the narcissist's abuse of you. They make sense when dealing with narcissists, and many really do protect you at that time! But, once you leave the situation with the narcissist, they end up being maladaptive, because they don't help in healthy situations. Often these become self destructive or counterproductive when they appear in healthy situations.

2.) Emulatory fleas - narcissistic-style behaviours that come from imitating/emulating (consciously or unconsciously) things that people with NPD do, but the person emulating doesn't have NPD, they just show some of the behaviours and/or thought patterns.

It's definitely easier to discuss and acknowledge defensive fleas than it is to acknowledge and discuss emulatory fleas. It's quite easy for us to say things like ""I never ask for help because I never got it anyway, I would just be yelled at for asking for help"" than it is to say ""when someone asks me for help, I assume they're incompetent, and I have to work at making sure that isn't my immediate assumption, that asking for help is okay, and that it doesn't mean this person is useless or stupid or incompetent.""

What are everyone's thoughts on the matter? Do you see both kinds of fleas in yourself, either now or in the past?

Here are two of the ones that I have the hardest time admitting. I have worked very hard on both, and I can counter my first instinct fairly well in the first, and getting better at the second...

- When someone tells me that my actions hurt them, my first instinct is to justify myself and find ""legitimate"" reasons for what I did, instead of simply saying ""I'm sorry"".

- I am threatened by people who are either equally smart or smarter, and generally on a gut level react very negatively. On rare occasions, I'll do a complete 180 and idolise someone I think is smarter. The latter doesn't really happen anymore, thankfully, but the former is one I'm actively working on right now. I'm not that great at it yet.",DrLamLam
PTSD,"I just need a moment to express that my absolute biggest, worst fear right now is that my new meds stop working.

I've been through SO MANY, I've tried different combinations, different doses, different classes of meds...

I know it's been a month now, and there are small ups and downs, and I have to be gentle with myself regarding my energy (can't dive into 10 hours-a-day working from 0-2...), but it's been working consistently. But I am so scared to be hopeful, so worried that as soon as I stop expecting it all to go to shit and start getting comfortable and feeling safe...it'll all come crashing down and I'll add yet another thing to the ""didn't work"" pile and return to my little hole of an existence...",DrLamLam
PTSD,"So I've been reading a lot in this sub regarding narcissistic parents and their effects, partly because I have experienced abuse at the hands of narcissists myself, and partly because my partner's ex is a narcissist, and he has two kids with her. We have joint custody, so the kids go back and forth.

I'm hoping that having experienced what you all have at the hands of your parent(s), you lovely people might have some advice on how to contend with the things she says and does while the children are in her care.

I want to ask specifically about this because I think it's a bit different than living with her full-time, and every time we have the kids, something new comes up that she's said or done, that we have to undo or challenge...everything from reasons why we are ""not good parents"" to outright claims that we don't love the kids (""mommy said that if you loved us, you'd do ___"" and ""mommy said that you left because you don't love me"" and ""mommy says that you don't want to see us"").

Both kids are under 10, the older is the GC, the younger is the SG. She also makes this status super obvious. As narcissists do, she shows ""love"" by buying gifts, so for the GC she'll lavish the child with anything and everything she can think of, tons of presents, big ones, expensive ones, and she makes sure to say just how much she spent. For the SG, she'll buy tiny things, if anything at all. Think $300 tablet versus $10 lego set.

Currently our strategies are things like never saying anything bad about her to them (so that they trust that we respect them); telling them we love them and that the people who're best informed about our feelings for them are us; making sure that gifts are equivalent; not telling them how much things cost (little kids shouldn't be worried about that anyway)...

But how do we contend with all the little narcissistic-abuse things she likely does on a daily basis? Like the SG never being good enough (we always make sure to praise and love openly), or the GC being her parentified-child etc...",DrLamLam

**Hoovering: manipulation to gain control over your choice to distance yourself from them.**

This is SUPER long and I don't really expect anybody to read it. I just found this immensely therapeutic and if anybody wants a laugh, here's some amazing narcissistic stuff.

---

After having read in detail about hoovering, and had many conversations with survivors of narcissistic abuse who had experienced their Ns using the exact same strategies as A1 did trying to get me to respond again, I decided to go through some of what A1 sent me five years ago and see just which tactics he used.

I decided to just focus on the emails he sent me after I told him to never speak to me again, so keep in mind: every single one of these was sent without ANY input from me. He just kept sending them. And sending them. And sending them. 

The players: 

**A1**: my narcissistic rapist ex-boyfriend

**Lara**: the woman he had an actual relationship with while with me, cheating on me for months. When we broke up, she flew him out to another province to stay with her three times. THREE TIMES. On her dime. Flew him out there, across the country. They had a tumultuous relationship during which time she kicked him out, flew him out again, kicked him out, flew him out again...

So, here are some highlights.

---

**1.) Ignoring your requests to break off the relationship and attempting to continue on as if nothing has changed.**

- (11/22/08) rambling about doing the dishes at Lara's

- (11/22/08) whining about how Lara wouldn't do his laundry for him

- (11/22/08) more whining about Lara, this time she went to a bar because she was mad at him

- (11/23/08) whining about how bad things with Lara were, as if I was still his support for things going on in his life

- (11/24/08) again even more whining about how boring his day is, like I care about his day?

**2.) Asking you when you're going to ""get over it"" and return to your past actions.**

- (12/01/08) ""How long is this going to go on?""

- (07/20/09) ""Has it been long enough? Being the 20th, I think that roughly puts it at eight months. Are you willing to speak to me?"" [*roughly? I cut him off on November 20. He knows it's EXACTLY eight months... Why else mention the 20th?*]

**3.) Sending you a fake apology to give you hope.**

- (12/05/08) After seven (SEVEN!) paragraphs all of which were him berating me for asking the police to make him stop emailing me, he signs the email ""I'm sorry."" Probably the closest he's ever come to apologising for anything.

**4.) Trying to trick you into contact by saying someone (including themselves) *needs* you, is in trouble, or sick.**

- (11/25/08) Has to leave ""irrational"" Lara, but ""at the same time, however, I know that I have to go back to my parents. I'm not really sure if I'm getting out of a bad situation and into a better one or a worse one.""

- (11/28/08) ""I can't handle this.""

- (11/29/08) ""I blew my nose, there was a lot of blood. What could that mean?""

- (11/29/08) ""I'm going insane, DrLamLam.""

- (11/29/08) ""I haven't eaten today. There is nothing to eat in this house. There is no cereal or macaroni or anything basic like that to be made. There is a large bag of potato chips, which I may later consume if I become desperate enough. I asked them if they ate. They have not eaten and apparently have no intention of eating. They plan to go out again. They asked me if I'd like to drive them. They seemed completely oblivious of what would happen if I was pulled over without a license. I wouldn't mind being orphaned at this point.""

- (12/02/08) ""There was blood when I blew my nose again.""

**5.) Triangulating with others, communicating things to you through them.**

- (11/30/08) Called and emailed my mother trying to ask her to tell me to answer him.

- (03/16/13) Messaged the only mutual friend he and I had at the time, to pass on a message to me asking me to drop the harassment/stalking charges. After this, I cut her off, too, because she knew about the abuse, she knew that I wanted nothing to do with him, and she still insisted on violating my boundaries by sending me his message.

**6.) Saying they're worried about you, concerned about whether you're okay, need to know where you are, etc.**

- (11/22/08) ""Why can't I dial through to you?"" [*I changed my number when I cut him off, at which point calling my old number played a recording ""We're sorry, the number you have dialed is no longer in service.""*]

- (11/25/08) ""Please tell me what's happening?""

- (12/20/08) ""I keep hearing about storm warnings or high wind alerts. Could you just tell me that you and [your cat] are alright?"" [*You know, the cat he hated and told me he wished I'd never got...*]

**7.) Sending unwanted cards, messages, and gifts.**

- Aside from all the emails I'm quoting here...

- (12/08) and (01/10) sending me coca cola polar bears in the mail, as they were his iconic toy

- (08/10/09) unwanted ""happy birthday"" message

**8.) Returning old items you left behind.**

- (12/24/08) ""Why won't you accept the parcel? There are some gifts as well as some personal effects.""

**9.) Baiting you with drama games.**

- (11/22/08) ""Just tell me that you don't love me.""

- (11/22/08) ""I cut myself today and it hasn't stopped bleeding, even several hours later.""

- (11/22/08) ""Everything is beyond fucked up.""

- (11/24/08) ""I'm going insane, DrLamLam. I'm going to hurl myself through a window.""

- (11/29/08) The whole bloody nose thing I've already mentioned.

- (12/02/08) Again with the bloody nose.

- (12/05/08) [Highlights from email berating me for talking to the police] ""I guess you must have convinced whomever you spoke with that you were a pretty scared woman."" [*I handed them the stack of emails he sent me*] ""I've never seen the police respond to a harassment complaint in the absence of any substantial evidence."" [*A lie, since all I had to do was hand them the emails.*] ""While all of the neighbours are peeking through the windows..."" ""So congratulations: you've sufficiently shamed me in front of my parents and their neighbours."" ""I don't want to be seen on the street"" ""I don't want to talk to anyone.""

**10.) Contacting you about ""important"" things, especially things they ""forgot"" and suddenly have to tell you.**

- (11/29/08) ""...we need to talk about the concert."" [*I bought NIN tickets, in my name, on my credit card, that I paid for - any reasonable person would assume that if we're not talking, then they're uninvited and I'll be taking someone else.*]

- (12/02/08) ""The concert date is also approaching. I wish you'd say something.""

- (12/03/08) ""Look, we need to talk.""

- (12/04/08) ""The concert is tomorrow. Why can't you simply talk to me?""

- (12/14/08) ""I'm apologising in advance if Lara somehow manages to contact you."" [She NEVER did.]

- (12/24/08) ""Okay, why are you doing this? I'm getting emails from Purolator regarding a 'failure to deliver' or some shit. Are you trying to 'return to sender' these things or turning them away at the door? I don't know why you're doing this, dear."" [*Dear? Really?*] ""Could you please just tell me what the issue is here?"" [*At this point, it's been over a month since I told him to leave me alone, I haven't responded to a single message from him, AND I have already filed one police report against his continued unwanted contact. -- CLEARLY I DON'T WANT THE PARCEL FROM HIM.*]

- (02/12/09) He's asking for his tax documents...except he doesn't have any because he's NEVER HELD A JOB in his life, nor had he filed taxes ever. At this point, he's 25 years old, by the way. And no, we never filed jointly. Ever.

- (02/16/09) And again, asking about tax documents, which I still don't have, because he's never filed taxes. Mentions he owes the government a lot of money. Boo fucking hoo, he should've been filing taxes like all other adults. He's 25. The government probably imputed an amount based on the fact that they realised this 25 year old is running around having never filed a tax form in his life.

PTSD,"Hey everyone. I was thinking of brainstorming some strategies and things to expect from Ns if you implement the strategies. I have two threads going here:

""How to deal with the narcissist(s) in your life""
http://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/1q73rc/how_to_deal_with_the_narcissists_in_your_life/

""What to expect when you go NC""
http://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/1q97xa/what_to_expect_when_you_go_nc/

I've seen some excellent strategies here and was hoping to get a more detailed list so that we can have a resource to direct people when they ask these questions because these questions come up a lot. I think these strategies in general will apply to N-parents and just Ns, though details might be more specific (your N-ex may not say things like ""if you loved me, you'd respond"" necessarily, or they may, but maybe not ""you're an ungrateful child"", right?).

Please, if you feel up to it, contribute. And if you don't agree with something I have there, voice your opinion, let me know why you don't think it's a good idea. I really want to have a sort of go-to place to help people who are thinking about or have implemented NC or LC.",DrLamLam
PTSD,"I'd like to compile a list of things to expect from a narcissist if you should ever cut them off. I think if you go LC, things to expect there would work too.

For example: if you have been using various forms of communication and are now limiting it to one, expect your N to try to use the others pretending like they don't understand why you're not replying on them. ""Did you get my email?"" ""I'm not sure if you're getting my emails..."" etc.

**Please, brainstorm here! I'll edit this into a list once we have some stuff going.**",DrLamLam
PTSD,,DrLamLam
PTSD,"The best way to deal with a narcissist is, of course, to go NC. Unfortunately, sometimes that's not actually possible. For example, you may have a child with a narcissist and so you'll need to be in contact with the other parent. Or you may work with a narcissist. There could be any number of reasons why you can't just happily go NC with the narcissist(s) in your life.

**I should add that this applies to situations where you have at least some control. Not all of these are always possible, and if the narcissist has something over you (like you are a minor living with your N-parent), then dealing with it differs.**

So then the question is, how do you deal with them?

1. Go LC (low contact). This also may not be quite possible, but limit communication as best you can. Only communicate when you absolutely have to. And don't fall for what *they* consider important--only answer something if *you* consider it important.

2. Keep as much of the necessary communication in written form (aim for 100%). Writing means accountability and distance. If a narcissist just *says* something, they can then easily claim they never said it. That is why narcissists prefer speaking (in person and on the phone) and will likely never consent to having their conversations recorded. If they are forced to write things down, they have no choice but to be accountable (though they will fight it with every breath anyway). Writing also means you can step back and think rather than having to deal with things immediately.

3. Limit, as best you can, to one form of written communication. Keep it all texts, or all email, if you can. That way, it is easier for you to keep track of all the things they say because you have them in one place, and you don't have to jump back and forth between different media. If your narcissist can't speak to you, they'll look for other ways to confuse you so that they can work their manipulations. If you have all your communication in one medium, it's harder for them to try to make you jump around trying to keep track of what they say, and thus much harder for them to manipulate you.

4. Figure out what *you* want out of the relationship you have to have with the narcissist, and your boundaries. How much are you actually willing to give? What are you actually willing to do? Any relationship with a narcissist will include having to *look* like you're giving and taking. In reality, the narcissist is trying to only ever take and never give. So you must play into that, but never cross your own boundaries. If the narcissist asks for more than you're willing to give, stand your ground and respect your own boundaries.

5. Take time before making a decision regarding something the narcissist has requested of you. (Written communication helps with this, since the person can't stand there and pressure you to quickly respond and decide). If it doesn't feel quite right, chances are, it isn't. Trust your gut on this one.

6. Don't try to argue or reason with them because narcissists have a logic all their own. You will never get through to them nor will you ever get them to admit they're wrong. Not only will you get dragged into a long argument that you just can't win or get out of, even if you so obviously are right, they will distract you from topic you wanted to address in the first place. If you require a document and they give you all sorts of reasons for why they can't get it to you, don't try to argue their reasons. Don't try to prove that their reasons are crap. Just respectfully repeat the request.

7. Don't rise to them. If they're being immature and childish, calling you names etc., don't respond in kind. Keep things professional and on topic. They want to drag you down to their level and get you to argue with them because that's when they can best weave their manipulations. They want you to be emotional and show them your vulnerabilities. Ignoring their nonsense and just responding on topic limits the things they can ever use against you (and they are collecting everything they can to try to use it against you).

8. Keep your expectations realistic. The narcissist will never give you what you want or need because their world revolves around *them*. Remember this, and if you want something of them, present it in terms of how it will help and suit *them*. They're more likely, though by no means guaranteed, to do something if they feel it benefits *them*. What you understand as ""normal"" reactions from other people are just not likely to happen when interacting with a narcissist.

PTSD,"Post the lyrics here of songs that speak to you about your experiences, or that make you think the singer experienced something like we have...",DrLamLam
PTSD,"I was rewatching this episode and it occurred to me: the likely reason that Annorax couldn't fix the mistake he made (that resulted in the loss of his wife) was that his ship was in a state of temporal flux and at least ONE element (Annorax himself) was always remaining outside the calculation when it should be part of it. Even if he was the only person on the ship, he still would be unable to restore the Krenim timeline.

Consider: when the crew of Voyager developed temporal shielding, the ship was no longer an ""inert component"" and messed up Annorax's calculations so badly that the Krenim Imperium reverted to a pre-warp state.

This suggests that everything needs to be part of the calculation, or else it won't work. Now, putting aside the fact that nobody, not even Annorax, could actually ever calculate *all* the variables, having someone shielded means they aren't affected, and so whatever effect they would have on the timeline is taken out of the equation.

The question is: could this ever be accounted for in a calculation?

My hypothesis is (from my, you know, completely non-temporal-physical perspective) that because Annorax took himself (and his own crew) out of the equation, whatever effect he'd have on the Krenim timeline is removed from the calculations and therefore he could never put the Krenim timeline back to the original *because* the closest he could ever get is a timeline without his non-shielded, original effect on people, places and things. By taking himself out of the calculations, it could be as simple as his wife never meets him, gets run over by a vehicle because she doesn't stop to talk to him, and thus in his ""present"" she doesn't exist as his wife. But the bottom line remains, as long as he's not affected by his own calculations, he cannot actually restore the Krenim timeline 100%.

I'd imagine that he went crazy enough that he didn't realise this, became so desperate that he didn't realise that he could never fix it because of the very fact that he was trying to fix it.

The consequence of this interpretation is, though, that like another poster said, the Voyager crew that departed in escape pods (presumably with temporal shielding) would not have been affected by the reset. This would then mean that the reset wouldn't work correctly: those people's influence on the timeline would be removed, therefore they would not only not reappear on Voyager, but that should totally mess up everything because they wouldn't have joined Voyager, or Starfleet, or been born...

What are your thoughts? Any theories on how Annorax *could* restore the Krenim timeline?",DrLamLam

I just wanted to share with everybody that I've created a new subreddit, /r/NarcissisticAbuse , for people who experience abuse at the hands of narcissists who are not parents. You may also have narcissistic parent(s)/family member(s), or just have some support/resources you want to give.

As a person abused by two narcissists in two separate relationships, I came here but wasn't quite sure that this sub was geared to *my* specific needs so I thought, what the hey, I'll make one and share with you guys! You might've noticed the sub listed in your sidebar, and I just wanted to take a moment to introduce it more formally. That said, I certainly have found relevant things all the same (podcast on Co-Narcissism comes to mind, it's cross-applicable!), so thank you.

It's still under construction (as you'll see in our sidebar) and I've cross-posted some of the amazing things you all have posted here (and linking back to this subreddit), but I'm hoping the subreddit will grow as a space where people can share stories, get support, and share/find resources to understand and deal with the narcissists in our lives.

Thanks for reading and I hope to see you there and that you feel comfortable contributing, if it speaks to you!

If you have any development ideas for the sub, would like to be a mod, or just in general comments you may have for me, please don't hesitate to contact me or /u/Greay66, the other mod we have currently (and someone I have known for 11 years and trust deeply, who has sadly experienced much of what I have experienced at the hands of narcissists).

Some are not true, this one is. I dont know his name, his age, his height or weight. Im even starting to blur out his face. But I see him every single night. He usually talks to me but words do not come out. I just see the two red dots on his shirt. At first Im confused. That was a three round burst. But then I understand, I didnt miss. It doesnt matter what shit hole I was in, It doesnt matter what combat zone it was. I just keep telling my self it was me or him, my patients or him. I have never told this story except for maybe 3 people outside the military. Even the military has no record of this and I have no proof. But I am alive today because its true.
     I was a Medic, one of our creeds is to save lives. I saved many lives, in fact  I never lost a patient, ""permanently"". Many died, but I brought them back. -I dont see their faces when I close my eyes.
     He wanted to see me again last night. But I have a new friend that helps me not see him. Diazepam. 2 pills and I dont see the dots of red, I dont see his baggy clothes, I dont see the AK-47 coming around to point at me. 2 Pills and I can sleep. I wonder what 4 pills can do? Thats for another day.
     I will not see him tonight though, he scared me last night and I dont want him back. If I could do it all over again, I would still have joined the Army, I would have gone over seas, I would definitely HAVE been a Medic. But I probably would have been sick that day, just one day. Me being sick that one day would have prevented alot of these internal problems. The ones that ""are in my head"", or ""the ones Im faking"" yes VA doctor I heard you. What would be so bad if I was sick that summer day. Maybe I wouldnt have PTSD. Then I think they would have just sent another medic. 
     But if they sent someone else, maybe they wouldnt have seen the glint of sunlight. Maybe they wouldnt have moved fast enough, maybe they wouldnt be here now because they would have two dots on their chest instead of him. I try to think of the positives. I wish I didnt have these problems, but Im glad someone else didnt get them because of me.

Sometimes i think all the anxiety is not worth it, and id rather just give up on a normal life, and go to jail, if i could just get revenge.

PTSD,"Ladies and gentleman of Reddit. With the internet today, the media, and so many people being alive and living in big cities, we get to see much more people than our ancestors ever did. As humans we like to admire the beautiful people in our society. Since I was a kid, I been 'mirin all the beautiful women I can on this earth, and what an experience it's been. From the crowded city streets, to the great open internet, and even the television, i thought i'd seen it all. I'm sure everybody has a certain standard of beauty in their heads. Even with this standard, I've never known any one of my friends nor me to see someone who was a perfect 10. That level in our mind, where we see no perceivable flaw. Nothing besides pure ecstasy.

Today i saw someone that blew my mind. I swear to you, it changed how i look at women forever. We have access to the most beautiful people the world has to offer today, models, singers, and all sorts of people paid to look gorgeous and still no one has even come close to this girl i saw today. It's just my taste after all, but still if my scale was a 1-10 before, she upped it to at least a 16-17. I probably sound like a creep but i don't care. In my life, I thought I'd never get to see a person so magnificent they completely break the scale, crushing it to smithereens, but it is an eye-opening experience and truly humbling. The closest way i could put it would be like seeing a completely new color on a whole other light spectrum. Your eyes wouldn't know how to make sense of it. I thought that only in movies, a guy can see a girl, that literally makes his heart skip a beat. Things go silent. I thought that was an exaggeration but it's not at all. It's very real. The best thing is, i got to talk to her. She had a great personality too.

My friends, if you are ever blessed to see someone like this, just take a moment to admire, not in a creepy way, but a mental snapshot, because it is unlikely you will ever see something like this again. I seriously regret only making small talk. I'm relatively young, but I never understood how a woman can have complete control over a man, so that they would spend all their money on her, shower her with gifts, and do anything and everything for her that she wishes, but now i seriously understand. I'm sure this is not love, but every 60's Motown song I've ever heard makes perfect sense to me now. Their are people out there, that with their looks can literally put a spell on you, so that you wouldn't be able to control yourself. Well, I seriously feel at peace with the world right now, and i can die happy. Bless you all, and have a great New Year folks. May i be blessed to see her again one day.",Pumpernickelfritz

PTSD,"I was raised in a christian household where forgiveness was a big part of our religion. Basically we were supposed to follow in Jesus footsteps in regard to forgiving others. That means like Jesus we were to turn the other cheek when abused. Also, there's a scripture always said to forgive your brother 77 times, which was supposedly a metaphor to infinitely forgive your brother, although i disagree with that meaning. I found though, this rule of forgiveness was seldom followed. As i grew up, and experienced untold abuse, i eventually realized the stupidity of religious organizations and left. Apart from religion i do realize forgiveness can have some practical value.

In life, it's been very hard for me to feel ill-will towards people who act like dicks in life towards me. My bible training as a child always makes me feel guilty for being angry or holding any type of grudge towards people that even continually disrespect me. I have no problem defending myself in an aggressive manner, but it's only a show.

Lately this has been affecting me alot, because i can't bring myself to hate the people who've actually physically and emotionally hurt me, specifically those who don't care and refuse to apologize. I will endure their bullshit, then laugh and joke with them, and feel stupid that i am like this. I used to think forgiveness was a good thing, but i'm feeling like it needs very strict limits. I think hate can be a good thing, because the feeling of hate validates the situation in a way, and gives yourself esteem.

PTSD,"I feel like Frank Ocean had such an impact on music, but r&b especially, when he dropped CO. Frank showed how effective a simple and melodic ballad can be in r&b, and produced such a catchy yet unique sounding album full of live instrumentation, and warming synths. His music wasn't just about sex, hoes, and hoppin in the whip with hoes, but it had detailed real life stories in it, and he was able to touch on many topics like, aliens, anime, and the occasional trip through the jungle with tigers, and vengeful armies chasing him. That is something that was and still is rare in r&b. At the end of the day, his sexuality had nothing to do with his talent, which was on full display. His style sent ripples through the stagnant r&b category, and many artists soon followed suit, trading the old 90's style for something more experimental and new. Let's pray that Frank stays true to his roots with his new album.",Pumpernickelfritz

PTSD,"I got increasingly sick from the age of 12-19. Just turned 22 yesterday. It started with me feeling fatigued, in pain and sad at times. Not too bad, but bad enough i asked my father for help. He told me no, i shouldn't get help when i was 12. I listened and lost everything all the while believing i was mentally and physically ill. I started to get increasingly ill, (passing out in the street, vomiting all the time, nausea, vison problems, rashes, all types of mental problems. Everything you could think of. Meanwhile i kept it all to myself, and just one friend i had, until at 16 my life was spiraling out of control w drugs and liquor. My mind and mental state ..... Very bad, i tried to take my life and failed. This goes on until 19 when i pass out in the street again, but this time i beg to go to a doctor. When i get there my doctor tells me i was dehydrated and the answer is simple. I dont believe it, but sure enough he was right. And overnight just like that all the illness i had been dealing with goes away. You probably think im making this up, or im crazy, just like my family, despite listening and seeing what the doctor said. Or maybe my friends who i could never say me being dehydrated was the cause of this illness, that put me in the hospital, caused me to lose everything i loved. But it's true. Not making it up. My brother by my 6 years whom i look up to thinks im a liar, and insane. my mother has convinced everyone im bipolar, and will switch back to my old self although its been two years. I get called crazy everyday, life in shambles, job situation shaky, friends all gone. But you know what? I have my health. And im only 22, i'm behind in some aspects of life, like college and a good social life, but i couldnt help what happened. Fuck anyone against me, all the hate and lies. I will survive and be successful. Life gave me a good fucking kicking, but fortunately it didn't take my life when it easily could've. I got another chance.

PTSD,"I've had some very good friends since i was young who were my age. I was blessed to have good people to hang out with. Here's kind of the problem though, that i'm looking for advice as to why, and how to improve it. 


My friends with whom i had the best time with, where we just clicked and laughed the whole time, were people who were mostly home-bodied, which is in extreme opposition to me. I cannot sit still. I have other friends who are like me, but it just isn't the same. 


The crazy thing is, my best friends who i have the best time with, will start blowing my phone up when i leave them alone, and they start getting bored. I'm like, why can't you just be like that more. So i end up, doing alot of things myself, or hanging out with people i dont like as much. 
I kind of told my friend one time, but it's weird because we're guys. 


I guess guys are expected to just take everything easy, and not care. But this bothers me. He just kind of blew me off. It's been this way since i was a little kid. We have a big circle of friends, and i notice they don't hang out with him much either, unless they hit'em up.


We are all busy and are working or college, so lately the friendship has been deteriorating. But we do live across the street from each other. Honestly i just want to scrap the relationship. It would involve denying myself very great experiences and laughter. What should i do? I am very clearly more concerned about this than him.

 She's coughing, coughing. Okay mom, i get it, the food is really stuck in your throat. Mom, stop being so dramatic. Oh shit, she's really choking. I run into the kitchen and try to perform the Heimlich maneuver although i don't know the correct way. I thrust my fists into her stomach from behind. She's looking even worse and her face is turning red now, with tears. I'm slapping her on her back panicking. She's still gasping for air, now grimacing in pain. Damnit, i'm killing her even more.


Finally i do whatever shitty version of the Heimlich maneuver i've seen on t.v. once more and she begins to throw up and run to the bathroom. Disaster averted, she survived.

TLDR: Mom almost chokes to death on tacos, and i nearly let her die because i have no knowledge of how to save a choking victim. Take a course bros.

If i am alone around another person back at home, i freak out a bit. Being around some people give me tremendous anxiety, and some none at all. I am a very social person, and still love to socialize. It's like i have a strong desire to be around other people even though i have anxiety.


This all occurred after some trauma that happened to me, so i don't know if it's more along the lines of ptsd. I'm going to seek a therapist soon. This is also the weirdest thing.

PTSD,"My family is religous af and violent af. My father beat the shit out of me when i was younger because i wouldnt follow religous rules, among other things. He put me in the hospital multiple times with serious injuries like bruising, scars, busted eardrum. At his church he's revered as a god so me and my brother just put up with it.


My brother is 6 years older than me but we were very close because of the hate. A long time ago when i was 12, i got pretty sick. It was just dehydration though as i was an avid athlete, but i didnt realize at the time. He literally **refused** to take me, and told me i was sick because i was sinning. Everytime i got sick i just dealt with it, or assumed it was because i was sinning. Just so you know dehydration is serious af if you don't understand you are, and it continues happening to you. 


FF to 19, after dislocating my shoulders, fucking up my knee, numerous, mental, emotional, and physical problems i decide to speak up and tell a doctor to have him tell me i was just dehydrated.The tipping point was when i passed out in the street from a near heat stroke. Instantly healed the next day.


 I knew my father was bullshitting after sometime, and i can't really tell you why i didn't try to find out sooner, probably just scared. Anyway, since i was 12, my family completely turned on me when they learned i was sick. My brother whom i loved, attacked me, beat me up. I had to fight often. My parents wouldn't speak to me, called me Satan and possessed, continued beating the shit out of me, all the while i was sick af. When i stopped going to the church they said i was crazy to all my friends. After i graduated i was too sick to complete my internship i worked so hard for so i settled for shitty jobs, but always still worked.


When i found out i was never really sick and had no disease, or no mental illness, or spirtual illness, i flipped my shit. And cursed my pops out i wanted to kill him. I know i was wrong, but i suffered unbelievably for 7 years. They also kicked me out while i was sick, because i was too sick to help with all the chores. After it was discovered what really happened, they called me a liar, despite clear proof. I now have a good paying job, and stopped going to church. My father got sick, and my mother too, unfortunately, and my family wants me to forgive them, although they claim they did nothing wrong, although laughing about it numerous times.


I may sound grimy but part of doesn't care if they suffer or die. The only person i feel sorry for is my brother who was abused also, but he's been completely brainwashed. He moved out, and wants to have a relationship with me. I am disgusted by their presence at times, and will leave them sick soon in this god forsaken neighborhood. Am i wrong?

PTSD,"     Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. 

     Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians.

Edit 1: Okay u/scottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, i changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug.

Edit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music i like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love](  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkW636B8xg) one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YoasUjXBkm8_____). That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzzv6Ks9nc). REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain.

Edit 3: u/glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole 'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James.

PTSD,"     I was someone who experienced both sides of the coin. My personality has always been to be a leader of sorts, and on top of that i was raised in a pretty religous household, so i lived completely differently than most. Everything that normal kids did it was drilled into me to do the opposite. Of course i was still following the religion, and who set those rules, but on a general scale we were the minority. Every fad, or trendy thing going on, i was not allowed to be a part of, and although i liked those things, under threat of dejection, basically i just stopped caring about those things.

     Some pretty bad things happened to me when i was a teen in the name of religion and i saw things in a new light, so i dropped religion and started embracing a normal way of life. All these things i was never a part of and had little to no interest in, social media, the latest music, fashion, gaming, vices, everything, i began to see it from a new perspective and love it. I was able to connect with people in ways i never imagined. It's been popular for some time to tell kids to be different and, don't follow the crowd, but being part of the crowd is so much fun! If people won't accept you because you can't help being different that is one thing. Love yourself amd do you. But if you can fit in, do it! The path of being different can be lonely and isolating. Things you may think are stupid that everybody is doing, try it! It doesn't matter if it is, but what matters is your part of something bigger than you!

PTSD,"I do believe people should be treated with decency, but i don't know about complete equality. First off, i don't think that any two people are exactly equal so any act act of equality is really a false show of compassion, although we are all imperfect. Those who are in control and in power are there for a reason. They may be primarily of a certain race, or a certain gender, but that wasn't by accident. If the weak are allowed to take control of the steering wheel by a helping hand, sure everyone will applaud you and say what a good thing you've done at first. But, if that person doesn't know what they're doing they can take other people's lives including their own. 

     Man has done horrible things in the name of dominance, but the act of letting everyone dominate can be far worse. Some people were just meant to lose. If you want to win, you have to fight and claw your way to the top. If you are not strong enough, it is a sad thing but find comfort where you're at. In nature the lion doesn't pity the hyena, or cheetah if it cannot feed itself. Say the lion sais here, share my meal and ends up starving. The whole food chain will fall into disarray.

Edit: Please remember i also mentioned equal treatment.

Edit 2: People are bringing up times where people fought for their rights and somewhat seized control. However the people in power deemed still had to allow them though.

Edit 4: I have shown the cost in response to comments, such as what would happen if America were never built through violence and revolution, workplace success where inadequate leaders are replaced eventually through self destruction or revolt, etc. I can give more examples.

PTSD,"After a brutal revolution, the United Mexican State is overthrew and thus the United Mexican Social Republic. It sparks up a new Cold War threat to America, not just Cuba anymore. They manage to get many supplies from CCCP and such as Cuba in our timeline, build up their army. America gets pressured to deal with them, and invades Mexico, but Grenada (in my timeline here, grenada isn't attacked) and Cuba and the Warsaw pact sends men and supplies, almost sparking a third word war.

PTSD,"Hi all. I have a question. I feel like I am being a bit mean to my NDad by cutting off communication with him. The most recent situation is this. A few weeks ago I sent him an email with included the following word ""perpetrator"" made made a reference to the pain of slavery being passed through generations to demonstrate how his responses could be a result of trauma in his childhood. My father took this email completely out of context (big surprise) and the following situation happened. 

I made a status update on facebook about being too scared to leave the house for fear that another perpetrator would harass me. Usually I make all of my facebook posts blocked from my NParents because of them commenting on them (tried unfriending them and that raised a huge amount of conflict). My NMom randomly calls me and starts grilling me about why I referred to my dad as a perpetrator and refused to accept that I did not want to discuss this with her and that she was rescuing my dad and being unsupportive. My NDad then writes me an email stating how much it hurt him to be referred to as such and how I was lumping him into the same category of those who attacked me (ignoring the emotional abuse and control he still inflicts) and that I should forgive him and not think of him as ""something evil"". I respond back stating that he should not contact me via email and receive a snarky response back about how I should continue to study christian principles. 

The question becomes, am I being too harsh or am I letting him garner more power. At least this ""explanatory note"" was less vile than the others he's sent in the recent past. I do not know how to live independently of these folks and my ways of protecting myself are not respected. Any advice is helpful ",AnnaBreit
PTSD,"Hi all...I need some advice. I am in recovery from PTSD and co-occuring addictions and as the fog lifts more memories of repressed traumas are beginning surface. With the onslaught of these memories, my level of functioning has declined to the point that it is hard for me to even cook a meal for myself, for going to the grochery store is too overwhelming. For many years, my coping strategy was to take one job after another for as soon as I would take a job I would quickly become overwhelmed, engage in my addictions, lose focus, become depressed, and get fired. This most recent termination is what highlighted this self destructive pattern and brought me into recovery. 

Anyways...thearpists have suggested that I get a part-time job to help me cope as I go through this recovery process. I am at the point that I am applying for disablity since my ability to work anything more than a few hours a week is essentially shot for the next few years. However, I am petrified of even volunteering for a few hours a week, and fear that I will fuck up again and get terminated or become overwhelmed and let people down with my primal coping mechanism of numbing out. The problem with this is that my life currently exists of sleep, thearpy group, and 12 step meetings. I can't make myself do even the simplest self care activities and will pretty much only do things if there is an extreme level of accountability involved or a complusive need to find out more information on trying to understand my trauma, justify my level of disability, and consistently retraumatize myself and ruminate on events of the past. Essentially, I've never felt safe and stable and am subconsciously doing everything possible to sabatoge my recovery and pushing away friends and my life in the process. For so many years, my life was defined by escaping my trauma through engaging in addictions, taking on the likes and dislikes of those around me, and pleasing my perpatrators to avoid repercussions, leaving me with no identity and little understanding of what I need to be happy.  This pattern and the inevitability of relying on disability and the services of social services organizations has shattered my already extremely low self esteem. Does anyone have any advice on how to help me refind my purpose? ",AnnaBreit
PTSD,"Hi all...the other day I had yet another mental health professional suggest that I have BPD. While I don't have an official diagnosis, I have significant childhood emotional trauma (bullying, friend abandonment, emotional abuse by my father and mother, etc) and several other axis 1 diagonsis.  The prospect of this diagonsis both terrifies me and provides a sense of relief. One one hand it may makes it easier for me to get services and disability (I have a very terrible work history), on the other hand I feel like it pigeonholes and stigmatizes me, while dooming me to a life of institutionalization and community services.

My question is...what have you done to heal from BPD and how long did the healing process take? I know DBT is the gold standard, but else has helped you? Also, has anyone on here recieved services from nonprofits working with those with severe mental illness? 

Any advice helps ",AnnaBreit

PTSD,"Hi all... I am experiencing a weird symptom that I have just now become aware of. Whenever I try to relax my body and face jerks itself awake. This happens during hypnosis, meditation, and whenever I try to fall asleep. I'm also beginning to wonder if it happens when I am not aware of it because I have a hard time waking up and am consistently tired. I do take trazadone to help me sleep, but its so hard to wakeup from and has done nothing to make me feel more rested. I also have consistently tight muscles that at times result in some serious pain. Does anyone else experience this symptom and if so, what meds, techniques, etc, have you found that helped? I think lately they've been triggered by sleeping in the same bed and the same apartment as several traumas, seeing a perp who does not get the fact I want nothing to do with him, and fear of retaliation from confronting this perp and having him evicted. ",AnnaBreit
PTSD,"Hi all. I am beginning the intense recovery process from CPTSD that has occurred from several events throughout my childhood and young adulthood. Often times, I find myself trapped in a victim mentality with a strong sense of both conscious and unconscious learned helplessness and conversely intense perfectionism which often results in the sabotage of jobs, relationships, friendships, and hobbies. Due to intense codependency issues I have very little self esteem and virtually no idea of what I want, need, and value. I recently lost yet another job and sit around spending most of the day reading about the effects of PTSD and codependency on one's life. My question is...for those of you in recovery...what has it taken you to come to terms with your trauma and move from feeling completely victimized, scared, empty, chaotic, helpless and unable to function to being able to be feel whole, successful, peaceful, and done with the effects of your past.

PTSD,"Hi there. I was wondering if there was a support group (online or otherwise) for the siblings and daughters of those growing up in a household with eating disorders. While I've had my own personal struggles with food (mostly compulsive overeating with occasional bulimia) both my mother and sister struggled for years with disordered eating and body image and we grew up in a household where being fat was a fate worse than death. I recently begin my own recovery from love addition and codependency and learned that growing up in a household where eating disorders are present is very similar to growing up in a house with a parent and/or sibling who is a substance abuser. Despite the events and trauma of this experience, I have found very few resources to help me overcome this experience other than treatment for my own C-PTSD (the ED's in the house are just one of the many wonderful things that happened to me), ADHD, and pervasive depression. What resources are available usually are tailored towards the parents of those suffering and/or recovering from ED's with very little attention paid to what happens when your parent (s) and/or sibling have an ED. Any advice and/or help is appreciated. I've been dealing with the after affects of this for a very long time and am just now coming to realize how incredibly disfunctional my family was growing up, in part due to ED's. ",AnnaBreit

PTSD,"Does anyone here have a strong desire to consistently try and fix toxic people and contextualize their behavior in terms of their own mental illness and addiction problems? I am consistently doing this. Case in point, a neighbor who I was initially attracted to just violated my trust for the second time in about as many weeks. Despite my friends suggestions that he is a toxic person and should be removed from my life, I contextualized his behavior (lying, using me for weed, booze, and food, manuplating my words to justify his point, stealing small amounts of money from me, leading me on through excessive flirting, etc) as the behavior of an addict in need of assistance and was empathic and kind instead of being angry and dismissive. I always seem to find the good things about the person and ignore this anti-social and disrespectful behavior.  This is a consistent pattern in my relationships, always justifying bad and disrespectful behavior. The question is, when is this healthy and when do I need to just give up and admit this person is toxic and remove them from my life? And also, is this a result of my reaction to trauma? ",AnnaBreit
PTSD,"Hi all, I am beginning to investigate the process of declaring bankruptcy as a way to start over and reestablish my financial future. Currently most of my cards are in consolidation but I can no longer afford the $471 consolidation payment on top of the minimum payment on my open (and maxed out) cards. Despite all of my cards being current, a pretty good on time payment history (maybe 3 late payments over the course of 7 years of having credit) I still have a credit score below 600 due to high balances and crazy high student loans. As it stands I have no savings and am living paycheck to paycheck because over 35% of my income goes to credit card payments and has been for a long time. I know I've made a ton of financial mistakes over the past several years and kinda feel like I need to face the consequences for my actions. 

My questions are this...My parents are a cosigner on a private student loan that is current and in good standing. I under no circumstances want them to find out about me doing this because they would probally disown me. When I discussed this with them earlier they tried to manipulate me into not going through with it by stating they would stop paying my phone bill (I have no money to do this on my own and need my phone). Would this loan be touched in bankruptcy procedings? 

Also, I recently started a new job with an employer that has a mandated contribution to a pension of 10% of my income (the reason why I can no longer afford these bills). Would this pension be touched or would my employer be notified of my financial situation? Thanks

PTSD,"Hi all...I have a question, specificly for women. What have you done to develop your self worth, post abuse? For as long as I can remember I've sought out external validation in order to develop my own feelings of attractiveness and desirability to others as a friend, collegue, and romantic partner. This pattern has led to many failed friendships, countless unhealthy codependent relationships, and job terminations due to performance anxiety and the inability to separate my personal life from my professional life. Most recently I am dealing with falling quickly for a neighbor only to have him completely take advantage of me. When this happened I kept thinking to myself I guess there is no one I like that likes me back. To provide a bit of context...I was bullied relentlessly throughout school for my physical appearance and personality type (I am a super intense, aggressive person with ADHD not diagonsed and treated till I was 18), was made to feel ugly and inadaqute by my over achieving father, mother who had an eating disorder, and my sister who I feel has a personality disorder. When I was 20 I was sexually assaulted after being heartbroken by a guy I became obessed with (this happened in the same day), was used for sex by many men throughout college, and recently ended an emotionally abusive relationship by moving 1000 miles away from everything I've known for the past 4 years. In the process of all of this I tried to validate myself through purchasing clothes and makeup to the tune of $18,000 in credit card debt accrued over a year that I can't pay. The one positive to this is that I have finally achieved a professional goal, but had to move 1000 miles away in order to do it and have subsequently gotten myself re-engaged in drama with an asshat within the first 2 months of being here. So...my self worth is in the shitter and I don't know how to stop this distructive pattern of validating my desirability to others through their attention and misguided affection. ",AnnaBreit

PTSD,"So...I recently moved across the country to begin the job I've worked my ass off for 5 years to achieve. In the process, the move game me to courage to leave, what I now know was an abusive relationship. I had limited contact with this person and they decided to block me on facebook after I messaged them asking them to take down pictures (Friday) fast forward till yesterday when they then decide to try and refriend me. The mere thought of them being back in my life triggered almost a full on panic attack, a call to the women's resource center, a vague disclosure to my boss about what is going on, and an appointment with the employee psychological assistance center. 

What is odd...is that not an hour after this event occurred I started experiencing extreme pain and muscle stiffness along with incessant panic. This pain (now combined with digestive issues) has transformed into general lethargy and I ended up calling my boss and was an hour late to work this morning (I've been there for less than a month and am still on probation). After sleeping in the pain was getting better until my friend made a post of facebook about being reminded about a deceased ex's bday (I have signifigant unresolved grief regarding an ex who committed sucide in 2010) and another friend inquired about my vague facebook posts. 

I'm just upset that I've let this disease and my abuser (and everyone that hurt me prior) take this much control over me. 

Also, I know this pain is a symptom of PTSD (only took $1000 of massage, chiropractic, and nuerological care as well as getting fired from my job due to missing too much work) to figure this out. I just can't place myself in the same situation I was a year ago. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this physical pain go away? I am qualified for a medical card here, which would help, but oftentimes weed makes me freak out and intensifies the panic. 

I just want to fucking live my life. ",AnnaBreit

PTSD,"Hi all. I need your advice. In 2012 I moved to Madison, WI for two reasons 1) To live with a man I was dating at the time who had a cushy job there and 2) To find employment in the local foods/food systems planning community. The man and I are no longer together for various reasons and while I created a great network of those involved in food issues in Madison, I never found employment in the field. While in town I took a job at an agency serving those on TANF that had recently received a grant to expand their program from 10 counties to 80 counties in less than four months. Needless to say this transition was very chaotic for everyone involved and as an administrative position I was expected to teach those who knew nothing about the program how to run it while not knowing anything myself (I'm from Ohio, not Wisconsin so I didn't even know the history or politics behind the program). Everyone on my team was new and I was the youngest person there. Suddenly I was supposed to be a leader without knowing what the hell I was doing. 

While the job itself was chaotic, I felt bullied by my boss and indirect coworkers all while undergoing an unraveling relationship at home in a city where I knew no one. I had taken the job because I needed money and the salary was decent (by social worker standards at least). It had absolutely nothing to do with food work, one of the reasons I came to the city in the first place. Being right out of graduate school with little professional experience (other than internships) I was consistently scared of screwing up and doing something wrong so I went to my boss for everything and copied her on every email I sent. While I was being yelled at for doing things I thought I should be doing (and also to keep myself busy during downtimes) my direct coworkers (one of whom was extremely supportive) received consistent praise for their work. This combined with the stress at home, made me extremely depressed and I stopped caring about things like my personal appearance and hygine. The straw was when I asked my boss to provide any feedback she received and she sent me a nasty email about how coworkers were saying I smelled, looked like a slob, and had bad breath (yes the really told my supervisor that). In the midst of all of this I had identified that I wanted to try for a job with less responsibility and a lower salary and had one of the worst interviews for my life. Needless to say I did not get the other position and left the management position soon after the email went out. 

In the two years since leaving this company I have remained in contact with some of those I met in the food community while I lived in Madison, including a professor at UW. Also, I recently learned that the agency I worked for has several openings and recently obtained to a new grant focused on the Food Stamps Employment and Training Program. Also through linkedin searches and the facebook ""people you may know"" function I learned that several of those who caused me problems are now gone, including my former supervisor. 

When I left, I left on good terms and if I remember correctly may have complained about the rollout, but no one in particular. A call to HR confirmed that I am ""definitely eligible for rehire"" and ""encouraged me to apply"". I also have been in recent contact with my professor friend at UW about potential PHD funding, but will not be eligible for admission until 8/2016, so I need something to do till then, if I get in. 

The question becomes this. Does this community think I should apply for the jobs in the FSET program considering they pay well, have upward mobility, and have pretty awesome benefits (things that don't happen in the nonprofit world) and also would allow me to establish Wisconsin residency for graduate school. I am just concerned that the experiences of the past will come to bite me in the ass.

PTSD,"Hi all, I recently consolidated about $16,000 of credit card debt. In the process of consolidation my accounts went 30 days past due because I could not pay the consolidation company (about $450), my active credit cards (aprox $120), and the past due balances. When I signed up with the consolidation company I was given the impression that I would be hit with a 30 day late mark on my credit report and then things would be taken care of. I am now in my third or 4th month of consolidation and my past due balances are still present and the negative reporting continues. I will not have the additional $150 to pay these companies by the 27th (my stupid company does not due direct deposit and by the time the money is in my account it will overdraw it), but feel like this is extremely unfair. In the process my credit score has dropped to 582 and while it has never been very good, its never been this bad. I am scared that I am not going to be able find another apartment due to this, let alone get a school loan.

For instance in college I continued to visit the man who completely took advantage of me sexually (its a complicated reason as to why I will not say he raped me) three times after the incident knowing full well what would happen and still continue to have problems making decisions regarding major life choices without my dad's advice and/or input. While my relationship with my dad has improved, he still is in complete denial about how much of an ass he can be and more importantly was (my sister, who is also mentally ill, going into residential treatment for an eating disorder helped some) and yet I to seek his advice on everything. Complicating this, I get really mad when I bitch about my family and someone agrees with me and try to push people away, particually men, who become too close.

PTSD,"Did anyone on here find the holiday immensely triggering? Last week I traveled home to visit my family for the holidays (giving up a week of pay in the process) only to be screamed at and berated by my sister the vast majority of the time. When I tried to reach out to my parents for support, my dad reminded me how I was mean to him all year (just trying to stand up for myself). On Christmas, I preceded to get drunk and fight with my boyfriend (who was fed up with me and my sister fighting and has anxiety and depression issues of his own) and ended up engaging in self-harming behavior including attempting to throw myself out of the car on our way home. When trying to talk to my parents about these events (I really have no one else to talk to since my best friend is 2000 miles away and I feel that the only friend I have in my home town is pulling away from me), I was told that my being unhappy was a choice and that I should focus on ""being a bigger person"" and I was ""not showing leadership"". I was then reminded about how I ruined Christmas as I became ""obessed with returning a gift that ended up being counterfeit and how my interest in makeup was ""unhealthy"" (similar feelings were expressed for my interest in other things across the years. For years I have pretty much given up on having a relationship with my sister, who I feel has a personality disorder among other axis I dx, but it is coming to the point where I feel like I can no longer speak with my dad as his consistent need to try and control me, play peacemaker between my sister and I, and negaite my c-ptsd, depression, and ADHD is 100% non-therapeutic. 

To make this situation worse, years of untreated C-PTSD and ADHD have led to financial, professional, and personal ruin. I need to move back home where I can reestablish my finances and develop my career with whatever minimal support system I have (my mom is wonderful). However, my vile, mean, and nasty sister still lives at home and has no plan to move out (she's 26) and tries to control every minute of my mom's time, therefore making the prospect of moving back in with my parents daunting. Given this I feel exiled from my childhood home and completely helpless in the face of this situation. Furthermore, my financial situation, position as a temp employee (read no sick days) and currently my insurance's failure to pay for ADHD or depression/anxiety meds has made paying for treatment VERY difficult and dependent on my parents when I need assistance. As most of you know, consistently asking for help from your parents when you are 30 years old is one of the most demoralizing things you can do.

My rental income would be taxable but that would be offset by repairs completed I think.

I don't think this would be considered a gain on the sale because of what I had to pay out of pocket ($1800) and the escrow refund doesn't offset that does it?

I know the kickback for the sale program ($950) will be considered taxable income but I don't see that being too big of a hit.

Am I missing anything? Is this just going to be a wash and I took a loss, or what do you all think I should be expecting?

2. Establish E-Fund
3. Retirement if you don't plan to work forever

And now that I found this infographic today (http://i.imgur.com/WE8M4r6.jpg) I guess I'm wrong...

So can someone please explain to me so that it's clear....

My employed income is $3,208 monthly. (if I became unemployed this would go away)

My disability income is $1,409 monthly. (this won't go away short of a national government failure so... I count it as guaranteed.)

So combined: $4,617 monthly

I have other variable income, but it's not consistent enough to include it.

Expenses.

What do you include here? Everything to include minimum debt payments. Just like we usually list it all out?

If that's the case; $4,300 monthly expenses

So if this is correct; I would need $12,900 for 3 months of e-fund, and $25,800 for 6 months of e-fund.

Am I really supposed to just keep making minimum payments on debt until I have at least the $12,900 saved up?

So... $758.85... well I called the billing office prepared to set up a payment plan. I asked the nice lady who picked up if they offered a discount for full payment. She says they do, 30%. I ask if they can generously offer 40% since it is a full payment indeed. She said they can offer 35% maximum. Okay...

So my $758.85 out of pocket is now $492.62. And I'll take it.

I had a projected wind-fall of back pay for VA Disability I was expecting later this fall, well they worked much faster than I anticipated and I got it today.

Step 2. Choose between the following:

CC 1 - Pay toward balance of $9,968 at 16.4%, $320/month

CC 2 - Pay toward balance of $2,912 at 13.9%, $65/month

The reason I'm even considering CC 2 is because after paying of the loan I will have ~$2100 left, and if I apply that to CC 2 I could have it paid off entirely in the next 4-6 months, freeing up an addtional $65 a month I can put toward CC 1 on top of the extra $180 and the $170 from the loan payment ($415 total), whereas if I put that $2100 toward CC 1, it'll reduce the balance but won't free up the extra $65 to pay it down faster.

PTSD,"So after much deliberation by Jeff he decided to skip the flat lands of Iowa and Nebraska and got a ride out here to Colorado Springs Colorado!

He's been here since Friday 4/10 and will most likely be starting his journey west on Sunday 4/19.

Today, Jeff and Niko are climbing Pikes Peak. They were dropped off at approximately 7:00AM at the Barr Trail trail-head.

His first leg will take him from Colorado Springs to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. I've plotted a ""projected' route which can be found in the [Jeff and Niko](http://imgur.com/a/Xd2GS) album.

You may also follow them on Instagram and Snapchat: Wittko33

His overall journey will take much longer, between 4-5 months. He will be travelling to California and then up the coast to Seattle and taking a ferry to Alaska.

If anyone is along this route and willing to offer a hot shower and a night to stay it could be very needed and would be greatly appreciated. Please PM me to discuss.",SCRIZZLEnetwork

PTSD,"So my ex and I have an auto loan together... 

4.09% and 53 payments left. 

Her attorney told her to attempt to refinance it.

She got a best rate of 9.9% and would need to extend the term back to 60 months to roughly keep the same payment.

The attorney told her that because it's considered to be detrimental to her finances she can draft a letter releasing me from liability and right to the property (the car) and the judge will approve it and they will provide it to the lender who then has to remove me from the title and stop reporting to my credit file, but still maintain the same APR% and payment terms.

She seems to think it will be better for her (and more financially responsible) to refinance it.

PTSD,"So the VA is approving my PTSD at an increase of either 10% or 20% which will net me $6000 or $9000 in back-pay... 

I know what to do with it... pay off debt... but I'm wondering which to choose from.

1 of 5 credit cards - the highest is $9,813.27 @ 16.4% (currently paying $350/month)

or my auto loan, $11,600 @ 16.9% (paying $310/month)

Here are a few precursors... as to what we ""reddit"" already knows that can't be changed at the moment.

My full budget has been previously posted. The car can't just be sold and downgraded because I don't have equity nor cash to buy a new one at the moment. Also, I got hit by another driver so value is likely much lower because of the repair record being on carfax.

So what's up Reddit? What is going to make the biggest difference to me.

1. Sideswiped by another driver, they took 100% fault (same insurance company), but I have to wait until the end of the month to get my car fixed because of the recent storms here, long waiting list at all local shops. 
My cost having insurance, $0. Without insurance, $1000+.

2. My gums got infected between two teeth because of my having an open contact and a piece of food got jammed in there, brushing  & flossing regularly didn't get it out. Ended up needing a crown to fully fix the problem of having the open contact.
My cost having insurance is $100. My cost without insurance $500.

3. My garage door failed to open all of the way and I didn't notice (distracted) and backed in to it causing some damage. 
My cost having insurance is $250 (deductible). My cost without insurance is $750+

PTSD,"So some background [TRIGGER ALERT]... I was deployed to Qatar in 2011. During this time I frequently drove in to the city of Doha and let me tell you, that traffic was horrendous, the worst I've ever been in. Often times, 3 lane roads would be 4-5 lanes, and cars would travel on the medians or along the sides of the road. Also, the bigger your car the more right-of-way you had.

Well one day I was driving along their main road (a 3 lane) and some civilians (2 adults and a child) ran in to the street to cross and a very large truck (think Middle East dumptruck) swerved in their direction instead of away from them and hit them all. The child was crushed by the tire, one adult was somersaulted in to the air, and I don't really know what happened to the third but I know they were hit. 

One of the worst part's about this is that I couldn't stop, I had to keep driving.

When I returned home my friends noted that I was very distant and detached, especially while in the car. During the year after this event I was involved in 4 auto accidents, all which could have been avoided had I only reacted in time, but I would freeze up.

It got so bad in the second year that I couldn't even drive and at one point, I couldn't even be in the car unless I shut my eyes for the entire ride. 

Thankfully I had met a very mentally/emotionally strong woman during that first year, we ended up married and had a child, and with her help I was able to overcome much of my triggers and am now driving again!

STORY DONE

So the real meat of the post. My story is a prime example of non-combat PTSD, but yet so many people don't believe that you can get PTSD unless you were involved with direct combat... WTF?!

non_PTSD,"Каждый год 9 мая происходит одно и то же: одни люди пишут критические тексты о войне и победе, другие стараются этой критики не замечать. В честь 70-летия Великой победы бизнесмен Александр Кнырович – о кастрировано-праздничном изображении событий, которое не может не оскорблять наши «погибшие, замерзшие, замученные миллионы».

«…Советская военщина — самая оголтелая, самая трусливая, самая подлая, самая тупая из всех, какие были до неё на свете. Это она «победила» 1:10. Это она сбросила наш народ, как солому, в огонь — и России не стало, нет и русского народа. То, что было Россией, именуется ныне Нечерноземьем, и всё это заросло бурьяном, а остатки нашего народа убежали в город и превратились в шпану, из деревни ушедшую и в город не пришедшую. Сколько потеряли народа в войну-то? ... Страшно называть истинную цифру, правда? Если назвать, то вместо парадного картуза надо надевать схиму, становиться в День Победы на колени посреди России и просить у своего народа прощение за бездарно «выигранную» войну, в которой врага завалили трупами, утопили в русской крови». (Из писем Виктора Астафьева, писателя, лауреата всего и вся, фронтовика, добровольца, медали-ордена-ранения)

Я праздную… я поздравляю оставшихся 17 000 (11 300 непосредственных участников) белорусских ветеранов, участников войны. Я знаю, что среди них есть и те, кто тихонько сидел в штабе, и сволочи-комиссары и, конечно, настоящие герои. Бог с ними, война и возраст всё списали. Я их поздравляю, спасибо за победу, остальное – их собственный разговор с самими собой.

Но ракета, которая едет по главной улице моей страны, едет прямо по памяти о миллионах погибших, погибших ни за что, просто из-за придури и шизофрении отдельных граждан, едет по моей памяти.


В 1937-1938 годы из пяти первых маршалов Советского Союза трое погибли: Тухачевский, Егоров – расстреляны, Блюхер – умер в тюрьме от пыток. Маршал Буденный выступил с самой большой и резкой речью (на суде), обвинив Тухачевского, Якира и Уборевича во многих смертных грехах, а главное – в государственной измене, выраженной в настойчивых попытках создать крупные танковые соединения за счет сокращения расходов на кавалерию. Как потом нам не хватало этих танков…

Чуть позже, в августе 1941 по приказу того же маршала Будённого в Запорожье сапёрами 157-го полка НКВД был взорван Днепрогэс. В потоках хлынувшей волны погибли солдаты как немецкой, так и Красной армий. Кроме войск и беженцев, в плавнях и береговой зоне погибло множество работавших там людей, местное гражданское население

Около 30 тысяч кадровых офицеров были выгнаны «поганой метлой» в 1937-1938 гг. Сколько потом мы за эту «чистку» заплатили? Каким количеством душ рассчитались? Весь мир празднует окончание Второй Мировой войны – глобального военного конфликта, в котором приняло участие 62 из 73 существовавших на тот момент государств (80% земного шара), воевавших на пяти театрах военных действий (40 государств), погибло около 65 млн человек!

Мы празднуем окончание именно Великой Отечественной. Нам стыдно! Стыдно вспомнить, что именно мы сначала готовили нацистских военных, потом вместе с ними распилили Польшу и Прибалтику, провели торжественный парад по этому случаю в Бресте. Потом попробовали напасть на Финляндию (организовали там «народное правительство», которое сразу признали – ничего не напоминает?), положили там 95 000 собственных граждан (еще 250 000 больных и обмороженных). За это СССР был исключен из Лиги Наций (тогдашней ООН). Стыдно… гордиться нечем за те два года.

Мы пытаемся не помнить о помощи теперешних наших «врагов» – США и Великобритании (к слову – единственная страна, отпахавшая всю войну «от звонка до звонка»). «…Вот сейчас говорят, что союзники никогда нам не помогали… Но ведь нельзя отрицать, что американцы нам гнали столько материалов, без которых мы бы не могли формировать свои резервы и не могли бы продолжать войну. Получили 350 тысяч автомашин, да каких машин!.. У нас не было взрывчатки, пороха. Не было чем снаряжать винтовочные патроны. Американцы по-настоящему выручили нас с порохом, взрывчаткой. А сколько они нам гнали листовой стали. Разве мы могли быстро наладить производство танков, если бы не американская помощь сталью? А сейчас представляют дело так, что у нас всё это было своё в изобилии». (Г.К.Жуков)

«…Когда к нам стали поступать американская тушёнка, комбижир, яичный порошок, мука, другие продукты, какие сразу весомые дополнительные калории получили наши солдаты! И не только солдаты: кое-что перепадало и тылу. Или возьмём поставки автомобилей. Ведь мы получили, насколько помню, с учётом потерь в пути около 400 000 первоклассных по тому времени машин типа «Студебеккер», «Форд», легковые «Виллисы» и амфибии. Вся наша армия фактически оказалась на колёсах, и каких колёсах! В результате повысилась её маневренность и заметно возросли темпы наступления. Без ленд-лиза мы бы наверняка ещё год-полтора лишних провоевали». (А.И. Микоян).

Я помню мерзкие школьные учебники на эту тему… мол помогали, но чуть-чуть, старыми и плохими товарами, и фронт второй открыли слишком поздно. Когда мы бы уже и сами победили. За ленд-лиз мы рассчитались только на рубеже 20-21 веков. Оплатив 7% поставок, без учета инфляции. А потом был «железный занавес» над половиной Европы – мы их освободили, мы же их и не отпустили из наших крепких «любящих, братских» объятий. И 1956 год в Венгрии, и 1968 в Чехословакии, и снова советские танки... А когда чуть-чуть приоткрыли щелочку на Запад, в 1980-х, оказалось, что бывшие побежденные живут гораздо лучше бывших победителей. Горькие итоги победы.

Голодные солдаты в сырой землянке мечтали: «вот победим Гитлера, вернемся назад, а там – колхозы отменили, я точно слышал!» 

Никто ничего не отменил… И освобожденные наши пленные поехали уже в Сибирь, в наши лагеря. Как предатели. Эшелонами. Великая война, великая победа.

Знамя победы было впервые водружено над рейхстагом бойцами Егоровым, Кантария и Берестом. Гражданина Береста потом потихоньку вычеркнули из истории, он стал зеком, случайно погиб под колесами поезда в 1970 году, спасая чужого ребенка. Знамен было несколько, одна из фотографий, пошедших потом в печать и приобретшая широкую известность (знамя №5, установленное 2.05.1945) отретуширована – были добавлены грозовые облака, для подчёркивания драматизма момента. Знамя изменили, чтобы оно было более красным. Также были заретушированы вторые часы Абдулхакима Исмаилова, который поддерживал Алексея Ковалёва, водружающего флаг. В редакции посчитали, что это может послужить основанием для обвинения в мародёрстве, и фотограф перед публикацией удалил одни часы при помощи иглы.

Каждый год 9 мая у меня ощущение, что мы празднуем какую-то сильно «отретушированную» победу. Как будто не было всего этого ужаса, грязи, крови. Не было всего предшествующего и последующего.

Еще чуть-чуть, и уйдут последние ветераны, и сотрется память, и война превратится то ли в очередной комикс компании Marvel, то ли в мыльную оперу, годную к показу в дневное время на федеральном канале. Я понимаю, что это нужно… детям, лет до 15, вот такое кастрировано-праздничное изображение событий. Но мы то, в большинстве своем – давно уже взрослые люди. Если бы увидели вот это бряцанье нашим оружием на площадях наши погибшие, замерзшие, замученные миллионы – чтобы они сказали нам? Проехались бы с нами на тракторе, должном символизировать наши послевоенные успехи, а символизирующем тупиковость нашей экономической модели? Или сплясали бы с нами под кривое и фанерное исполнение военных песен, в современной обработке, нашими, прости господи, артистами?

Думаю, поотрывали бы руки-ноги всем, кто эту дрянь придумал и сказали бы: «Никогда больше! Не угрожайте никому! Не ссорьтесь ни с кем! Будьте умнее, образованнее, терпеливее!

non_PTSD,"For now Reddit returns 403 for URLs that was blocked for people in some countries. This is very bad, it looks like a server error and user has no clue that content he wanted to see was censored.

I suggest replacing that 403 error with an explanation why this page was blocked and instruction on how user can circumvent internet censorship. Some tips on using Tor, VPN, or at least link to some manual.

This is fully legal in both Russia and Germany, and anywhere, except China, Iran and maybe some other countries that hate free speech much more than those. You can't get your website blocked for having such page.

1) Делаешь взвесь в стерильной воде из аптеки, соскребая сухой иглой часть спор с принта в ампулу, затем это вбирается в шприц. Стерильность на уровне: помыть руки с мылом и делать все быстро. Лежать взвесь должна в холодильнике, примерно столько, сколько ты будешь стерилизовать зерно, т.е. несколько дней.

2) Зерно варится как для людей, затем засыпается в контейнер, который выдержит кипящую воду, объемом хотя бы 300 миллилитров. На его дно лучше насыпать вермика. Зерно надо либо подсушить (перед этим тщательно промыть), либо перемешать с вермиком до рассыпчатого состояния. Контейнер закрывается обычной пищевой пленкой в один слой. В пленке надо сделать дырочку (иглой), на нее класть ватный диск. После стерилизации ватку надо заменить на сухую. Стерилизовать надо 2-3 раза с перерывом в 1-3 дня. После последней стерилизации и остывания контейнера следует приклеить сухую ватку к пленке, например ПВА.

3) Ввести в ватку шприц со взвесью под очень острым углом, впрыснуть небольшое количество взвеси (на все контейнеры ~ 1/3 шприца). Сразу перетряхнуть контейнер так, чтобы перемешать верхнии слои. Во взвесь добрать воды до начального объема и опять положить в холодильник - можно использовать еще минимум пару месяцев.

4) Ставим контейнеры в шкаф и забываем на 3-4 дня. Если плесневеют - выкидываем содержимое и по-новой.

5) После полного обрастания либо ставим контейнер как есть прямо в пластиковый ящик-парник (но стенки контейнера надо сделать непрозрачными), либо вынимаем содержимое и кладем в тот же ящик на какую-нибудь крышечку. На дно парника следует насыпать керамзит. Открывать и опрыскивать водой 1-2 раза в день из обычного пуливилизатора, можно попадать водой на мицелий (но не стоит, лучше лить воду в керамзит - сама испарится). Ждать урожая от одной до пяти недель.

Merc limits are set based on trade zones. So, for example the Constantinople trade node might have 20k mercs available to any country that has a core in that zone. Anyone with a core can hire them and it excludes those mercs from being hired by other countries.

Mercs have a tech level based on the average tech level of the trade node they're hired from. There's no trading of weapon tech in EU4 which I don't really like but this would at least allow more primative nations to benefit from their aggressive military campaigns. Kind of like how in older versions of civilization, you could salvage tech from places you invaded.

This allows you to hire mercs as part of your overall strategy and denying enemy access can be a big part of that. It also allows militarty tech to be strategically moved around the world a little bit more.

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

My dad has been using laptops for years (despite having taught us how to build desktop computers in our youth) because he just doesn't have the time to put one together and set it up. (He's a EE/programmer/workaholic) So me and my brother set out to build him a good desktop computer with enough horsepower to properly contrast what he's used to, along with enough overhead close any gaps if he feels the need. 

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

Presently the bar is not that high, the most intensive computing he does is AutoCAD and photoshop, but that is partly because he's been limited to the capabilities of consumer laptops, so we think once he has some better hardware that his oldschool gaming instincts will kick in.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Ballpark $1000

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

non_PTSD,"So I've been fooling around with this girl for awhile now and naturally we've cycled through all your standard vanilla kinks and things were starting to wind down a bit. This wasn't a big deal though as neither of us is interested in anything more than casual sex so there's no pressure to keep things fresh and exciting.

That being said, a little bit ago she randomly messaged me saying she has something naughty to share and sends me cellphone footage of her with a vibrator doing some impressive pornography-grade squirting. She goes on to talk about how excited she is for teaching herself how, and we proceed to make plans to explore this further. Next thing I know she's cumming in my face like a chinese firefighter trying to extinguish a burning chemical factory while I'm right there dumping fuel on the flames.

Now, before I get carried away here, I'll just say, I'm a [M] nurse by trade, and I have no delusions about what's really going on. I can tell exactly where her 'juices' are coming from, and I've made peace with the fact that the girl is pissing in my face while I go down on her, no big deal.

So finally, to the point. She's been squirting in my face for a few weeks now and I've gotten enough in my mouth to know how it tastes. The most surprising thing about the experience is the fact that her piss didn't taste at all like I'd thought it would. Ranging from unflavored Gatorade to that bland tea they serve you at oriental restaurants (that you dump sugar packets into). I thought it was a fluke at first, but after repeatedly testing this observation, I'm quite certain that her piss tastes sweet, sometimes blatantly so.

The perverted side of me thought all this was kinky as hell, so I really didn't think on it too much until this morning. I just woke up and had a weird nurse's epiphany about it. Sweet urine. Glucose urine. Glycosuria. Jesus Christ. I'm a fucking dumbass. I race over to my bag where I keep my backup glucometer for work, wake her bleary-eyed ass up, and pricked her finger to check her blood sugar. 441. **Fuck!** Recheck. 453. **Shit!!** Asymptomatic, but hyperglycemic as fuck. She's got the Beetus. Diabetes. I broke the news as gently as I could, which was something to the tune of ""Holy shit fuck! That's some serious fucking diabetes! Call your doctor!"" Hysterics ensued. So now she's out to the doctors office and possibly the urgent care clinic for treatment, and I'm sitting here trying figure out a good cover story for how I knew..

TLDR; TIFU by breaking some bad news to a girl after she ""squirted"" in my face and I diagnosed her with diabetes after realizing her piss was unnaturally sweet.

To bring things current, the girl is doing fine now, they've ran more thorough tests and strongly suspect she's a type 1 diabetic, but it'll take a few days and tests to confirm the preliminary results. She's got a lot on her mind, all I can think about though is how we went from casual fuck buddies to irreversibly connected by the act of getting her piss in my mouth.

Still, the response has been hilariously fantastic. While there's a lot of contention on whether this is a fuck up, I'll just say that a couple factors had stuck out to me personally that framed it like that, such as the fact that it took weeks for me to piece this all together, my majorly panicked reaction to it, and the resulting state of hysteria I had caused after scaring the girl half to death. That all kind of overshadowed the lucky guess I made, in my mind anyway. No longer though! Right now I feel like the fucking **man**, thanks for helping me see the cloud's golden lining!",DaySee

non_PTSD,"Can HIIT be adapted for a realistic lifestyle?

I used to jog almost every day for about 30 mins while keeping track of my heartrate to make sure I wasn't going too slow or too fast and wasting effort.

However, I understand that High-intensity interval is the most time-efficient and has greater overall benefits. I have attempted high intensity interval training in the past, and while it can be faster, the routine was just not sustainable. I just couldn't consistently find the energy/will power to sprint a 100%(or even 75%) on your random monday morning at 6 am.

Has anyone had similar experiences and/or found a simple way balance to it? My general attitude is that you have to find the laziest way to get/stay generally fit or you'll just never be able to sustain it as a lifestyle in the long run and I just can't find a good place for HIIT.",DaySee

So today I had to take my GF to WalMart (don't judge). My car is a 2009 Civic Si, to some of you not important, to me, she's my dream car.

So I always like to park heart healthy (in the back so no one will park near me and ding my car). Today I did the same and as I'm walking towards the store I notice a POS Ford Probe park next to me for no reason. Like seriously, dozens of open spaces and this guy backs in directly next to me. At first I was just pissed because this guy is an asshole. I kept looking back because I'm paranoid and wanted to see if he was gonna hit my car. After about the 6th look back I noticed he wasn't getting out of his car. At this point I was almost in the store.

DING DING DING the alarms in my head go berserk.

I told my gf I wanted to go back to my car. She told me I was being paranoid and kept walking. I turned around and started heading back to my car. I got about halfway back from the store to my car and this car starts up and peels the fuck out of the parking lot. I sprinted back to my car hoping to try and at least get a license number but the best I got was a ""my kid is an honor student at --------"".

I tried to chase but he got a very good lead and I caught every red light.

My gf later suggested that the bumper sticker may be a way to avoid suspicion. Possibly. Scared the hell out of me. Protect your cars gentlemen!",Longbow90

Okay, here we go. A little background about me. I'm young (mid 20's), I'm a guy, I'm white, and I'm a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan (American football). For this of you who aren't familiar with the sport, the Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys have a huge rivalry that has existed for years.
Here's where I fuck up.

So I'm at work (fast food), this day I had decided to wear my favorite Eagles shirt underneath of my uniform because why not. An older black guy walks into the store wearing a Cowboys hat, t-shirt, lanyard, and jacket. Upon seeing him most of my co-workers greeted him with a smile and a hello. I on the other hand, without thinking, greeted this 60 year old black guy with a ""we don't serve your kind here"". It instantly registered to me what I had said when all my co-workers looked at me in disbelief. I also realized that this poor guest couldn't see my t-shirt under my uniform. I instantly began apologizing and explaining. I took my uniform shirt off, showed him my phone background, my credit card, literally anything I could to show him I was trying to make a sports joke and not being a racist little shit.

After about 30 seconds of me explaining he started laughing so hard I thought he was gonna piss himself. Then he told me not worry about, and that he understood. I gave him his food for free. Then the manager wanted to have a little chit-chat. I wasn't fired but I was yelled at pretty well.

So that's the story of how sports made me look racist. ",Longbow90
non_PTSD,"So this happened the other day.

I work at a fast food chain that specializes in chicken so I've seen some ungodly things but this just made my blood boil.

Typical shift, almost over. In walks 3 of the biggest women I have ever seen. Calling them whales feels too modest. Even hamplanet seems too small, but I'll continue. Following these 3 walking medical specials on TLC, is a 4th fatty. Probably half the others size but still large on any scale.

First hammy rolls over to place her order: ""yeh I'll take dem nuggets, 12 of 'em. Also I want 2 chicken samwiches wid extra cheese, 2 large fries, and a large milkshake"" 

""Okay ma'am that will be..."" She interrupts, ""I wadn't done wit da order"" 

>my god why hast thou forsaken me

She proceeds to order another 12 nuggets and a large coke. I won't bore you with the the orders of hammy's 2 and 3 as they were virtually identical to the first one.

Half a planet (smallest girl) gets up to order: ""can I just have a salad with no dressing and a bottle of water?""

>allofmywat

I think I blacked out from shock because I had to ask her to repeat her order, which she did. Salad and water.

For whatever jealous/hateful/spiteful/fatlogic reason, this set the trio of planets off because they immediately start screaming how she's already too thin, telling her to enjoy life, eat whatever. I can see her holding back tears as her ""friends"" berate her in public. 

She was just about to change her order to shut her friends up when I did the only thing I could think of...""it's on me"" I said as I pulled a $10 out and paid for her meal. (Please note this isn't a praise on me, any of you in the same situation would have done the same thing)

>sweetjesuswhathaveidone

The wrath of these fatties turns to me. The words ""enabler"" and ""faggot"" were thrown around quite liberally. Then mini ham did the best thing I've ever seen. She asked me to bag up her order, and when I handed it to her she left. She just walked out. The best part is, when the other realized she was leaving, they all start shouting about her being their ride. It was awesome.

""No way! Absolutely not!"" I joked with my friend Jake. ""Why not? It'll be fun!"" He replied. ""I am absolutely not watching a movie called ""John dies at the end"", spoiler alert, I know what's gonna happen!"" We argue back and forth for 15 minutes in our brand new apartment. Jake and I had been friends since freshman year in college. Now juniors, we finally got our own bachelor pad off campus.

""Supposedly it's a very trippy movie"" he continued ""we'll get some absinthe, and watch it as a drinking game!"" Ahh absinthe...for those of you who don't know, absinthe is an alcoholic drink (like vodka or rum) but supposedly it can make you hallucinate. I still didn't love the idea of watching a stupid movie but when I heard there would be alcohol involved, I agreed.

Jake began to call his brother (we were both 20 and his brother who went to school nearby was 22) to ask him to buy us alcohol. He agreed and told us to meet him in an hour at the liquor store. ""Awesome!"" I said, ""we're getting absinthe and I finally get to meet your brother!"" I was genuinely excited for both. Jake had spoken for years about how cool his older brother was, clearly he looked up to him very much.

Fast forward to the liquor store and I finally see Jake's older brother. I knew right away who it was, they looked like they could be identical twins. ""Hey there, I'm Dave,"" he said as he extended his hand for a handshake. ""Pete"" I said as I met his hand with mine. He then immediately throws Jake into a headlock and starts rubbing his hair. ""How's Chucky doing?"" Dave asked his brother Jake. 

""Chucky?"" I asked. Dave explained how Jake's middle  name was Charles, and how as a kid Dave would tease Jake and eventually it stuck. ""So what do you guys want?"" Dave asked. I blurted out ""absinthe"", maybe too aggressively because Dave began laughing. He then proceeded to make sure that we were sure we wanted it. We confirmed that we did so we gave him some money and Dave comes out a few minutes later with a big bottle of hallucinogenic awesomeness.

We talked for a little while longer and asked Dave if he wanted to come by later. He politely declined and explained that he had plans, but if something changed he'd let us know. We thanked him and then we all left.

""Let's do this!"" Jake yelled as we both threw back a shot. It tasted like peppermint. It was so smooth. ""Ahhh delicious!"" Jake signed into his xbox and pulls up netflix to start ""John dies at the end"". We started by doing a shot every 10 minutes, 50 minutes and 6 shots later (1 before the movie and 5 every 10 minutes) we were absolutely hammered. The fact that we were even awake was nothing short of a miracle.

I really didn't expect to hallucinate. I figured it was just a rumor that everyone pretended to believe to be cool. The combination of that much alcohol plus this very weird and trippy movie pushed me over the edge. The room was spinning, every piece of furniture seemed to bend and distort. I couldn't take it, I stumbled to the bathroom and shoved my fingers down my throat. I couldn't breath, the vomit didn't stop coming, I thought I was going to pass out. Finally, it stopped and I was able to breath again.

The next thing I remember is waking up next to the toilet, still very drunk. I had to check on Jake, if this experience was this bad for me I could only imagine it would be on him as well. I heard him snoring on the couch. I was suddenly very conscious that there was someone else in our apartment, standing over Jake's blacked out body. Was I still hallucinating? ""Hello?"" I squeaked out. I wasn't hallucinating, the figure turned around, moonlight shining on his face. I had no idea who this was, why was he here? How did he get in?

I didn't think too much, I just jumped on him and started punching. He was trying to say something but I didn't care. I was scared, very drunk, and trying to protect my friend. I kept pounding my fists into his face until I couldn't move my arms anymore. I blacked out again.

I awoke to the sound of Jake screaming and crying. I sat up just long enough to see he was on the phone, I looked next to me and everything came back. What had I done? It took me a few seconds to make out what was left of the face I had beaten the night before. It was Dave, face bruised and bloodied and covered in face paint.

In the following days of the police investigation I found out that Dave had been to a carnival with his girlfriend that night. He had his face painted. In my inebriated state I hadn't recognized him and beat my best friends brother to death. Tomorrow I report to prison to serve 10-20 years for manslaughter. I was given a few days to get my affairs in order, I had missed the funeral due to the trial (not that the family would have wanted me there in the first place). I decided to visit his grave, to ask his forgiveness for my terrible mistake.

The groundskeeper took me to his grave, still covered in freshly dug earth. I remembered the one and only time I was able to meet him, how we spoke about how close he and his brother were. About their nicknames.

I read the  grave marker ""Here lies John David Rollins""

non_PTSD,"I'm going to begin this with a few warnings
A) it may seem that this isn't serious because I have a weird way of dealing with traumatic events (death, horrifying situations) I use humor to make myself feel better.
B) I'm typing this on my iPad so I'm sorry for any typos, I just need to get this story out.

So it's about 3:30am right now, I was just outside for a smoke (I know, it's a gross disgusting habit that will kill me) but after what just happened I may never go out for late might smoke ever again.

So I live (near) Daytona Beach Florida, about 5 minutes outside the city limits. It's currently spring break season and I live in a small development. Over the past few weeks I have seen ""for rent"" signs go up around my neighborhood. I asked one of my roommates what was up and he said people rented their houses out to spring breakers around this time of year because they didn't want to be here and could make some decent cash in just a few weeks (apparently people will rent out a house for around $1000 a week to spring breakers). 

So expecting the expecting, I've seen quite a few drunk frat guys and sorority sluts (no judgement, just me coping in my own way) walking around the neighborhood in the past few nights...one guy was dressed as a gladiator, it was awesome.

So tonight, I go out to have a late night, I can't sleep, cig. I can hear a few parties going on and some techno music bumping (semi annoying, but whatever) and I see this pure black figure walking down the road (not hidden in shadows since we have street lamps) but a pure black figure walking down the middle of the street. It took me a few seconds to figure out what I was looking at, just another frat boy being stupid?

Interjection, typically I will go around to the side of my house to my smoke spot so I don't bug my roommates, but it's late so I decide to just stand right outside the front door and smoke since no one is awake.

Continuing, so I'm watching this pure black figure walk down the street, my back to a solid wall (door) trying to figure out what this person is doing. Out of the corner of my eye I see a hand coming up behind me and I almost have a fucking heart attack. One of my roommates was woken by the partying and decided to step outside to see what was up and to also give me a heart attack. They place their hand on my shoulder and scream because I jumped when they touched me. Seriously I've never heard a 24 year old man scream like my roommate did when he touched me and I jumped. We laugh for a few seconds and I say ""hey, check out this kid wearing all black on the street"". He looks and agrees that it's weird but based off of what we've seen the past few days, it isn't anything too weird.

My roommate goes back inside and I decide to stay out and have another smoke (don't judge me).

So it's taking this dark character a really long time to make his way down this (very short) street. He seems to be just wondering around aimlessly. It has to be a drunk frat guy. I'm just about to finish my smoke and go back inside when I turn around and I'm face to face with someone I've never seen before. My initial instinct is to throw a punch and run for my life but halfway through cocking my arm back I realize that somehow a very drunk kid snuck up behind me and just wanted to ask a question.

""Have you seen my friend?"" He asks me drunkenly and through a very slurred accent. ""Hve youu ummm seen m'friend"" is probably closer to what he said. ""Umm I'm not sure"" I said as I took a few steps back from this guy who was way too close to me (seriously, I could tell all the different types of alcohol he had drank that night from his breath...way too close) ""what does he look like?"" 

He responds with the most vague description ever ""umm he isn't very tall, but he isn't short either... He has shortish hair..."" He keeps describing his friend but after these few vague details I could tell he was too shitfaced to describe his friend. ""Will you help me look for him?"" He asked with that same drunken slur. ""Ummm sure...let's go look""

So after a few minutes of looking for this guys friend I decide this kid is way too drunk to stand, much less look for his friend. I finally get him to tell me what house he's at and I take him back. His friends all thank me and offer me a few a drinks but I declined.

So I'm about a block from my house and I'm walking down the street and standing in the middle of the street is this same dark character. (At this point I'm thinking the same thing as you, this dark character is the drunk guys friend). So I walk up to him since he's just standing there and as I get closer I realize it's someone in one of those elastic body suits (like green man from Its always sunny or some of those internet clips) so I calm down a little. So I walk up to him and say ""hey, your friends are all looking for you, you might want to go back to *insert the house I was just at here* because they're worried about you.

What he said next scared the fuck out of me...I can't describe the level of horror and fear that this sentence put in me. I'm expecting a drunk frat guy to slur some stupid shit at me about how he's okay and knows what he's doing...in the most sober, sincere voice I've ever heard he says ""actually, it's your friends who should be worried about you.""

I fucking froze...I wanted that instinct of punch and run to come back to me. ""What the fuck?"" I asked..but after 10 seconds I realized I had only said it in my head and I had been staring at this blank spandex face for 10 seconds.

Thank god some instinct came back, I didn't throw a punch, but good lord did I run. I wanted to run back to my house and lock the door, but I didn't want to risk him following me to my house. So I just ran. Across people yards, jumped a fence, and finally felt like I had lost him. I took a minute to catch my breath (I'm a smoker, we can't run very long...) and I looked around and didn't see him at all.

I wasn't very far from my house at this point so I started walking towards it. Occasionally turning around walking backwards to check behind me. So far, so good. But I remember that he had seen me smoking outside my house... He fucking knew where I lived...

I made it back to my house without incident, sprinted inside and locked that door so hard I almost broke it. My roommate (the one who scared  me earlier) was still up at the kitchen table and asked me what took me so long. After some discussion I explained the whole incident to him, and after agreeing that it was weird, he said ""that's not what I meant though, I just saw you walking around behind the house (my smoke spot)""

Holy shit he was here...

My roommate called the cops and they arrived fairly quickly (I guess they were shutting down party's). I explained the whole situation to them and they took notes (while exchanging glances that screamed ""this kid is paranoid"").

After a small search the police told me that they found a black body suit lying next to my house (smoke spot) with a note. I asked them to tell me what it said but they said it wasn't important and not to worry. One of the officers left his clipboard on the table long enough for me to sneak a peak at his notes. I read them all lightning fast trying to see what was said about the note that was left with the body suit...

""Your friends should still be worried""

non_PTSD,"Hey guys, whats going on. After a long, hard struggle from being raised in a very Christian family with a father (who got his masters in theology and became a pastor) I have finally embraced science and accepted that there is no god. I want to say a few things though.

1) I love and respect the hell out of my father for going back to get his masters at 45 years old (even if I don't agree with what he got it in, still impressive, so there will be no comments against him)

2) I'm sure you guys get this all the time, but I feel this subreddit should be more about the forward movement of atheism and not so much about the bashing of religion(s)

3) 3rd and finally, (basing this off my second point) I will never hate on someone for believing what they think to be right. I am lucky enough to have found the truth. I understand that alot of religions can be pretty extremist and hateful and hurtful (and trust me, it hurts me to see this happen) but I'm not gonna post stupid quotes and pictures about people doing stupid and hurtful things to others, just to make myself feel better. Obviously I disagree with all of this, and I will never defend extremist behavior. But coming from my background, I'm not gonna shit on people for ""praying"" for others. Sometimes you can't help someone in need...I choose to keep these people in my thoughts.

TL;DR yes I'm an atheist, but I don't hate religious people

I wanted to post an update because there were so many people requesting it yesterday. I went to work this morning with a game plan: Don't be embarrassed by what happened, just go in there and own it. Many if you told me that if I would just be cool about it and make it a joke instead of being ""pissy"", it would be much better for everyone. That plan worked great until I walked in the front door this morning, bold and confident, and the receptionist asked me what happened yesterday, because she heard I peed my pants and passed out. SHIIIIIIIIIT. My confidence was gone, and I told her I had somewhere to be and rushed to my desk, careful not to make eye contact with anyone else.


About 8:30, my boss called me into his office. I put my head down and went in, not sure I did anything that could get me into trouble, but sure he was about to talk about something from yesterday's meeting. He told me to shut the door and have a seat, which I did. He then proceeded to ask me if I was ok, because he heard I had passed out. He never mentioned the pee or my little piggy peeking out the barn doors. He told me others in the meeting had complained about having such a long meeting without breaks and apologized to me. I left his office feeling good again, and I went and talked with a group of coworkers huddled together (likely talking about me). I joked around with them about it and owned it like a man. They didn't have nearly as awesome of nicknames as you all did. The one that stuck seems to be ""TKO"" or ""The Fountain"".


I even went back to the scene of the incident about midday. This picture was pinned to the wall above the urinal: [I thought it was pretty clever](http://m.imgur.com/Jss4egJ).


Thanks to everyone who commented on my first post! I read every message in my inbox and you all had some awesome advice and really helped out! Glad you all could laugh at my epic f***up! It ended up not being as bad as I thought (even though I'll always be the guy at work who pissed like a geyser while laying in the floor unconscious).",Brenvol
non_PTSD,"I had a meeting at work today. There were about 30 people in the meeting, and it was very important. It was only supposed to last 1-2 hours, but it went way over time. 3 hours after the meeting started, I really had to pee. But seeing as it was already an hour over time, I was confident I could hold it till the meeting was over. No one else had gotten up since the meeting started, and seeing as I've only been employed there for less than a month, I wasn't going to be the first one to do so.


 After 4 hours, my bladder was about to explode. I battled myself mentally, trying to convince myself to just go pee, while the other half of me didn't want to make a bad impression this early in my career. Right as I was about to jump up and just go for it, they wrapped up the meeting. As soon as they dismissed, I jumped from my seat and ran straight to the bathroom.


I started unzipping before i had barely made it into the bathroom, and I was already peeing 2 steps from the urinal. I settled in at the urinal and unleashed a fire-hydrant load of urine. Apparently I wasn't the only one who had to use the restroom, because there were more and more people coming in and using the toilets or standing along the wall behind me, waiting for the urinal to open up. 


Not wanting to stand there and pee forever, I tensed up by bladder, peeing as hard and as fast as I could. I guess when you do this you also hold your breath. Either way, I pushed way too hard, for way too long. I started getting really light headed and lost my balance. I took 2 steps back and passed out, falling straight on my back. I was probably only passed out in the floor for less than 5 seconds, but that was plenty enough time for about 10 of my coworkers to see me stumble back, fall in the floor with my dick hanging out of my pants, and then piss into the air like an angel statue in a park all over myself and the floor. I'm not sure I can show my face there tomorrow.


Tl;dr Tried to pee too hard, showed my dick to my coworkers, and pissed all over myself.



Edit- I was feeling better about the situation after reading some of your comments until I realized that someone had to clean up my urine after I left. Omgomgomg



Edit2- Holy shit guys, you popped my gold cherry not once, but twice! Not that it will help me when I have to go to work tomorrow, but it makes me happy for now at least! Thanks!

1)When you look for errors, do you typically examine the front and back of the coin? I typically only check the heads side of the coin, which means I may be missing rotated faces or double die tails sides. Am I making a mistake by only checking the heads side for double die or more obvious errors?

2) Are most errors visible by the naked eye? Or will most errors only be visible under magnification?

3) Do all years of coins have potential errors or is there a certain rule to follow in regards to looking for them?

For those of you who do this regularly, do you roll them before taking them back to the bank? I assume that is the thing to do, or you would makes banks very frustrated.

non_PTSD,"In August of 1984 Manitowoc sheriff Tom Kocourek sent 3 officers to execute a search warrant.

They had obtained the warrant to search the home of Joseph and Brenda Irwin for 3 stolen pressure cookers and 4 ounces of Marijuana.  

The officers barged into the home without knocking wearing camouflage uniforms and carrying guns. 

One officer shot and killed the family's german shepherd. Another officer allegedly struck Brenda Irwin with the butt of his gun.

 In the home at the time were 2 women, several young children, and 1 elderly man. 

The officers found nothing. No drugs. No stolen pressure cookers.

The Irwins moved to another part of Wisconsin and filed the lawsuit against Manitowoc police, eventually being awarded $85k by a jury.

non_PTSD,"Ok, so this actually happened 5 or 6 years ago.  

It was friday night. My college roommate - let's call him Jim - and I were bored. We had just had a couple of girls bail on our plans to hang out. 

Suddenly, our Friday night had changed from ambitious visions of wild orgies with beautiful sorority girls to a boring re-watching of Avatar like the couple of losers that we actually were. 

I didn't want to give in so easy. ""I'm gonna text Kevin and see what they're up to"". 

Kevin and his brother lived in a nearby apartment and often had video game parties going on. Still pretty loser-y... but at least more fun than the 2 of us watching a movie. They had a sweet setup with a huge tv (it was an old projector-style tv, but it was huge) and all the game systems.

He texted back, ""Hey man, not much, we're actually back home visiting our parents"". Damn. Oh well.

I told Jim the news and he suggested we ask if they wouldn't mind us going over to play video games at their place. We knew where they hid a key, and they had some cool new games, so I thought it was a good idea.

I asked Kevin and he quickly replied ""of course"", then followed it up with ""hey, would you guys mind hauling the old tv to the dump this weekend with your truck? It broke so we got a sweet new flatscreen we just hooked up"".  

Suddenly I had what I thought was a brilliant idea. I texted back ""Sure man. Thanks"".

Then I turned to Jim, pretending to be angry. ""What a fucking prick! He said no!""

Jim looked a little confused ""Oh well, lets just...""

""Fuck that. Lets teach that cocky son of a bitch a lesson"". 

I grabbed my baseball bat and walked out the door calling to Jim ""Come on lets go"".

We walked the couple hundreds yards to their apartment and let ourselves is, Jim looking curious the whole time, but surprisingly not asking any questions.

There it was... the brand new flatscreen mounted on the wall, and right next to it... the old projector tv he wanted us to haul out. 

In my best pissed-off voice I continued my act, ""Who does that fucker think he is?"" and I swung the baseball bat into the old tv with all my might. 

Glass shattered everywhere. It was awesome.  I got a couple more good hits in, screaming nonsense about how pissed off I was. Then I threw the bat down on the carpet, and turned with anticipation to see Jim's face.

He was standing there with his mouth agape, staring in wonder at what I had done.

I was just about to bust up laughing and let him in on the joke when he picked up the bat and screamed out ""Yeah! Fuck Kevin. I fucking hate Kevin!!! Fuck you Kevin!!"" 

Then he took the bat and turned towards the brand new flat screen.

""Wha... Nooooooooo"", I called out, as if in slow motion.

 I watched in mortified shock as he smashed into it hard, screaming ""Fuck you Kevin!"" 

""Jim, STOP! what the fuck?"", I yelled. 

He stopped and turned to me, looking even more confused than before... but it was too late. The damage was done. 

Turns out, Jim had some sort of secret pent-up vendetta against Kevin for supposedly stealing his girl the year before. 

Jim and I spent the weekend cleaning up glass, hauling the tvs to the dump, and maxing out our credit cards. 


TL;DR : Friend wanted me to trash his old tv for him. Tried to get reaction out of another friend by pretending to be pissed off at first friend. Smashed old tv with a bat. Second friend decided to join in and smashed up nice, new tv.

non_PTSD,"Last night, my wife's boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner. On the drive over, my wife reiterated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression. 

I scoffed and arrogantly informed my silly wife that I always make good impressions. 

My wife's boss is a single lady in her fifties, so it was just the three of us. We chitchatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. She laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased.

Soon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. As I began to cut into my steak, I was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was.

Now,  I've had my fair share of rare steak. I prefer medium, but I can handle rare. This was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. I probably could've resuscitated the cow had I tried. Instead, I sat there fidgeting with my knife and fork, worrying about how I was going to get away with not eating this steak. 

Claim vegan-ism? No, I'd already feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak.

Just then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. As I looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head.

I knew I had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. I committed. I grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window.

Here's the big time FU.  The window wasn't open.  It was the cleanest fricking window you've ever seen in your life. That is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake.

My wife - who's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like I was an alien from another planet. This look then slowly morphed into more of a there-is-no-place-on-this-planet-you-can-ever-hide-from-me expression of demonic anger. 

My wife's boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. She took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look.

I just didn't know what to say. It felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. Finally, the best I could manage was ""I... I'm so sorry. I am such a clutz... I don't know... I was just cutting it.. and... it...  ... it slipped... just ask my wife, I really am a clutz... right honey?... (no help coming from that direction) ... I will clean this up... I can't believe this... I am so sorry"" etc... etc...

Both women continued to stare at me like I had escaped from the loony bin, as I smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin, dusted off the steak, and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation. I knew no one was buying the story.

I knew what I had to do. I sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak. 

I remained pretty quiet the rest of the evening. My wife's only two words to me since the incident are ""I'm fine"". 

TL;DR:  Tried to sneakily throw my under-cooked steak through an open window... only to find out it wasn't open.

Edit: Wow, thanks stranger!!

Update: Just got the first post-""I'm fine"" communication from my wife, via text, who is at work...

I waited in the lobby for about 3 hours till they called me in, and I was sure I had my lines down and was ready to kill the part, but WOW. I'm not a shy person but my nerves took over in this instance. I barely acted out my lines. I felt like all I could do is lifelessly read them. The guys were cool and had me redo them a few times and I could tell I loosened up with each re-read but still I was nowhere near the level I do at home.

When I get to the ER, the first thing on my mind was to ask whether or not they accept my insurance. I told her the insurance I had and she said they accepted it. If she had said no I would have walked right out.

Fast forward to being seen - the doctor looks in my ear and tells me I need to see an ENT (ear, nose, throat doctor) and that he can't touch my ear. He says he'll give me an antibacterial and an antifungal, and not to put any more drops of any kind in my ear.

Fast forward to filling out my prescription - I realize he not only didn't prescribe me antibacterial or antifungal, but he DID prescribe me ear drops.. which he had said in the room not to use at all.

So fast forward to today, and I realize that my insurance will not pay for the visit at all, and that they ""have to say they take all insurances"" as part of ER law, which I understand now, but the way that woman said it and asked what insurance I had etc. was very sneaky. I'm positive she knew what I meant and she knew my insurance wouldn't pay it (found out this ER was a direct competitor of my insurance company hospital). 

So my questions are: Why in the world are they allowed to say they take my insurance when they don't, and now I'm left with $1000 bill for getting absolutely nothing done? Even if I can't fight the case with her semantics (which I guess my ignorance comes into play), what about how the doctor not only didn't do anything besides tell me to go to an ENT, but gave me the wrong prescription? This whole thing is just messed up and I can't believe I'm about to drop an entire thousand fucking dollars on literally having someone tell me he can't do anything. Is there anything I can do?

My girlfriend (who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time) said I am ""invited to dinner"" with her and her parents. I was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. But I knew it must be done. 

I met them nicely, I should tell you, and it started off in a good way. The idea slapped my mind that I should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing. 

When I saw that baked potatoes were served I got the idea that it would be very good if I pretended I did not know what potatoes was. That would be funny.

Well let me tell you: backfired on my face. I'll tell you how. 

So first when the potato became on my plate, I acted very interesting. I showed an expression on my face so as to seem that I was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. They did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. So I asked ""This looks very interesting. What is this?"" 

They stared at me and the mother said ""It's a baked potato.""  And I was saying ""Oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?"" 

And she was like ""A potato."" 

And I was like ""A 'potato', oh interesting. Never heard of a potato, looks pretty good."" 

And then they didn't see I was clowning, but thought I really did not know what is a potato. So I knew I would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if I admitted to making a bad joke, so what I did was to act as if it was not a joke but I committed to the act of pretending I didn't know what a potato is. 

They asked me, VERY incredulous, did I really not know what a potato is? That I never heard of a potato. I went with it and told them, yes, I did not ever even hear of a potato. Not only had I never eaten a potato I had never heard the word potato. 

This went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my ""fucked up antics"", and then the more insistent I was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking I DID know what a potato was.

Well let me tell you I had to commit 100% at this point. When I would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. At one point he said something like ""Enough is enough. You're fucking with us. Admit it.""  And I said ""Sir, before today I never heard of a potato. I still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. I don't know what to tell you."" 

Well let me tell you he got very annoyed. I decided to take a bite of the potato, and when I did I made a high pitched noise and said ""Taste's very strange!"" 

That is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying ""What are you doing?"" and my girlfriend went to some other room. 

Finally the father said I should ""Get the fuck out of his house"" and I said it was irrational to treat me like this just because I never heard of a potato before. Well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. 

Now in text messages I have been telling my girlfriend I really don't know what a potato is. The only way I can ever get out of this is for them to buy that I don't know what a potato is. 

I wish I never started it but I can't go back. I think she will break up with me anyway. ",NotKnowPotato

Hi, I my name's John. I've been lurking for a while, but I've finally made an account to post this. I need to get my life off my chest.  About me. I'm a 46 year old banker and I have been living my whole life the opposite of how I wanted. All my dreams, my passion, gone. In a steady 9-7 job. 6 days a week. For 26 years. I repeatedly chose the safe path for everything, which eventually changed who I was.

Today I found out my wife has been cheating on me for the last 10 years. My son feels nothing for me. I realised I missed my father's funeral FOR NOTHING. I didn't complete my novel, travelling the world, helping the homeless. All these things I thought I knew to be a certainty about myself when i was in my late teens and early twenties. If my younger self had met me today, I would have punched myself in the face. I'll get to how those dreams were crushed soon.

Let's start with a description of me when I was 20. It seemed only yesterday when I was sure I was going to change the world. People loved me, and I loved people. I was innovative, creative, spontaneous, risk-taking and great with people. I had two dreams. The first, was writing a utopic/dystopic book. The second, was travelling the world and helping the poor and homeless.
I had been dating my wife for four years by then. Young love. She loved my spontaneity, my energy, my ability to make people laugh and feel loved. I knew my book was going to change the world. I would show the perspective of the 'bad' and the 'twisted', showing my viewers that everybody thinks differently, that people never think what the do is wrong. I was 70 pages through when i was 20. I am still 70 pages in, at 46. By 20, I had backpacking around New Zealand and the Phillipines. I planned to do all of Asia, then Europe, then America (I live in Australia by the way). To date, I have only been to New Zealand and the Phillipines.

Now, we get to where it all went wrong. My biggest regrets. I was 20. I was the only child. I needed to be stable. I needed to take that graduate job, which would dictate my whole life. To devote my entire life in a 9-7 job. What was I thinking? How could I live, when the job was my life? After coming home, I would eat dinner, prepare my work for the following day, and sleep at 10pm, to wake up at 6am the following day. God, I can't remember the last time I've made love to my wife.

Yesterday, my wife admitted to cheating on me for the last 10 years. 10 years. That seems like a long time, but i can't comprehend it. It doesn't even hurt. She says it's because I've changed. I'm not the person I was. What have I been doing in the last 10 years? Outside of work, I really can't say anything. Not being a proper husband. Not being ME. Who am I? What happened to me? I didn't even ask for a divorce, or yell at her, or cry. I felt NOTHING. Now I can feel a tear as I write this. But not because my wife has been cheating on me, but because I am now realising I have been dying inside. What happened to that fun-loving, risk-taking, energetic person that was me, hungering to change the world? I remember being asked on a date by the most popular girl in the school, but declining her for my now-wife. God, I was really popular with the girls in high school. In university/college too. But i stayed loyal. I didn't explore. I studied everyday. 

Remember all that backpacking and book-writing I told you about? That was all in the first few years of college. I worked part-time and splurged all that I had earned. Now, I save every penny. I don't remember a time I spend anything on anything fun. On anything for myself. What do I even want now?

My father passed ten years ago. I remember getting calls from mom, telling me he was getting sicker and sicker. I was getting busier and busier, on the verge of a big promotion. I kept putting my visit off, hoping in my mind he would hold on. He died, and I got my promotion. I haven't seen him in 15 years. When he died, I told myself it didn't matter what I didn't see him. Being an atheist, I rationalized that being dead, it wouldn't matter anyway. WHAT WAS I THINKING? Rationalizing everything, making excuses to put things off. Excuses. Procrastination. It all leads to one thing, nothing. I rationalized that financial security was the most important thing. I now know, that it definitely is not.
I regret doing nothing with my energy, when I had it. My passions. My youth. I regret letting my job take over my life. I regret being an awful husband, a money-making machine. I regret not finishing my novel, not travelling the world. Not being emotionally there for my son. Being a damn emotionless wallet.

If you're reading this, and you have a whole life ahead of you, please. Don't procrastinate. Don't leave your dreams for later. Relish in your energy, your passions. Don't stay on the internet with all your spare time (unless your passion needs it). Please, do something with your life while your young. DO NOT settle down at 20. DO NOT forget your friends, your family. Yourself. Do NOT waste your life. Your ambitions. Like I did mine. Do not be like me.

Sorry for the long post, just had to get it out there.

TL:DR I realised I let procrastination and money stop me from pursuing my passions when I was younger, and now I am dead inside, old and tired.





Edit: I am quite overwhelmed at the response, thank you for your time. I had posted on a whim, and did not expect the reception.

In regards to my post, I must admit I was quite emotional at the time. As I read what I had written earlier, I can't stop myself from noticing an abundance of spelling and grammatical mistakes, phrases that I would not usually say. I don't think I have used Capital Locks so much in my life. 
However I will not edit them. That would not do it justice.

I have read many of the replies and will try my best to answer the reoccurring questions. I will add that the replies have given me a new perspective of life, Reddit and humanity in general. The amount of encouragement and humour persists to amaze me. Despite my situation, I even found myself laughing at a few of the comments.

What my plans are.
I am planning to cut down my hours substantially. I will take a new job if I have to, as I am relatively well-off. I am going to talk to my wife. Divorce is currently not what I have in mind and I hope that our communication and relationship will improve. If it doesn't, then so be it. We will both move on. I see there are quite a number of negative comments about her, however I am going to have to say in her defence, she really is a lovely person. She is smart, empathetic and has a great sense of humour. I'm not saying it was okay for her to do what she did, but she's not an evil person. I know that. We were both in the fault. We let communication dwindle, and with it, our relationship. There is so much more to being a head of house than just being able to bring in the money. A steady balance of emotional connection, love and finance is what I will strive to give.

My son. I don't any anything about him. I really don't. I have unknowingly distanced myself from him; I only see him around dinner time. I do not recall having a proper conversation with him, it's quite preposterous now that I think about it. I'm not exactly sure how I'll start bonding with him, I have become quite a boring person. However, I plan to change that. I refuse to be a poor role model. I will ensure that he does not make the same mistake I did with my family. I have decided I am going to start watching his basketball games and rugby games on Saturdays. I never have, due to work, but I will ensure that I do. Perhaps I will even play video games with him. There was a time I had a collection of SNES games, and I wasn't half bad either. Who knows, I might really connect with my son, and it seems to be something he enjoys.

In regards to the novel and travelling, I admit, I am a different person from my youth. I no longer have the creativity and desire to complete the novel. When I found the long-forgotten 70 pages, the writing was no longer mine. I have changed substantially in 26 years. I am sorry to disappoint as so many of you seemed incredibly keen to read it. However, I am just as excited to read the stories of all of you aspiring writers that have expressed their passion!
The travelling, I might still do. Family trips probably, in the school holidays. Maybe with my wife every now and then, if she'd have me. 

I can't turn back time and see my father for a final time, though my mother is still alive. She lives in London, so visits are quite difficult. However, I will make an effort to see her. I do love my parents. I only wish I had not prioritised them as I did.

In regards to the advice I have given. I stand by what I said. Live your life. Do not procrastinate and let lethargy stop you. However, I might add, avoid living in poverty. I have had the good fortune to have had never experienced hunger or homelessness. I would imagine chasing your ambitions and being happy would be considerable more difficult without proper nutrition and living standards! I believe someone mentioned their dream was financial stability. I say, that is just as valiant as any dream to have. We are all different and are missing different things in our lives, be honest with yourself and you'll know what you really want.
I believe there were arguments upon my language and university/college or what not. I will clarify that, although Australians generally call tertiary education 'university' here, I have made small efforts to pertain to Americans, as they are the main users, at least I assume. And yes, university/college was free when I attended. I believe Australians now are able to attend them relatively free (upfront) and can pay their fees after they graduate.

I believe I have covered the general scope of questions. 

P.S. Thank you for the gold, I do appreciate it, but they aren't of real value to me. Perhaps if Reddit ever includes a re-gifting gold feature, I will gift them to some of the commenters. And yes, please stop sending me gold! I also believe someone tried to even donate to me? I assure you, money is not what I read. Please save it for yourself!

I don't think I'll come back to Reddit, unless i hear about a way to re-gift gold. I thank you all for your sympathy, your time, and I wish all the best for those in difficult situations. I have faith in your capacity and ability to change, to become happy, to help yourselves. Because after all, you're the person in the best position to.
And no, I am not considering religion, I just do not have the correct mindset. I am logical to the point that I cannot, however that is not to say religion isn't bad, it gives people the hope and sense after death which I really do envy.

Sincerest of Regards,

John.

#[Reddit's CEO Ellen Pao under SEC/FBI investigation for her part in her husband's ponzi scheme - READ THESE COURT DOCS](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/256174979-Kleiner-Perkins-brief.pdf)

[ONE WEIRD AND FUNNY COURT DOC TRICK EXPOSED (READ!)](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/256174979-Kleiner-Perkins-brief.pdf).

**Orig. comment moved below.**

The current (before she is in prison) reddit joke CEO is Ellen Pao, as of a few weeks ago when Yishan Wong, (who personally hired her and put her forward for the CEO position, and has totally not had sex with her either, honest, he's married, she wouldn't do that) stepped down instantly without warning... and she was instated within the week. Unheard of.

Ellen Pao, a psychotic and entitled monster **who is being investigated by the SEC and FBI along with her hubby for their role in a ponzi scheme ripping people off**. Ellen Pao is fraudulently suing their previous employer to get some go-money as she is:

 * Bankrupt
 * Illiquid
 * In massive debt
 * Any other synonyms for fucked?

But, guess what? **Order now and we'll throw in a pre-trial injunction that forbids the discussion of Ellen Pao's financial situation**. Right. Because the fact that she has negative net worth and zero liquidity despite her charity position at reddit has no bearing on a $16M-$144M hail mary. (those gilds on this comment are literally paying for her lawyers' coffees... I le sigh).

While doing so she is taking every chance to shit on every woman who has truly suffered discrimination at their job.

Ellen Pao is trying to characterize a relationship she had while at the company as ""almost"" rape, saying she ""succumbed to advances""... and ""while it wasn't rape, it was consensual... not rape... did I say rape enough yet?"": 

 * She invited the guy out for dinner
 * she said he was her hero and his mind was amazing
 * she bought him chocolates
 * she admitted she loved him
   * wanted to marry him
   * wanted to have kids with him
 * FYI: She never said this was rape, in fact she has MANY MANY TIMES, said ""it was not rape"". You know. Like a suspicious number of times. Which is weird. She usually says it like ""it was entirely consensual dot dot dot"", or ""it wasn't rape at all dot dot dot"". Like, I don't know, there's something sinister and almost rapey about her having sex with someone if he didn't leave his wife for her afterwards. Or she just wants the words ""^not rape"" and ""^wasn't non-consensual"" on the jury's mind.

But, wait for it. They had sex... and you know what that means in her mind. Entitlement.

So it turns out **HE DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIS WIFE FOR HER**. Ellen Pao seduced (sorry, succumbed to the advances of, and clearly someone who cannot make their own sober decisions about which dick to suck, needs to be a CEO. I know many (many) women who are capable of saying no to sucking dick (someone hold me...)) and screwed a married guy at work, then got antsy when he didn't leave his wife.

Wait... but that can't be true, I just said she didn't have sex with Yishan Wong, because he's married and... wait. Just to be clear \*moves mic closer\* Yishan Wong did not have sexual relations with Ellen Pao. Allegedly. I mean.

#The current Reddit CEO Ellen Pao totally did not have sex with the last Reddit CEO Yishan Wong, just making that clear in case anyone else reads between the lines and gets the wrong idea, ALSO Ellen Pao DID NOT RAPE Yishan Wong. I know I probably shouldn't even bring it up, but I just want to be clear on that.

She didn't rape him, but you see the effect first hand now. Seriously though guys, this rumor should not get out of hand. It's probably salubrious and prophylactic just to casually mention that Ellen Pao did not rape Yishan Wong to get the CEO position. I mean, let's nip this rumor in the bud, before it spreads. Let's get ahead of it.

**Edit**: I've heard rumors that huffingtonpost is going to run the rape allegation story, that seems a bit unfair, we really shouldn't let this get out of hand.

She also did not promise him a cut of her ""winnings"" of $16,000,000 - $144,000,000 if he stepped down his reddit position (poorly paid one at that) and vie for ten years salary payment from her instead, by making her a ""CEO"", although a joke title here at le reddits, it looks good for her case.

oooooh snap! \*Maury-I am not the father dance\*

**So when he decided not to leave his wife for her after a brief fling**, she is on record showing she spent FIVE YEARS deliberately trying to stir shit up, how much shit? Literally 200,000 pieces of paper. She's trying to win the old hail-mary sue my company by a sheer volume of attack, combined with five years of only keeping emails and parts of reply chains that gave a context to her being ""shunned"". She goads people and tries her damnedest to cause conflict to get it on record. AND FAILS!

So she thinks that she has 200,000 throws of the dice to win this case. It doesn't work that way.

1. She was paid MORE than her male colleagues
1. Given the best mentorship, guidance and coaching from the most reknown and _expensive_ coaches
1. She had hundreds of complaints filed against her from WOMEN in the organization, that she MASSIVELY discriminated against **filing poor reviews and criticisms and complaints against almost all women she worked with**.
1. She has emails showing her taking advice from lawyers back in 2008, then one _friend_ of hers saying ""delete all emails except those you can use to try and sway your case"". So she did that. For five years.
1. Her complains amount to: I was made to sit at the back and take notes. Despite only doing that on ONE occasion and actually spending the first days in the front row, people not letting me in to their deals... after people complaining she was always trying to get into deals after the research and diligence was done, instead of coming up with her own ideas. That's it, literally it.
1. She was offered her dream job, the job she wrote she wanted, when she was found to have failed _EVERY SINGLE_ employee assessment for five years running, and missing _EVERY TARGET_. She refused, knowing it would hurt her CASE she had been building if she accepted.
1. She starts suing them while working there, being extremely abrasive, basically like Westboro Baptist abrasive, while trying to goad someone to make a move that would help her case. Nobody did.
1. As SOON as she complained they hired an investigator for her, literally within a minute, to help her. She refused to speak to the investigator they hired to HELP HER, while she was preparing her case, and finally did ONLY WITH HER OWN LAWYER PRESENT lol.

So she wanted to paint a picture of her being oppressed. What a sad fuck. Pissing in the face of every hard working person and shitting on the progress so many amazingly talented women have made. **That's right Ellen Pao, shit into the mouths of all those professional women who would never stoop to such dirty fraud to get ahead.** 

#\#2girls1CEO

Ellen Pao wants someone to gild her $16,000,000 to $144,000,000 because she fucked a married guy, they talked about him leaving his wife and marrying her and having kids, he didn't... somehow that entitles her to $16,000,000 to $144,000,000 , and it's totally not a hail-mary because she's going to prison. When the SEC / FBI get through untangling the ponzi scheme in the Caymans.

Does this offend any of you? (The disrespect) 

If it was disrespected isn't it covered by the 1st amendment?

It would seem that anyone who defends the flag is labeled as a psychopath and that they are out of control. The general consensus on other subbreddits and media outlets is that these events of disrespecting the flag are protected by the 1st amendment. 

I've taken the usual rhetoric to this which is; ""Don't disrespect the nation that gave you those rights"" and elaborated due to a recent posting. (I can't believe the blind hate and off subject arguments that can generate on other subs about this) 

I've said:
>  If the nation didn't exist it wouldn't have presented the opportunity for these inalienable rights to have been recognized. Thus without the nation the inalienable rights are alienable in application.

non_PTSD,"Convert at 18. Served Full time mission. Married in SLC temple. 25 Provo. (most of you are rubbing your hands in anticipation) 

Now for something a little off. Autistic. PTSD. Cannabis user. Biology Student. A bit inactive now, but i fully believe in the doctrine. I came from child abuse and my father died of a heroin overdose. 

Hopefully with that context in mind, my questions can be seen in the light in which i mean them. Please consider a bit more background.

My Conversion to the Church was a powerful experience and its not one that i could ever retract or deny. I fully profess the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught in latter day scripture and support Joseph Smith as a prophet of the restoration. I believe in the intelligences that imbue matter in meta physical laws and fashions, i believe in the progression through eternity and the graduation and capacitation of these intelligences. I understand and believe in the father, son and holy ghost and the Three greater kingdoms of glory as outlined. I believe that the Father has achieved the highest state of consciousness that an intelligence can achieve and that the Father is a result of laws that can not be broken and have him remain God. I believe that what the Church professes and directs is to be a straight and narrow path that will lead any follower to the celestial kingdom of glory. I understand the gospel. It is pure and it is true and i love it. The Gospel of progression and love. 

But.

I know that we don't have to be like Father if we don't want to. I know there are other kingdoms and options to take in existence. Maybe we can be reincarnated, maybe we can float in space for a few thousand years, maybe we can become apart of the very encompassing power that creates the physical spiritual laws by which the Gods themselves live by. Not controlled by, but in harmony with. I look at the religions in the world and their dreams and aspirations and paths and i see them all as plausible. Some of them i see as synonymous theology with what i believe in. That annihilation is not true. In short, i believe that i can become like father and that it would be good. But i know that its not for everyone and that happiness and love are the habitation of his throne. I think we are all too hard on ourselves and that people can explore what routes they will in the universe with love in their hearts. 

With that finally said (sorry). 

There is a lot i don't like about the ***church itself***. Most of it is because of the Utah Culture verses actual doctrine. A distinction that must be made. I do not like the culture and the teachings that leak into my block meetings. Its false and its wrong. I do not like the personalities and actions of most of the cultures members. (Keeping in mind most of my interactions are 18-22 Single Wards). There are historic accounts and recent accounts by the church that i do not agree with. ( I fully support gay rights, but i also know that polygamy was the right thing to do at the time). 

So for those of you who left the church, do you still believe in: a)Progression in the Universe? Or b)Annihilation? 

a1)Do you deny the church but still believe in the Doctrine?

a2)Has the Church in your opinion become Apostate? If so explain. 

b1) I understand. But i feel that we have enough physical and astronomical evidence to indicate/support that existence persists after death. I respect your view.

non_PTSD,"I smoked for several years and successfully quit. I drank for years and successfully quit. I smoked cannabis for years and successfully quit. I've tried several kinds of recreational drugs and i can honestly say i've never been addicted. I understand the biological dispositions some have to chemical addiction however, i do wonder what affect will power has on the matter. My father died from a heroin overdose and most of my family are addicts or dead so i know i likely have a genetic disposition to addiction. I experience the ""withdrawals"" but its not that big of a deal, fighting overstimulation and forcing myself to interact with NT's i believe has strengthened my will power. 

Does anyone else have a similar pattern?

Note: I have recently started smoking cannabis again(after 7 years) in small dosages to help with anxiety from academia. It helps. I don't get high as i treat it like a medicine and i don't abuse that. Since i am constantly hyper focused on everything around me it helps mellow me out, i have noticed however that i still focus on everything but that it is just easier to handle.  My ability to quickly memorize information is impeded while under the influence of a dosage that is too high. But overall, its a good way for me to release tension i feel as long as i don't need to quickly master a new subject. 

Admittedly due to the nature of cannabis and its respective chemicals, finding a good dosage is tricky at first. Under careful observation i feel that small frequent doses are the best once an initial loading dose has been configured. I uptake around 0.03-0.04 Grams daily of a highly quality specimen. I do also skip days depending on logistical factors. The Loading dose required two attempts at 0.1 Grams to properly configure a concentration level suitable for my needs. 


Any other aspies who smoke weed?

non_PTSD,"So my coworker (call him Jeff) is asexual, but his parents kept trying to get him a girlfriend. When he kept rejecting them, his parents eventually asked if he was gay. He decided to pretend he was and said he was already seeing a coworker and then asked me to pretend to be with him, even going so far as to offer money (I don't really know enough people to care about my reputation and could think of worse ways to earn money, so I agreed). His parents wanted to meet me. The original plan was to meet his family and leave a very bad first impression so he would have reason to not bring me around them. Well I got there and it turns out his family is about the most fucking awesome family I've ever met. I expected everybody to either tiptoe around the gay thing, or be very over zealous about supporting it, either way I would overreact and make an ass out of myself. Turns out they treated me just like they would anybody else, so I couldn't do that. Then his twin sister (call her Jenny) comes out and decides to try to make me uncomfortable by sitting on my lap, (I didn't mind) and asking questions that most would consider inappropriate, I kind of fell in love with her that night. Well I ended up leaving a good impression, and was invited to dinner the next night to meet his other sister and her husband. That dinner went great as well, so I ended up just saying ""fuck it, I'll come over whenever they invite me and just hope we don't slip up"". Things went pretty well over next few months, I got along with everybody and kept telling myself I'd ask Jenny out after we told them the truth. Well Jeff ended up getting an apartment and moving out of his parents house, he needed a roommate and I volunteered (I wanted to move out of my parent's house anyway). One night I get back from work to find a fucking candle lit dinner waiting for me, turns out he really was gay and had a crush on me, and decided the best way to seduce me would be an elaborate scheme to trick me into moving in with him. Needless to say I rejected him, and he was actually surprised when I did. So he calls his mom crying and said I cheated on him. His family hates me now, especially Jenny. They won't believe a word out of my mouth, because it's his word against mine. So now I live(signed a 1 year lease) and work with a guy who thinks he's in love with me. I did learn a valuable lesson though; if you are going to live a lie, record some kind of proof that it's a lie.

Tldr; Pretended to be gay to help friend get parents off his back, find out he wasn't pretending. Now I live with a gay guy who thinks he's in love with me.

Update (07/21); Convinced Jenny to let me explain the situation from my point of view. She believes me but said she won't side against her twin even if he's in the wrong. Now my only hope is to convince him to tell the truth. 

Update 2 (07/21); Just went through more drama in an hour than I have in the last 5 years. Basically after Jenny left she went home and confronted Jeff (he slept at their house). They then invited me to come clear the air. I told them the same thing I told Jenny, then Jeff told his side of the story but spun it just enough to convince them that he didn't think we were pretending, and that I led him on. He also left in the part about me cheating, he said he caught me with a girl and that's what sparked this whole mess. Since I can't disprove anything he said, they now believe that I'm a sack of shit that likes to lead on gay men for fun while I'm out sleeping around (I've only been with one girl). And to salt the wound just a little bit more; Jenny called me a creep for letting her sit on my lap, apparently it was only cute when I was gay. The only person who even questioned Jeff's lying ass is his older sister, and she said the same thing Jenny did, ""I won't side against my family, even if they are wrong"". So I just lost what was basically my second family, and I'm either stuck living with captain dipshit or stuck with an apartment I can't afford alone.

Update 3 (07/21); So things just went from a bad situation to a disastrous one. My boss just called me on my day off to tell me Jeff asked to be put on a different schedule than me. Apparently Jeff told him I threatened to kick the shit out of him, and I fucked up more royally than I've ever fucked up before, I said ""I never said anything like that and to tell Jeff to prove it"" and now I've got to go in later to discuss this situation and he told me I was probably going to be suspended until further notice. That motherfucker attacked my job, this means war.

Update 4 (07/21); Well I called my landlord and am meeting him on his lunch break today, also somebody I know offered to get me some legal counsel so I've got a meeting later today to discuss my options. Also is there a better way to do this update thing? I'm not sure if this is correct form for this kind of thing.

Update 5 (07/21); I just got a call from the coworker that knew a bit about it, he got together a group of our coworkers and they pulled Jeff aside and ""convinced"" him to admit he was lying to the manager, so the job part might be resolved. Now we just need to come to an understanding about the apartment. I'm willing to live with him for the remainder of the lease if he's willing to sign a waiver or something stating that this is over. I'm not going to try to fix things with his family, you guys have rightfully pointed out that it isn't worth it. I'll probably end up being a hermit after this mess.

Update 6 (07/21); Just got a confirmation that he came clean to our manager, he's being sent home early and we both have to come back later tonight to resolve this situation, he didn't give me any information about the pending suspension but I'm optimistic. When he gets here I'm going to sit down with him and apologize for everything I've done to hurt him (real or imagined) and then hopefully we can settle this like civilized people. Then after I find someone to take over the lease I'm going to go on my merry way and hope for the best.

Update 6.5; u/Cyae1 narrated this for some reason and it's funny as hell! here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDqGkA72DHw&list=PLl0DkyQa9Aqu_aWjvjzvySIZC8PHUPPO6&index=18

Update 7 (07/21); So Jeff came home and we had a fairly short but very concise discussion. He agreed to put this whole thing behind him on the condition that I let him continue the lie with his family. I agreed to apologize to his family  from the bottom of my heart for cheating on him and admit that I was leading him on. In return he agreed to make a formal confession video admitting that we were both at fault (omitting the cheating and leading on altogether) and he would let it die here and now. We sealed the deal by punching each other and unknown to him, I recorded the whole conversation on my laptop. I won't do anything with said recording unless he forces my hand.

Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart, your comments have helped me think through this mess and not react in a physical manner. This is mostly likely my last update, unless something drastic happens with the landlord, lawyer or workplace. Also he said he'd try to make Jenny apologize for calling me a creep, even he agrees she can't get mad about something she initiated in the first place. And the movie rights go to whoever gets a script written up first, just as long as the actor portraying me is a handsome motherfucker.

Update 7.5; Holy shit this hit the front page, and some kind soul gave me gold! Thank you whoever you are!

Update 8 (07/22); I'm sorry for updating so late, but I fell asleep after getting home and just woke up. I talked to our landlord and told him we had a falling out and even though it's solved I wanted to know if it was possible to get out of the lease, if I could find somebody else willing to take it on. He said he'd be willing to let me draw up a sublet lease (or something along those lines, my memory is fuzzy right now) so if I can find somebody willing to live with dipshit I'll be free. After that I talked to the lawyer, he said that it's illegal to record somebody without consent so if I tried to use the recording I could face criminal charges, he advised I erase the recording. Furthermore he said I could file a lawsuit for slander and something about character, but I'd be open to a countersuit and Jeff has at least 5 people who would be willing to testify on his behalf. Then he told me a restraining order would be a terrible idea, it would be extremely obvious that I was only filing it either as retaliation or as a preemptive legal defense. So he advised me to avoid antagonizing Jeff in any way and hope he doesn't find out about the recording. After that I went to tell my own family what was happening and things didn't go well, my mother first said I was pretending to be gay the same way that guys say they were joking after being rejected. Then after I played the recording she admitted she'd rather have a gay son who's in denial than a son who would manipulate an entire family. So needless to say we aren't speaking at the moment, my siblings are refusing to take sides for the most part, so no help there either. After that me and Jeff met up at work for the meeting with our boss. We both got written up for unprofessional conduct and told this was first and only warning, next time there is drama between us we both get fired. And he's going to put Jeff on a later shift than me so we don't have very much overlap in schedule. Next we went to his family's house so I could make my apology, I decided to follow the advice of the people on here and didn't support his lie about leading him on or cheating, but I didn't directly deny them either so I kept up my part of the deal. After my apology (I even managed a few tears, it wasn't exactly hard) they basically took turns berating me but I took it and didn't argue or defend myself, after that I told them they'd probably never see or hear from me again and left. On my way out the sister's husband followed me out and loudly threatened to fuck me up if he ever saw me again. But he sent me a text like 5 minutes apologizing and said he was just trying to earn some points with them by defending their honor, and that he actually (secretly) was on my side. I basically just rolled my eyes and told him to fuck off. I think that's pretty much it, I'm still shaking like a motherfucker but at least the worst part is over.

Update 9 (07/24); Well I got fired today, our boss was watching through the security footage from the other day and saw the coworkers approach Jeff in ""a menacing manor"" and he decided Jeff only dropped his complaint against me because they threatened him. He also suspended two of the guys involved and fired another. So I'm seriously considering just skipping town right about now.

Final update (07/27); It's been a couple days since my last update, and I don't know how many people will even see this but I'll do it anyway. I've decided to leave town, it's next to impossible to get a job here without connections, and I don't have many, and to make it worse, I was fired from my previous job. Not to mention I either hate or am hated by just about everybody here, and I could use some distance from my family. So I don't see much future in California for me. I'm going to tell my landlord the full story and show him the recording in hopes that he'll let me out of the lease. Even if he doesn't I'm willing to risk taking a ding to my credit (and Jeff's) and just leave anyway. An Xbox friend of mine lives in Texas and told me he'd help me get started if I choose to move to his town, but I'm not eager to blindly trust somebody I barely know (that's what started this shit in the first place). So do you guys have any good advice for me? I'm leaning toward Texas because it would be nice to have somebody to help me get started, but if you guys have a better place please share. A place with fairly low cost of living and plenty of job opportunities would be nice. Anywhere except Colorado or Minnesota.

Some people have asked for another update so here it is (08/05?): I have decided on Texas, my xbox friend has been helping me apply for jobs and look at apartments. I am still living with Jeff and we haven't had any more drama. We both basically pretend that the other one doesn't exist. Jenny actually sent me a text and apologized for her part in this, and I told her to go fuck herself. I've sort of made peace with my mother, but it' an uneasy kind of peace. And my old coworker that got fired for threatening Jeff helped me get an unofficial job moving furniture. They call me when they need help with a delivery or something, and pay me cash.  I considered showing the recording to my old boss to try to get my old job back but decided that I really don't want to work for somebody that jumps to conclusions based on circumstantial evidence regardless of the actual story. If I missed anything let me know and I'll elaborate.

Another quick update for you guys (08/12): I applied at a temp agency last week and they got me a part time job working nights. Tonight is my first night. I also got a job interview next week for a full time day job. If I get it I plan to work both and save up as rapidly as I can. After a month or two I'd be able to move to Texas with enough to have a safety net while I get set up there. Nothing new on the Jeff situation. I usually retreat to my room when he gets home and only come out for food. 

Yet another update (08/14): Things went well at the part time job and they will be keeping me on (they don't know I'm leaving). I went to make peace with my mom and basically told her we needed to agree to disagree before I left, because I probably won't be visiting for a very long time. After a while she actually told me she was considering packing up the family and coming to Texas with me. Nothing is concrete yet but it sounds like she was serious. So I might actually have my family to help me.

Another Update (08/17): Either next week or three weeks from now I'll be going to Texas to work out a place to live. After that I'll come back here, grab a U-Haul and start the process. My family is coming with me, so it will be a bit more complicated but I'm glad to have them. I'll be passing through Bakersfield (CA), Tuscon (AZ), Waco, Dallas, and Austin (TX). I'm still leaning toward Dallas but am open to any of those. If anybody has anything to say about those areas I'd appreciate it. 

Also, I have a football card collection that I'm going to sell if it's worth enough to make a difference. And my mother has a collection of foreign money/coins that she's willing to sell. Does anybody here have any advice on how to go about selling either of them?

Update to answer some common questions/accusations:

""OP is overreacting by moving to a new town just because of some drama""

 I'm not leaving town because of Jeff, I've wanted to leave California for a while now. Being fired just lit a fire under my ass. I wasn't going to seriously consider moving as long as I had a decent job. 

""OP should fuck/beat up Jeff""

I'm not going to take any sort of revenge, I don't want to invite any more problems into my life right now. I've been talking to another Redditor that I trust and with their help I've written a letter that I'll leave for him when I go. Basically it explains that his actions have severe consequences, and has an open to interpretation but vaguely suicidal ending. Then I'll create a new facebook and abandon my old one (he's still on my friends)

""What about the recording?""

I'm not going to do anything with the recording unless he decides to fuck with my life some more.

""Why not Colorado/Minnesota?"" 

Because I fucking hate snow

""Have you decided where you're going?""

We've settled on Houston, will be leaving as soon as my mother gets her next paycheck. We'll just convoy up and hope to get into a house quickly. My temp agency has offices in Houston that will get me a job fairly quickly.

""OP show pics of Jenny/Jeff"" 

I'm not going to provide any personal information on here, not mine nor anybody else's.

For all of you who gave me words of encouragement/advice; Thank you from the bottom of my heart. If I ever get rich, I'll give all of you puppies or something.

Ok people have been asking for another update, and I live to please: I am still in Cali, we're still going to Texas. We're going to put everything in storage except what we can fit in my car or mom's van, then just convoy up to Houston and find a place to live. We'll probably leave in two weeks. Nothing new on the Jeff front, I've only seen him a few times this last week. I still hide in my room every time he comes home. You can call it petty but I call it not tempting fate. I'll try to update when something happens. 

'Nother update for you guys: We've decided on San Antonio instead of Houston, and will be leaving on the 15th. I've been having kind of a moral dilemma about the goodbye, the note I've written to him might be a bit too far.  I'm trying to find the right combination of words to make him realize what he did was not right, and maybe prevent him from doing it in the future. 

Probably the last update before I move: We're still committed to San Antonio and will be leaving sometime next week, probably on Thursday. We've got a storage shed and have been moving all our shit into it this last week, and my sister's boyfriend has decided to come with us. So we've got another driver and more potential for income. My last day at the temp job is on sunday and I've gotten two different managers to write up letters of recommendation as well as about 6 references. So the odds of my landing a job have gone up significantly. Still haven't been able to sell my football cards so I'll probably just keep them. Also at the request of u/Doctor_Jagermeister I posted my letter to Jeff in the comments. [Here's the link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2bad5k/tifu_by_pretending_to_be_gay/ckg5vh6) I've said it before but I'll say it again;  It's been good having so many people offer up advice and support, I truly wish I could do something for all of you in return. To the people who've offered me a drink or a hug; if I pass through your respective town I'll hit you up! To everybody else; Thank you for being awesome!

Quick update for those still following this: We have not made it to San Antonio just yet. We've had delay after delay and things are not going very well so far. Car problems, money problems and too much road work. We are in Santa Rosa, New Mexico right now and have about 600 miles left to go. We should make it there tomorrow evening if things go smoothly, after that we'll try to get into a house but it will be difficult as we have less money than we expected to, but I'm trying to stay optimistic about everything. 

Another quick update: We went to see houses today with the most kind and benevolent realtor in the country. We are going to submit the application tomorrow and hopefully it won't take very long as staying in a hotel is draining our money at an alarming rate. I've applied for a few jobs and am going to a temp agency tomorrow to see if I can't get anything immediately. Jeff called yesterday and I didn't answer, he left a message crying and basically telling me how sorry he is. I doubt I'll be calling him back any time soon.

Final update: We got into a house, just got our internet turned on today. I'm still working on getting a job but things are looking up for us.

This post won fuck up of the year! I wasn't planning on doing an update but after winning this I feel compelled to do one. So here it is:
Life is pretty good for me now. I made it past the probationary period at my new job. It's probably the best job I've ever had, I love both the work and the co workers and my managers are fucking awesome. Nothing new from Jeff. My old landlord hasn't contacted me so I don't think I'm in trouble for breaking the lease. I think that pretty much sums it up. Thank you guys again for all the awesome shit you do, and I'm sorry if you sent me a PM that I never replied to, I still get too many to reply to without resorting to something generic like ""thanks, you too"".

TLDR: Pretended to be gay to help friend. Found out he wasn't pretending. He was pissed that I turned him down, destroyed my relationships and got me fired. I moved across the country. ",darkruby45

He was older than me, had a sexy Scottish accent, hilariously witty and very out-going. I was thrilled when he left his number on the back of the bill. Fast forward one week: after a few small talk texts we decided to meet up, and agree at 3:00pm at the city fountain, right downtown in a busy area. I arrive a few minutes early, and decide to sit in the shade of a nearby statue and wait. Within seconds an older, relativley handsome guy wearing sunglasses approaches me. ""Hey, it's great to see you!""
I smile and greet him, and he immediatley lunges into some big 5 minute long story about a fender bender he got into on his way driving to meet me, and apologized profusseley for being late. By this point I could clearly tell he didn't have a Scottish accent. ""You don't have nearly as much of an accent that I thought you did, am I crazy?"", he laughed and gave me a weird look, agreeing how I must be crazy because he has never had an accent. We continue walking slowly on the downtown strip, making more small talk. By this point I had a feeling something was off.. I could've sworn the accent was the main reason I had been drawn to him in the first place. When he asks me how to produce my name, as the ""O with the dots"" is relativley uncommon in our country. I say my name (which has the letter O not Ö) and he is immediatley giving me a weird look. We stop in the middle of the pathway surrounded by people walking. He takes off his sunglasses, revealing an unfamiliar face. You're not Ben are you?"" I ask awkwardly, to which he shakes his head. We both burst out in laughter, realizing we clearly fucked up. ""I'm supposed to be meeting a girl I've met online, down bedside that statue at 2:30! She's a redhead but I haven't a picture of her face!"" We speed walk back to the fountain, both almost in tears due to the hilariously embarrassing moment that we found ourselves in. We part ways just before the fountain, and i see my REAL date sitting reading a book. Didnt mention the ridiculous event that happened moments before, and had a terrific date. 

TL;DR  Went on a first date, ended up being the wrong date, found my real date eventually.",-Gorgeous
non_PTSD,"I (22F) have been struggling with my sexuality over the past few years. I've always been the kind of girl who has had a boyfriend / been in straight relationships, although I have fooled around female friends. I've started to accept my desires towards women might be something more than just drunk college hookups. Today I was out at the beach alone, when I stopped by a small local store to pick up a few things. The women behind the counter and I had an almost immediate physical attraction to each other. She was brunette, healthy and beautiful, although clearly older than I was. After spending about twenty minutes chatting and shamelessly flirting it just happened. I found myself saying the words aloud ""Would you like to grab a coffee sometime? You're a beautiful woman and I'd love to get to know you better"". She happily agreed and we arranged to meet after at the store again after her shift was finished next Monday. I couldn't believe it! I found myself truly blown away, not only by her positive response but by the fact I was the one initiating the next meetup and actually had the balls to approach a female in that way. While to my family and friends I am straight in their eyes, I really just wanted to share this moment, even if nothing comes of the date, I just feel so empowered and proud of myself. 

edit: Thanks for all the positive feedback. I'm sorry I don't live up the the grammar nazi's standards. ",-Gorgeous
non_PTSD,"This happened a few years ago and I was living in Zimbabwe at the time, and I was having a pretty bad day, I was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. If youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

Half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
I get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....Then I here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so I wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. SO i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

I explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where I am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and I dont have the best memory so I didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, I take down his number so i can repay him later on. At this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. Im about 100 feet from the house and i see my Son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like Ive been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

I still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


So it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon.
My son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

TL;DR Got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and I somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

So I legitimately just unboxed this thing about 10 minutes ago. I popped the batteries in (2 Efest 18650 3.7V, 35A) and nothing..

Instructions say, as soon as the batteries are inserted the logo should appear and then it will enter shutdown mode. 

I've tried clicking the fire button many many times, switching the battery directions and clicking the pins in and out. Still, nothing..

I have one other suspicion though. When I plug these batteries in to charge, one of the battery lights is constantly green, indicating that it is fully charged, even when I know it's not.. Only thing is, it works perfectly fine in my Tesla mod.

non_PTSD,"My parents have purchased a 5 acre piece of land to build their new home, that process is underway. There is a second 5 acre plot next to the one they purchased, almost identical. They are also interesting buying that land, and encouraged us to consider buying it at one point. They proposed to my wife and I (because we showed interest before) in buying the land and signing the deed over to us, and then letting us make payments to them. The idea here is that it would enable my wife and I to build a home through a homebuilder and not have to deal with a combined land purchase/construction loan and rolling it into a mortgage, which as I understand is a difficult task. 

We were in the market to purchase an older home, but we think this may give us an opportunity to avoid having to build equity at the onset to purchase land and then build a home. I have a lot of home building experience and worked with my parents growing up building our houses (3 in all). 

They have already paid off their 5 acres and are now starting the building process, they proposed that after their house is complete, they will purchase the other 5 acres and pay it off within 1 year, then setup an agreement with us for payment of 10-15 years depending on cost - at an adjusted interest rate so we pay no more than they did. After they sign the deed to us, we would begin the process of finding a home builder (Fortunately they're already working with one and we love the design the builder has come up with). 

We have a great relationship with them, they are close with us and we are all employed and I don't expect this to end up in drama at all. My parents are smart and good people who want the best for us. I think this could be a good opportunity because we will be next to them which would be great, and have a combined 10 acres of land to homestead on. With the added benefit that when they pass, I would inherit 5 acres next to mine with a house on it.

non_PTSD,"My wife and I have decided to start looking for a home in the next 6 months. We put in an application on Quicken loans and were 'preapproved' for the amount requested. We also put in applications with Chase, and one of the local Credit Unions. 

Chase, and the CU both supplied us pre-approvals with interest rates (subject to change). But it at least allows us to stack them up against each other.

Quicken is telling me that nobody in the industry can do this, and it's impossible that they've given me a rate.

What is going on? I know that the rate I was given is subject to change based on my credit/etc at the time of closing, but Quicken was pushing hard to get me to LOOK FOR A HOUSE NOW with THEIR AGENT and that once I make an offer then they would discuss interest rate.

Quicken is treating me like a 6 year old with absolutely no financial knowledge whatsoever, even the people on the phone talk to me like I'm an idiot.

non_PTSD,"I'm new to investing and haven't put down a penny yet. I've just been reading as much as I can and trying to learn a lot. I've read The Four Pillars of Investing and there are some mentions about the Efficient Market Hypothesis. It seems to make sense topically, that the market prices reflect all available information and therefore makes it difficult to reliably ""beat"" the market. 

Then I read The Little Book That Beats the Market and in chapter 5 or 6 there is an interesting question. If a company trades for X today, and then tomorrow trades for 1.5x or -.5x tomorrow, then the companies value must have changed according to investors. He puts it in perspective of a company like General Motors - do they all of the sudden have half the manufacturing costs? Did their sales double overnight?  The author's explanation is that it doesn't matter - people just act crazy.

So the EMH says that prices reflect information accurately and account for value. And the Little Book states that market prices swing wildly for no reason at all.

Am I incorrect in my understanding of these concepts? Or are these just opposing axioms in the investing world?",enolja
non_PTSD,"Hello PF! First of all let me say thanks for all of the great advice over the last couple of years. My wife and I went ~$15,000 in credit card debt, living paycheck-to-paycheck, trouble with multiple collections agencies and a repossession of our car to a much more steady lifestyle with a proper budget with YNAB, an emergency fund (not quite enough yet), and only one credit card left to pay (lowest interest), and my credit score went up from a 525 to 680 as of today. We are lurkers so you would never know how much you helped, but you did!

I have some general questions about our financial future, and which thing to tackle next. We still have some debt and car loans, so I'll post some of our information here.

**Debts:**

1. $7,500 in student loan debt.
2. $13,000 @ 11.99% auto loan, vehicle is worth 8K (My first cool car at age 21! Kill me.)
2. $13,000 @ 3.09% auto loan, vehicle is worth 11,500. 
3. ~$4,000 @ 9% credit card


That is about it for our debt, it was much worse before. We also settled all our collections accounts, and settled the repossession lawsuit. 

In 2015 we made a combined total of $105,000, but we have some major expenses and two children. Our car payments, and insurance alone is about $1,100/month, rent is $1000 a month, and childcare is about $800 a month. Add in groceries, cable internet, cell phones, medical insurance, gasoline, etc, and after putting a little money into our emergency fund we don't have a whole lot left. 

Right now we are over paying our car loans by about ~$50 dollars each. My wife and I are 27 years old, and were starting to think about putting money away for retirement. Are we jumping the gun here, and need to pay off these auto loans first? We would also like to buy a house in 2-3 years, we do have a VA loan available to use because we both served in Iraq. 

I'm just looking for some general advice to help guide the ship, things are back on track but we're getting anxious because now we're at the point where paying down our debt is going to take at least a couple of more years, and we would like to free up some money now to plan our retirement and put away for our two children.

non_PTSD,"I really liked Pound It by food fighter e juice, which is a lemon pound cake. And I really like Lemon in general, but there weren't many recipes for Lemonade Cookie TPA on e-Liquid-Recipes or any other sites I could find. I love the smell of this flavor, but it seems to not have very many fans. One of my favorites is the Lemonade girl scout cookie so I set out to recreate it. I didn't hit the nail on the head exactly, but I've got something very good, and pretty close. 

I have tinkered with this one for a week or so now, and I think it's delicious, give it a try. 

Flavor Total: 13.5%

1. Bavarian Cream (CAP)  2%
2. Frosted Donut (TPA) 1%
3. Graham Cracker (CAP) 1.5%
4. Lemonade Cookie (TPA) 5%
5. Marshmallow (TPA) 2%
6. Sweet Cream (TPA) 2%

I mixed it at around 70/30 VG/PG, and 3mg nic. 


This has a nice lemon taste, without an overload on the cream (I'm sort of sick of X's and cream flavors), I think that Bavarian cream with it's vanilla notes works well, and sweet cream to maintain the desert profile (rather than straight milk or something). I've also added some frosted donut at 1% to get a nice pastry taste, which works great with graham cracker to make a nice cookie flavor without using cake batter or ""sugar cookie"" flavor even though I have it, because they're both very distinct and I don't actually like them that much. The marshmallow was sort of a wild card but I thought it would help create a more cookie-like taste when mixed with graham and frosted donut, I think it works really well. 

Overall this is less cookie-like and more of a sweet lemon bread/desert, but it's not like a cake either, just a sweet soft lemon taste.

Shake and vape for sure, but the lemon will mellow out with a steep, it can be a tad harsh for some people, but I don't find that at all.

non_PTSD,"I haven't posted any reviews of EJuices, mostly because I haven't found anything truly amazing yet. I've vaped a lot of different stuff - some of my favorites include:

1. The Milkman 
2. Cuttwood: Unicorn Milk
3. Plume Juice: Cereal Ninja
4. ANML: Looper

Those are all very good, but I was looking for something sweet that was a little different. Something with some citrus/fresh taste that didn't taste soapy or astringent. Vaping 'Pound It' is identical to taking a bite of a Starbucks Lemon Pound cake. The flavor is the most spot-on that I've tried yet. The inhale is sweet and delicious and the exhale has sweet lemon and cake flavor. I'm using my Subox Mini @ 30-35 watts on .5ohm pre-built coils and this juice has taken over as my ADV. The smell is amazing and the flavor isn't getting old on me at all. 

I would recommend this to anyone looking for something fresh/citrus'y but doesn't normally like plain melon/berry/citrus flavors because they're always a bit soapy or potpourri tasting. By far this is my favorite juice at the moment. I'm not affiliated with them at all, I just had to write something about this juice.

If you're getting a little bored of traditional desert flavors / cinnamon or are looking for a new sweet citrus flavor to try that still has that nice sweetness of cake, do yourself a favor and pick some of this up. It's also decently priced at around $25 / 60ml bottle. ",enolja
non_PTSD,"I've started playing CSGO recently after a very long break from gaming. I used to play 1.6 and Source. My wife and I watched IEM the last two days and I have a couple of criticisms that I think would help get more people to enjoy watching the games. 

1. The constant play-by-play type of casting is totally unnecessary. My wife did not understand any of it because it was too fast paced and used too many map-specific callouts. Most of it was simply describing exactly what we were already looking at. It wasn't helpful for her at all. I did not need it because I can already see that ""Yes, he is in mid doors looking at short"", I don't need to be told this. It would be more helpful to take a slower approach and say things like ""Guardian is watching this position called short with the AWP sniper rifle to stop a rush from the terrorists while his team-mates stack the other bomb-site"".  Also, Instead of saying ""OH MY GOD HE SPRAYED DOWN SO-AND-SO!!!!"" You can say something like ""Nice frag in mid from the terrorists which may open up this position, but he decides to fall back so the team can re-engage in a 5v4 instead of pushing the envelope"". 

2. The analysis desk seems to be copying the prototype analysis desk from traditional sports. 90% of what they said was ""Oh yeah <team x> is very strong on this map, they won it at <event y>"" just before team-x gets destroyed. Their predictions were completely wrong most of the time, and none of them came close to calling the 'round-score' correctly at all. It seems to me that they have no idea who is actually strong on what maps (Probably because the pro teams are pretty strong on all of the maps, and anything could happen at any time). They predicted that TSM would stomp Na'Vi on Dust2, and look what happened. Also, who cares what some guy thinks is going to be the round score? I will watch the actual game to see that. I want to know how a player is performing right now, how the team lineup has changed, who plays what position, what positions are important, and how the team responds to getting in a 1-man-down, or 2-man-down situation. 

3. It would be much more entertaining for casters to actually analyse strategy like: ""In the last event we saw some very strong play on the B-side of the map from Na'Vi, it will be interesting to watch how they perform an execute on the A-site during this tournament, traditionally we have seen a 4-1 split with smokes being dropped in these positions to cut off the counter-terrorists, while another player lurks in the b-side"". My wife was mostly confused at what the casters were saying. Why can't there be a top-down map that they draw on during the pre-game? I would have really appreciated seeing some of the basic strategies being discussed with lines to draw where the T's and CT's normally play, so we know what to expect. 

4. Instead of constantly providing the same incorrect analysis of the games, and usually-incorrect predictions. How about the casters get into a server and show some interesting angles to us at home. Why can't Anders and Semmler be in-game while Natu talks about their positions ""You see Anders holding this angle from Chicken coop gives him great viewpoint of this area here, so expect to see Guardian or Edward playing this key-position, on the other hand Flamie likes to play over here under drop so he can pick up any kills that decide to come his way""



Overall we did enjoy ourselves, but the casters and analysts don't need to be copying traditional sports. E-sports are inherently less predictable and it would be interesting to actually *analyze* the game instead of attempting to make predictions that are usually wrong. ",enolja

non_PTSD,"I work as a Tier 2 cisco network technician. We do implementations/installs of routers and switches in a very large enterprise network. Over 1500 Cisco 4500/6500 switches supporting many thousands of users. I work on the night shift so my job usually is to configure, install the switches/routers, and run cable to the patch panels (beyond that is the infrastrucutre guys) for network implementations. 

Our team uses a lot of different tools to do our job, we have a few different databases to manage outages, configuration files, fiber-mapping, tickets, and some others. All of these tools at the moment are linked-to from a very amateur HTML page that is saved on a network share. 

ALL of our information/links/databases are stored in an archaic windows-folder structure. We use excel spreadsheets for our fiber patch panel mapping. This has led to an truly awesome amount of mis-labeled cables that require constant tracing by hand. To make things worse all attempts at asking the supervisor for better tools to manage fiber-maps are met with remarks like ""We already have a spreadsheet for that"", etc. We have a share-point that has been neglected to the point of gross uselessness, the only thing on there that is useful is the team-schedule but that is just puling from outlook so we don't even need it. The standard method for completing tasks is to navigate to the HTML links-page which stores hard-links to various places on the network file share, which is also in complete disarray. 

My boss is 60 years old and sees absolutely no problem with the way things are done around here. He thinks that having a desktop with 50+ shortcuts is good business practice for the location of files. 

Worse still I'm a contractor, so I've asked to be made a Sharepoint manager so I can attempt to bring things up to speed, I was denied because only real employees are allowed to manage the sharepoint page. 

I'm just venting I guess, but this is so awful. I have to go into work tonight and re-label all of the ""out of date fiber"" my boss things this task will take ~2-3 nights of work. The spreadsheet is so incorrect there is literally no solid piece of information to pivot from so we have to trace 1000's of strands of fiber by hand to get a baseline to trace from. I've told him this will take weeks if not months to complete but he seems to think it will be easy.

I was performing squats and increasing weight all the way to 135 lbs, but realized that my form was *complete and utter shit*. I was good-morning the weight up, I was unable to squat deeply enough, and my back was almost horizontal in an attempt to break parallel, which I was still unable to do and my knees were miles ahead of my toes. 

To fix my squat, instead of doing my barbell squats with ICF, I simply replaced them with Alan Thralls ""How to squat with terrible mobility"" exercises. I did about 3 weeks of band-assisted squats, moved on to goblet squats with heels on plates, and then goblet squats without plates. 

[Alan Thralls Squat Repair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvGr7wXQfwE)

I know it has improved a lot though still *far* from perfect. My question is: Should I go back to doing squat repair goblet squats for a couple more weeks, or keep on track with this? While doing the exercise, it was still very difficult for me to keep the weight on my heels. 

I should add that I am currently cutting, lost about 15 lbs so far. I'm 6'2, 245lbs and eating about 1950 cals/day.

I just finished my week 3 Monday workout, and I was a mess at the gym, tired, unmotivated, and having trouble finishing lifts. I've lost nearly 11 lbs so far and I'm feeling really good about that.

I tore up my shin doing deadlift and started bleeding everywhere too, so I had to leave before doing any accessory lifts.

I am a beginner grower in Washington state. I am about to harvest my first crop of White Widow and the entire experience has been wonderful. Here are a couple of pictures of our first grow so far, I know how you fiends love pictures. 

1 month into flowering
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lSd69AU.jpg?1)

closeup of cola
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/M4hbTXF.jpg?2)

This is 3 plants, grown in [Synergy ""Hybrid Potting Soil""](http://www.supranatural.biz/synergy.html)

Plants were germinated in small cups, transferred to 2-gallon midsize pots, then transferred to 7 gallon large pots, spending apprx 1.5 months at each stage. Each plant was ""topped"" (removing the main cola new-growth) one time each at the 3rd leaf tier. All water came from the tap, we did not check pH.  Plants are kept at 77-83 degrees F, with a relative humidity of about 35-45%

The plants were vegged under a 600-watt metal halide bulb in a pre-manufactured mylar grow tent using a 18/6 light cycle. They were then transferred into an identical flowering tent, under a 600-watt HPS bulb with a 12/12 light cycle. Plants are kept at 77-83 degrees F, with a relative humidity of about 35-45%

No fertilizer was used on these plants what-so-ever. We attempted to use Fox Farm Grow Big, at 25%/50%/75% every other watering, but the plants did not react well. I believe this is because the soil is already adequately nutritious for the plants. They are very happy at the moment. We have not had any bugs or leaf-drop at all, and they are a healthy and rich green throughout.

**Questions for our next grow**

* We want to move our grow into the garage. It is a pretty clean space but there are probably spiders and other bugs, can we safely use a bug-bomb prior to growing in there? 

* Because the previous grow took so long, and we were only able to accomidate 3 fully grown plants, we are *very interested* in trying auto-flowering strains. Can anyone recommend some quality strains? 

* We don't know where to buy our seeds. We live in Washington state, and we want to purchase high-quality auto-flowering strains. I have checked out some of sellers on the wiki, but some personal recommendations would be appreciated. 

* What kind of yields have you seen from auto-flowering strains? We have been quoted at about $1,500 / LB of dry product from our local dispensaries (We are medical patients/growers). And we would like to have a monthly turnover of apprx 1 LB +/- How many plants will we need to achieve this? 

* I'm going to look through the curing process tips in the guide, but any ideas/help would be appreciated. We have not cured marijuana before. 

Thank you for any input you have. Please feel free to critique our methods! We're always looking to improve our product and yield. ",enolja

I have most of my BTC stored on my home desktop computer, using the original BTC-qt client. 

To purchase BTC I use Coinbase and Circle (I just got my invite today, and it's super easy!)

So I have my coinbase wallet and circle wallet as my ""hot wallets"" and my home computer as my ""cold storage"". 

Does anyone have any better ideas of cold-storage? I'm using a VERY strong password right now and I'm afraid I'll forget it. I'm too scared to write it down anywhere, but it's really too big for memory. If for some reason I didn't enter it for a few months, I may forget. 

What do you use? How do I use it?

non_PTSD,"This happened yesterday, so if you're out there bus girl, I want you to know. It's not what you think. 

Yesterday after working a grueling shift at the old internet mines (I'm a network engineer). I got on the bus to go home just like always. Ahead of me in line is a young woman who is looking very pretty, she has red hair and a nice polka-dot blouse. I don't think much of it, but we end up sitting across from each other on the bus. I'm reading something that was on the front page but get the urge to look up and see her face. I had only seen the back of her head before. I glance up and to my delight, she is very pretty! Horray! I have seen one more pretty girl in the world than I did before. 

Except mid-glance she looks up at me. I realize I'm probably slack-jawed and not really paying attention. I look down. I don't really know why, I don't have a problem talking to girls. I have a long time girlfriend and I don't talk to very many women these days. 

I'm feeling a bit sheepish and awkward, so I glance up again for some reason. A second after I do - she looks up at me and catches me starring at her, or at least she thinks I'm starring at her.  She screws up her face a little bit. I'm not even that ugly, oh well. Twice in a row I've been caught slipping. 

None of this matters because the mid-way stop at the park-and-ride is coming up, and usually everyone gets off the bus here. She stands up as the bus stops and I breath in relief. I also stand up in search of a more comfortable seat (The bench seats that face each-other kind of suck). So I'm waiting for people to clear out, and people are getting off the bus. But on today of all days MUCH more people are getting on the bus, much more than usually. Must be a football game tonight or something.

She isn't getting off the bus. She sits by the window in a regular seat. I look around - all of the other seats are being filled quickly. I walk to the back of the bus, nothing. I look around, there is nothing. The universe's cruel game of musical chairs is playing ""Creep"" by Radiohead. I sit down next to her. She looks at me like a deer in the headlights and I think she is actually afraid.

Flash forward 10 minutes and I've moved seats as we are the only two people left on the bus. She is looking over at me regularly, probably making sure I'm not furiously masturbating or something.

Last stop. My stop. Her stop. Our stop. 

We get off the bus, she goes first and stars walking in my house's direction. We slowly walk together, for a few blocks, she keeps checking over her shoulder. She finally turns down a side-street and I think maybe I can relax now. I turn down my street. I breath a sigh of relief, finally the coast is clear and I don't feel like I'm stalking anyone. 

Then she appears, she clearly took a fake-turn to get away from me, and I met up with her on my road. 

She starts running up the steps to MY building and I'm freaking the fuck out like what is happening, am I actually stalking this girl?  I keep walking towards my building, I just want to go home.

She turns and yells at me from the stairs ""Stop fucking following me fucking creep""

This is how I met my new neighbor. ",enolja

I've read the post from Eagle-Eye-Smith and feel like I have an okay understanding of the situation in Gaza and Israel based on that, and various wiki articles, etc. 

My question is not directly related to that conflict, but I am curious about the mind-set of young people in these countries as compared to US citizens.  Do the young people of these places actually care about religious differences, etc? It seems like American's today are very un-concerned with race, color, creed, sexual preference and religion. Young people in America seem to me at least, to be devoid of all religion, ""authentic"" culture, and seem to have diverse groups of friends from different origins around the world. 

How are young people in the Arab world dealing with the influx of other cultures and societies? 

Some things I have observed in American culture:

- Young people do not pray in public or before meals, seemingly ever.
- It is NOT COOL in America to make fun of gays or to be racist. 
- Being an environmentalist is a very good thing to be. Big trucks with V8 engines makes you a dork.
- Violence is not okay, and being a bully will not be met with acceptance from peers.

non_PTSD,"In my 26 years of life, and 10 years as a network operations professional I have never been hacked. Never had to remove malware from my computer, and never had any kind of security issue on any of my machines ever. This does not include having to remove malicious software from my clients and customers machines. Don't be stupid, and don't be the low hanging fruit that gets picked first, and you should be just fine.

Fortunately there is a lot you can do with very little. I'm going to give you some tips on how to never get scammed, robbed, or hacked. I'm sure if I were being targeted directly, it is possible someone could hack me, I'm not Todd Davis hahaha. 

Following at least some of these steps will be extremely helpful. Following all of them should make you pretty safe. 

1. Purchase a router. They aren't expensive and just having one will provide basic NAT, probably a passive firewall, and it will allow you to separate devices and forward ports. 

2. Use a software firewall on your computer. I use Windows Firewall - it isn't perfect, but it's easy to use and good enough. Just turn it on and leave it on.

3. *Purchase* or use a software anti-malware / anti-virus tool. Do not use Norton or McAfee (As a general rule). Do use malwarebytes, do use avast, AVG, and many others. Make sure it scans your computer every night.

4. Do not use Internet Explorer. Use Firefox or Chrome. Even better, use TOR. 

4. Make sure to reboot your computer nightly. I use Windows Task Scheduler which is installed by default on Windows, to do this. If your computer is involved in any late night activities without your knowledge like being part of a bot net. This can help. More importantly it will force updates and patches to apply that require reboots. 

4. Never give out your password to anywhere, to anyone. The word *anyone* includes your idiot boyfriend or girlfriend. If you're married like me, then you need to remind them a portion of your life savings is possibly in that computer. 

5. Use a strong password. It should be at least 12 characters with numbers, letters, special characters, with upper and lower case. It should not be a common word. For years growing up my brothers password was ""warhammerx"" because he liked Warhammer. Now he hates that game and uses secure passwords. 

5. Do update your operating system as often as it pleases. Developers do not create updates that are useless bullshit (for the mos part). This does not apply if your a sysadmin - DO NOT update your software as it pleases in a data center. 

6. Don't download keygens, random shit random people send you, hacks for games you find on youtube, porn from basically anywhere, any kind of software that you find randomly, etc. If a webpage tells you that you need to install something, just ignore it and go away. EVERYTHING is designed to get your money and scam you with direct malware or ad-trap site, etc. 

6. Install ad-block into your browser of choice. This will stop plugins / scripts from randomly being started in the browser. You'll also be able to gaze upon the unscathed beauty of an ad-less internet. You'll also tend to click on less ads, which usually lead to some kind of malware, generally speaking or email list generally speaking.

6. Consider using an encrypted file with a single **very strong password** to store a password file. In this manner - you can make a random password to every login you have, and always use copy and paste. This is very secure and you only need to remember one encryption password. (This is helpful to me, because I have lots of different logins to a lot of different websites. I simply use a heavily encrypted notepad file). 

9. Do not run a server or service off of your main PC where you keep bitcions, etc. Lot's of servers are tested and pretty secure, but some open services and ports that are unnecessary, etc. The more services your computer is hosting on the internet the worse for security. 

7. Use a VPN service when you are doing anything private or illegal in your country. Make sure you use a trusted VPN that keeps no logs of your traffic (for the subpoena that could come). A VPN is a service that routes all of your  network traffic to a remote location before making the actual request of the end service, so your location and actual computer address are masked.  *Side note: ISPs are very incestuous with reselling products to each other wholesale so the ""location"" of an IP address is sometimes completely bogus. Source: I've worked at various ISPs for my working life*

8. Use TOR browser if possible, it will slow your regular traffic down by a factor of 5-15%. However, it will add many layers of security to your web browsing. 

9. Change your passwords every couple of months to something else. Using an encrypted password file and a random password generator will be very secure. Just don't forget that encryption password!

11. If you're charging someone in the tens of thousands of dollars for a product, some acerage, a car,  a website, there is no reason you should not meet with them in person and question them regarding their intentions and or means of payment. If you are doing business with someone, you should trust them. If you're selling something worth hundreds of thousands, setup a dinner or lunch with both of your families or golf with some of their friends and co-workers, etc. Absolutely bring a friend you trust and perhaps even a lawyer. Selling something for that much money without involving more personal vectors is sort of silly IMO. Whatever you have to do so you can trust the people you're doing business with. 


There are probably some more things that I forgot but following these steps will make your online and computing experience secure, exciting, and entertaining for years to come. Happy bitcoining friends!",enolja

I'm a veteran who served in Iraq. I was also a college student and used my hard-earned GI Bill benefits to attend school.
The VA overpaid my education benefit by $278 dollars – after which they began to send notifications and requests for remittance to an incorrect address.

All of this was unknown to me until I found out my federal income tax return had been garnished for the 278 dollars from the U.S. Treasury itself. This is now on my credit report for 7 years and I have been denied a mortgage loan for my family because of it. I am an honest man, and I would be happily willing to suffer this consequence if it were incurred due to my own negligence or a mistake on my behalf. However, because the debt was due to an over payment by the VA themselves, I am not responsible for it – they’re own accounting department is.

I have contacted the VA Education office regarding this issue, as well as the VA Debt Management Center – both offices tell me (after a 20-30 minute hold time) that I must contact the other office. I have spoken with various supervisors at these departments and I’m told the same things by all of them.

non_PTSD,"So I have been setting this prank up for about 3 weeks now, but unfortunately the fruits of my labor came to fruition yesterday. All for the best I guess. 

Background: My wife and I are very healthy and we eat the same thing for breakfast every day, well maybe a solid 350 days a year. It is egg whites and toast. It has got to the point that if I don't eat this for breakfast my entire day feels ""off.""  I put salsa on my eggs while she uses ketchup and she has to have ketchup or else she will not eat breakfast. We have a backup bottle or two in the pantry just in case she runs out. 

3 weeks ago: I notice that her bottle is running pretty low and she has to actively shake the bottle to get the last remnants out. We are pretty earth conscious as well, so nothing goes to waste, use until the last drop! There is still just enough left in the bottle that I can tell she is thinking that she shouldn't recycle it just yet and puts it back into the fridge. I notice this thought process going on in her head and decide I should mess with her. Once we finish up breakfast she goes to get ready. I take one of the full bottles of ketchup and add just enough to the almost empty bottle so that she will have the amount needed for breakfast the next day. Breakfast the next day rolls around and she does the same thing adds ketchup to her breakfast and decides there is just enough to save and puts it back in the fridge. I again refill the bottle with just enough for the next day. I should also mention that she is short, I hid the refill bottle at the top of the pantry so she could not see that it had been opened and used. 

2 weeks ago: After 7 days slyly watching her add ketchup to her breakfast I can begin to see an intrigued look on her face when she is prepping her breakfast. She doesn't say anything, but you can tell she has taken notice of the bottle. This goes on for another 7 days.  

1 week ago: Breakfast continues to go off without a hitch and every time she adds the ketchup to her breakfast she gets a little twinkle in her eye, like she really really wants to say something about it, but doesn't want me to make fun of her being crazy and thinking the ketchup bottle is never ending. To the point that she will look at me, start to say something and then stop herself change the subject and put the bottle away. I have never looked forward to breakfast so much in my entire life! 

All this week: She is on the verge of saying something everyday. Its becoming hard to not laugh while watching her add the ketchup to her eggs, but I am laughing hysterically on the inside. At this point I have used roughly a half bottle of ketchup refilling the other one. [This is all I can imagine when watching her](http://i.giphy.com/5yLgoceFO3BdJW1zvFu.gif) 

Yesterday: She adds ketchup to her breakfast and looks me directly in the eye and dead serious says, ""u/thiscopisadick we have a fucking magical ketchup bottle."" I could not control my laughter and proceed to loose my shit while she tries to explain to me how she has used the exact same bottle of ketchup for 3 weeks and it has been almost ""empty"" the entire time. She now thinks I am laughing because of her belief in magic and she is trying as hard as possible to convince me that she is serious and it IS magic. I proceed to go into the pantry, take out the half empty bottle of ketchup and place it on the counter. It all finally clicks in her head and at that moment the empty ketchup bottle clicked into my head, but don't care because I made a magic ketchup bottle happen so I am essentially Jesus. 

TL;DR made my wife believe we had a magic ketchup bottle, but it hurt just as much as normal bottle when flung at my face. 

Edit #1: WOW GOLD!! YEEOOWW!! Thanks so much everyone! 

Edit #2: Yes you can leave ketchup out of the refrigerator. It doesn't go bad for months given the preservatives, many restaurants do this. It does oxidize eventually, but you can tell from the color change and it tastes a little off. It will not make you sick for a long time! Also, the ketchup bottle was plastic, I did not die. 

Edit #3: To all the people saying bread is not healthy, seeing as I do not have celiac disease my body can process it just fine. It is organic, sprouted grain protein whole wheat. You can find it at a Trader Joe's near you. Also, the egg whites come already separated from the yolk in a container, so they are not being thrown out. 

Edit #4: To all the people saying that this is not a healthy breakfast, I suppose you are the people who put no dressing on salad, which sounds terrible. Using any dressing sparingly will not make the meal unhealthy. My wife is a dietician in a hospital food knowledge is kind of her thing.  

Edit #5: This got WAY more attention than I ever imagined and yes, we do stupid stuff like this all the time to each other. ",ThisCopIsADick

non_PTSD,"We've always had a rocky relationship. My father is the kind of person who is always right even if he's wrong. He also has a very short temper. Random topics will set him off, so it's like walking on eggshells around him.  I know I have a stubborn personality, and I have been watching what I say to him and avoiding arguments. It's tough, but it has helped our relationship. It's just exhausting being around him, though. 
Right now, one of his triggers is Christmas presents. He suggested I get him something around $75. I don't have a job, and not much money on me, so I suggested me and my brother split the cost and buy it. He got super mad saying I'm an ungrateful brat because I won't spend $75 on him. I don't think I'm being unreasonable. If I had the money I would buy it myself. It's the only thing he wants anyway. 
It's gotten to the point where I don't talk to him much because he just flies off the rails on anything and then demands apologies from us for saying things that we never said. It's emotionally draining and I hate coming home from school and having to put up with this. 
We have talked to him about this, but it's always me or my brother's fault for making him mad. I'm trying to improve my attitude, but he's unwilling to change his. I don't know what to.

I take a bite.  It's soft.  It's not a chocolate pretzel, it's fucking shit.  My family is howling with laughter as I run to the bathroom.

Anyway, I was walking home one fall afternoon.  I wasn't paying that much attention to where I was going because I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends and I was still mad about that.  It didn't take long for me to realize I had stormed off in the wrong direction, but I didn't really care because I knew the woods pretty well.  Eventually I would come to a huge oak tree, take a left there, and then I'd be in my backyard.  Soon the oak tree came into view, and as I stepped into the clearing, I froze.  My mind just went blank.  I couldn't process what I was seeing.  From one of the limbs hung a man with his back to me and a rope wrapped around his neck.  I wanted to run away, but I couldn't get my feet to move.  All I could do was watch the back of this man gently sway back and forth.  After standing there for what felt like hours, I finally turned around about to head back the way I had came.  As I turned, though, I heard a voice whisper ""don't forget me.""  I turned back towards the body and screamed.  The man was now facing me.  His face was twisted in grotesque pain.  Dried blood covered his face, but mostly around his eyes, or where his eyes would have been.  The man's mouth hung open, and it almost looked like he was screaming.

Now with these surveys I have always lied. The more I'd fabricate these answers, the more ""valuable"" it makes my opinion. The more valuable my opinion is, the more surveys I get which means more play store credit. If I had been honest, I would not have gotten any surveys much like when I told my friend about the app and never got a survey after his first one. So far, I've received about $35 in Play Store Credit by doing these surveys. 

So this morning, I got a Google Survey on my tablet. It was a 3 question survey. The survey asked if I had ever been to a water park called Kelp Water Parks. I said yes. Then it asked what my favorite slide was. I just chose a random name of a ride and proceeded to the next question.

Only then did I find out it wasn't a survey, but it was designed to fish out people like me. People who lie on their surveys. It told me that the Kelp Water Park didn't exist. Google then proceeded to scold me saying lying is a bad thing and it will most likely not consider me for future surveys. Google caught me lying and left me feeling like I lied to my own father. 

TLDR: Lied to Google. Received a virtual spanking over their survey app. ",honeybadger21

I have an option of getting a Novation Audiohub 2x4 for $80 brand new. I wanted to grab it since it has some features I can use. My PC only has 2 usbs left. One is loose and causes issues with my Impulse keyboard and the other doesn't use power very well. It pulls all the power from my keyboard and mouse which forces me to manually shut my pc off. The fact that this interface has the usb hub and has an external power supply makes it seem like a good idea.

After all the research I've done,  I keep hearing about how loud this unit is for playing live. I don't plan on playing live nor do I want to piss off my old lady at home so I'm unsure what they mean by loud. Does it mean this unit will knock my socks off at a low level with my studio monitors?

My grandpa is in the hospital after having a heart attack this last Sunday  and we're  not sure how bad it is right now. He has surgery in the morning. It could be as bad as having open heart surgery. He's refusing any blood transfusion due to religious purposes and if he doesn't agree to receiving  blood, the doctor won't operate. I've been really scared of that along with the rest of my family.

I guess it's not so much I'm upset over not getting the job. Yeah I'm bummed, but I'm ok with it. Without getting too much into detail on what it was, I'm just going to say it was my last chance to get the job.  I've spent the last 10 years of my life working for it. School, self sponsored certification, interviews, backgrounds, backgrounds, and psych exams just to name a few things I've gone through. It was all for nothing.

It's just I'm kinda screwed. I've got about $20k in debt from various things like my car, school, credit cards, and surprise expenses. I'm thankful for having a full time job in retail (bleh) right now, but over 75% of my income is going to debt I just can't even make a dent in. My job now pays just a tad over minimum and the job I was supposed to get was going to pay over 4 times that. 

I don't know what to do. I have to live at home at 25 which is just an awful situation. I can't even afford to go to the store to get food. I can't  find a job that pays more than what I make in my area.

So no apartment, no vacations, no fun hobbies, not marrying my girl. Just nothing. Just a job in retail where I work in order to be able to afford work. I work so hard at my job. I don't care that I hate the job. I just wish I could at least have my own place without a mountain of debt to face every day. 

No support from my family either. I just get told ""things will work out.""

I was finally able to get one. Every one that I saw that was a fair price was at least a 5 hour drive just to get to it and there was no way I could afford a new one. But I somehow found one in my small ass community for a decent price. I only drove 5 minutes to get it. 

The owners took off $300 of their original asking price and I was able to get it home. The bike is in excellent condition, low miles, well maintained (I did buy a new battery for it) and is the exact model and color I wanted. And it was right there. 

Last minute I was able to pull the funds together and even only drove 5 minutes to get it. It was meant to be. 

I guess this isn't really so much about the scooter. My home situation sucks to where I'm miserable, I have a crap job where I get paid barely above minimum wage, debt to pay off, and a girlfriend and friends who I hardly see.

Yeah I could have paid off some debt or taken a nice trip, or bought a PS4, or bought gotten a new wardrobe. But buying this was the best thing for me. I get freedom to cruise around an amazing area that was almost created for scooters and motorcycles, and relieve the stress in my life.

So I will tell the story from his perspective. 



""So I get to the gas station to get a couple cheap beers when I see a homeless person hanging out. He was old. Like 100 or something. I spent time being homeless so I figured why not help the guy out.

So I ask the guy what I can do to make his day better. The guy tells me he would love beer, but would rather have a new pair of socks. Very simple request so I tell the guy to jump in my car. He smiles and puts his bags in the front seat. We make our way to Kmart.

I get the guy about $5 in socks and drive back to the gas station where he wanted me to drop him back off. The whole time this guy is nice and isn't creepy or anything. So we pull in the gas station and this is where things start to go down hill. 

As soon as I pull in, I hear a siren and see red and blue lights behind me. The officer approached my car and gave some stupid reason for why he pulled me over. Anyways, he asks us to step out of the car. I hadn't done anything wrong and neither did he so we got out of the car.

So the officer asks if he can search my car. I had problems with cops in the past so I just said yes seeing that I knew I had nothing to hide. So sure enough the officer starts going through my car. 

After a few minutes he pulls out the homeless guys bag and takes out a small flask. Turns out it was half full of vodka. Seeing that the flask had alcohol in it turned into a open container violation. The officer detained myself and my new friend. He then found some reason to take us to lock up downtown.

So here I am sitting in an empty room at the jail. It had already been a couple hours when I started to notice how bad I had to piss. So I ask an officer to go the bathroom and he refused. I pestered him several times to go, but he kept refusing. It was so unbearable. By the 4th hour I couldn't control it anymore and pissed myself. I pissed so much that my pants were dripping from the unusual amount of piss. 

So FINALLY, I was released with no way back to my car. So I had to walk my ass all the way back to the gas station in my piss soaked pants when it's 90 degrees out. It was a good 2 or 3 mile walk of shame. 

So I finally get to my car, and drive my now empty bladder along with my defeated pride back home to finally change. From here on out, I think I'll just spare a few dollars instead of chancing another piss fest like I dealt with.""

non_PTSD,"As the post said, I'm going through backgrounds again. I'm filling out my personal history statement and have come up to the previous employment section. I was fired wrongfully (or at least in my opinion) at  a part time job I got after I left my previous department. 

I was not terminated from my previous department, but was unable to afford to continue working for no pay. I was a reserve waiting to get hired, but resigned due to the fact that I couldn't even afford to eat (no exaggeration there). Just a FYI for you guys. 

So I took a part time job and was working there for about a month. I went in one day and was terminated for ""unprofessional conduct"" as my boss explained it. Her reasoning was I came into work tired one day (I never performed poorly on that day), used my phone (even though she was texting and playing games all day long), and I had mentioned to a coworker I wasn't feeling well on another day (I've had stomach problems since I was a child). These were obviously  BS reasons to fire me. 

After doing some investigation, I found out I was most likely terminated so my boss could transfer blame to me. The place I worked at was a store that hadn't opened yet. She kept on screwing around instead of working to open the store for business and the owners were getting upset. 

I'm not exactly worried about this situation since I have a really good work ethic and have been a really good employee at my previous jobs and even one of the best at my current job. I know they will be contacting them, but I'm not worried about it. This was my first termination ever.

So my ZMAX is having issues. I have been using my ZMAX for about a year now and it's starting to give some issues. My Dad got it for me through myvaporstore.com and it's worked very well. He also got me a U-DC510 tank system with some cartos for that guy. Most worked fine, but one or two didn't. 

Fast forward to now.

I needed to buy some new cartos so I went ahead and ordered 2 packs of the Dual Coil 510s with a resistance of 2.5ohm. I had no idea which resistance to order. So out of 10, only 3 of the carts worked fine. I went through those 3 pretty fast since I ran out of liquid and wanted to put different flavors in there. 

Now today I've been sitting her for an hour trying to get them to work. I've mostly been dealing with ones that aren't getting liquid in them. They will fire, but it will just be a burnt taste. I fill the tank, prime them, let it sit, then try to fire it at about 4.4 on the voltage. Burnt taste.

Oh I'm vaping mount baker liquid that is 50/50. 

So I tried changing the voltage levels from 3 all the way up to 5. Still burnt. So I changed the option to watts. I tried several different levels and still nothing. 

I even had a couple cartos that gave an error when loaded onto the ZMAX. It said something like ""1.0o"" on the screen. That's the ones where they don't fire at all. I've looked everywhere and haven't found anything that says what that means. 

So I'm very frustrated lol probably due to a lack of nicotine ;)

Did I get the wrong carts for the tank? Or is that tank even supposed to work with my ZMAX even though it's a 510?

Should I try to get a different tank system like a Vivi Nova? I also read some good reviews on a new tank called the Innokin iClear 30S Type S. 

Or could it be a settings issue? Or is it simply time to bite the bullet and get a new e cig setup?

Thanks to all!!

non_PTSD,"So my company I work at is sending 3 of us to a company training for 5 days tomorrow. I am driving two other guys from my store. I don't know them at all. It's over a 2 hour drive where I'm driving.

 I'm also going to be set up in a hotel room with them for the duration. I'm not really sure what to do seeing I'm not used to sharing a room with another guy. The guy is very loud and high energy so I don't want to be the boring roomie. We are both over 21. 

It's going to be 9-5 days, but I know we're all gonna go out and do stuff afterwards. It's just going out of my comfort zone seeing that I won't know anyone from my carpool and even others from the same training. ",honeybadger21
non_PTSD,"I had a dream last night I was going to jail so it got me thinking what it would be like going to jail for the first time. I've never been to jail besides doing a tour.

I'm mostly curious about those who are first time offenders for low end crimes such as public intoxication, DUI, theft, drug use/possession, and assaults. First time prison experience is welcome as well!
",honeybadger21
non_PTSD,"This is definitely a rant. I just hate living at home. 

To get from my room to anywhere but the bathroom, I have to walk directly in front of my step dad who is on the couch all fucking day. He leaves his feet stretched out so it's very fucking annoying having to step over them each time. I get judged every time I bring food/beer to my room. I also get interrogated anytime I have to leave the house.

There's two bathrooms. A master bath and a regular bath. I was told the regular bath would be for me and guests only. My step dad uses it all the fucking time to shit. He takes fucking forever and he blows it up. He pisses pretty much everywhere but in the toilet and makes a mess. My mom thinks it's me, but I don't make that mess. It pisses me off since he already has his own bathroom, but never uses it since mines more ""convenient.""

I can't play guitar when I want to because it disturbs their TV time. TV time is all fucking day. Same goes for listening to music without headphones. 

The dog is an asshole. He bites my calf (hard) whenever I walk in the house. Sometimes I trip and fall. My mom says it's my fault. 

There's never food here. All they eat is fast food. I don't mind it once in a while, but I generally don't like eating fast food. I can't afford my own food so I can only eat whatever snack stuff there is during the day. I generally feel sick all day since I have no energy. I can't gain weight if I'm not eating and I can't work out without energy. If I complain how there's not food, she says there's plenty of stuff in the fridge. There never is and when I bring it up, she tells me to have toast. 

My mom thinks she is a teenager. All she watches is Twilight and Jersey Shore. My step dad just watches Bonanza and the price is right. 

I often come home at night. It gets very dark and they always turn off the porch light even when I ask them to leave it one. 

The walls are paper thin. My step dad blasts his laptop late at night when watching gun videos on youtube so it keeps me awake. 

The driveway is dirt and gets my car dirty every time someone drives on it. 

The sprinkler system for the backyard runs when I have to take a shower so there's no hot water or pressure. The front yard sprinkler system runs at 12am so it wakes me up and keeps me awake since the lawn is right next to my window. 

It's never nice in my room temperature wise. It's always cold in here even when it's 80+ outside. The hot water doesn't last long in the shower which is about 5 minutes. Mom and step dad are trying to save money so they turn the hot water all the way down. 

The gardeners my landlords contract with come at 7am and make a fuck ton of noise right next to my window.

The sun directly faces my window in the morning so it's freaking bright in here at 6 am. 

I'm embarrassed to have friends over. My step dad is usually in his underwear all day. If he's not doing that, he's sleeping so I'm not allowed to have people over. Actually, if mom and step dad aren't watching TV, they're sleeping so it's quiet time all fucking day and night. 

My girlfriend isn't allowed to stay the night. I'm 23 and am a big boy. My mom says she can't stay because ""she doesn't think it's morally right."" Though when she was my age, her then boyfriend lived with her and has had boyfriends stay with her since she was 17 up until she was married at 35. Anytime we try to have alone time whether for a movie or other activities, mom always comes in and starts interrogating my girlfriend with dumb questions. 

My grandpa and I don't really get along. He always comes over without announcing it and barges into my room to argue with me. I can't leave because he corners me. 

They decided to clean out the garage which meant moving everything from inside the garage to in front of the garage. The stuff has been sitting there for 2 months. We look like a bunch of rednecks. 

Yeah I know I should be thankful. I am. These are all just annoyances. I don't have to pay rent or utilities besides my cell phone. I pay for everything else though (car payment, insurance, doctor visits, bills, etc). I want to move out, but I can't afford it. My girlfriend invited me to move in with her at her dads house, but we're having problems and I've got a feeling we might be done soon. I feel fucking trapped.

So I was browsing it this morning and found a post in M4W for the place where my girlfriend works and her specific job. I read the post and it described her perfectly. I know he is talking about her. He said in the post he has gone there several times in hopes of running into her. That seems really creepy to me.

non_PTSD,"This was over 2 years ago and I still feel really bad. 

I was driving on a back road to my buddies place at night. I wasn't speeding or anything. All of sudden a cat ran out into the street out of nowhere. I slammed on my brakes and even activated the ABS, but that wasn't good enough. 

The cat made it, but the dog that was chasing it didn't. I couldn't stop fast enough. I was only going about 25 mph before I hit the brakes so I probably made contact with the dog at  roughly 15mph. 

I heard the dog scream before I came to a stop. I couldn't see the dog. It was trapped under my car. I sat there for a short amount of time. There was no noise coming from the dog.  I was thinking ""fuck fuck fuck. I just killed someone's dog. There's gonna be dog gore everywhere and I'm gonna get sued. What if the dog belonged to  a child?"" 

So I backed my car up slowly. The dog got up as I stepped out of the car. The dog was in one piece, but started yelping in pain as it tried to run off. It was kicking it's leg in the air probably since it's leg was broken. I tried to catch it, but the dog was somehow faster than me even with a broken leg and ran off into the night. 

I just stood there for a minute still feeling guilty. I was thinking about trying to find it, but I didn't even know what to do. Then this woman with a flashlight came up to me. She asked me what happened. I told her. She said she heard an animal and brakes so she thought there was an accident. I asked her if the dog was hers and she said no. She said there was nothing I could do so I drove off.

It's been a long time, but I still think about it often. I want to hope the dog turned out ok, but I also know sometimes they will be put down. I don't want to think of the dog going off somewhere and starving or being killed by another animal.

This is an interview for my dream job. The one place I've always wanted to work. I had an interview and an excellent shot at this job.

I get in there and everyone is really friendly. They said not to worry about anything and didn't want to stress me out over anything. They also offered me a small cup of water. I didn't plan on drinking any, but I didn't want to be rude so I poured myself a cup of water. 

The cup was one of those paper ones you usually get at the dentist to rinse out. 

So I did well on my interview and was finished. I thanked everyone and went to pick up the water cup because I didn't want to leave my trash. I never drank the water so it was still full. I picked it up and since it had been sitting for 30 minutes, it was super soggy. I was still nervous from the interview so I grabbed it like you would a normal cup for no reason.

The entire contents of the cup went everywhere on the table getting onto papers. They just laughed and said not to worry about it. After I left I saw one of the interviewers going in with paper towels.

non_PTSD,"So I'm in a weird spot. My GF and I have been together for a while and it's been generally a good relationship. For the past few months, I haven't really been happy with our relationship.

She never really wants to go out and do anything. She just texts me and invites me over. I get there and she's in her pajamas watching some show on her computer. I'm usually dressed nice and ready to go do stuff. I ask if she wants to do anything. It's always along the lines of ""watch something on Netflix?"" or ""Make something to eat?"" 

If we don't do that, I'm so bored. She never seems to want to do anything. I just end up going on my phone for as long as I can. We still have sex often and I think it's good, but it seems like it's the only thing I really look forward to anymore. When I'm over at her house, it seems like the only thing that makes things fun for me is breaking into my alcohol stash at her house just to ease my boredom. She never has any suggestions on what to do. It's always a ""I dunno, what do you want to do?""

The whole relationship, I've been coming up with ideas for stuff to do and I'm totally done with pulling all that weight. 

All she talks about is her job and after 20 minutes of that I want to blow my brains out. She's always tired and always has something to complain about. Sometimes it's a headache or her supervisor.  

She never calls. Every time I call she doesn't answer so I send a text which she replies immediately to. I've had better communication with my ex who cheated on me. In the past 2 weeks, I've had better communication with her than I have had with my GF throughout our entire relationship.  

I've been seeing a therapist for unrelated issues and I brought this up. He recommended that we take turns coming up with different date ideas. I brought this up to my GF and I'm pretty sure she wasn't even listening. 

All the other girls I dated wanted to go out and do stuff. My last GF and I were only at home to have sex and sleep. I had so much more fun with other girls and I miss having that fun.

She has no passion in anything, but working. I play guitar and she wanted to learn guitar, so she spent $300 on a guitar that's nicer than mine. I tried teaching her one easy chord and didn't get it. She gave up within a week. I know this is unrelated to our problem, but this is showing me she has no interest in anything other than working. 

My thought right now is to break up with her. I hardly see her anymore and I don't know if I really want to continue a relationship where we're not going anywhere. She's a good person and I don't want to call it quits just because we don't go out and do anything. At the same time, I don't see this getting any better.

non_PTSD,"So for the past 2 months or so, I've going to see a therapist for my depression and anxiety problems. He's a good guy and we get along well. He's helped through a lot and I usually enjoy going to my sessions.

Last week, we got on topic of me seeing my ex and how she went crazy (I had a post on here recently about this situation). I told him about her drug use. She was a pot head when we dated, but after we split she started using some..other things like LSD and god knows what else. 

That's when he started bad mouthing about trees. He started saying how everyone's lives are wrecked from it. How trees can bring up mental issues. How trees keep people down into the ground and stuck to the couch. How trees keep people from living successful and healthy lives. 

He continued saying how I'm a good example of a person who isn't a pot head. I just smiled and nodded. He doesn't know I'm a partaker myself. 

I haven't been smoking for more than 2 months, but since then I have changed my life around. I'm going back to college, got a job, and my relationships are much more improved plus many other things. So much for his lazy stoner theory right?

So my plan is to graduate college, find a good paying job, and have a happy life. When I have these things, I'm going to pay him a visit and tell him how much weed I've been smoking and that it didn't keep me from leading a successful life.

non_PTSD,"So this is the [original](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1e6w2d/if_youre_bored_and_want_to_know_this_ents_story/) post and I had an update because  I contacted my old girlfriend [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1fbhgr/ok_you_guys_i_had_put_a_self_post_on_here/).


And I'm sorry for the length on this so please bear with me on this.

Alright so I saw her and her family last night. Holy shit. So everyone always talks about how they have a crazy ex. Mine really beats that. So I see her and get a hug (It lasted several minutes) and everyone is all happy. Then she walks away just leaving me and her older brother there. He gives me a warning about her. He says that she's been having some issues. Mental issues. 

She's had some serious violent episodes. If you guys are familiar with the 5150 law, it states that if you are a danger to yourself or others, you can be taken into custody for a psych eval. Over the past 3 years since we were together, she's been 5150'd 4 times. All for violence. 

She's always been kinda silly in the head. Not crazy when I was with her. She had more of the Luna Lovegood (Chick from Harry Potter) type of crazy which for some strange reason I'm attracted to lol. It wasn't anything bad, but now she's seriously crazy.  

The brother, Ben, tells me that she's fucked guys and fucked them over just like me. I was the first of the avalanche apparently. She started to lose it right after she cheated on me. Since then, she's quit drinking and all drugs (more than just weed apparently). But when I talked to her, she seemed like she was tripping out on something, but she was clean. She is perma-high. 

So the 3 of us go to the beach. She and I light up a smoke and are just standing there overlooking the ocean by the side of the road. She looks at me and attacks me out of nowhere while I have the cig in my mouth. She puts me into a choke hold to where I can't breathe. So I have to defend myself. I know Krav Maga so I grabbed her leg and put all my weight on her and we fall down this hill. She really starts fighting me now. We're rolling in the dirt right along the side of the road with people driving by and watching. I slip out of her lock and push her face into the dirt while I've got control of her right arm. I calmly say ""Are you done?"" She says nothing and I let go. She stands up as do I. I tell her to give me another cigarette because she broke mine. 

I fucking got into a random physical fight with my ex. I have scratches on my elbows from it and a burn from the cig, but that's it thankfully. 

So we do the beach thing, go back to her house, and later go to the movies. It was the 3 of us and her mom.. I didn't want to sit by her so I sat next to Ben away from her.  So the movie sucked ass and we finally got out at 1230am and head back to her house. Her mom and I started a fire in the backyard and she bought beer for me and her. My ex took off somewhere, but I was enjoying the company of her mom. She's totally cool. I talked about weed a bit and how my opinion has changed. I mentioned I could go for some trees. She says ""Well now that you mention it"" and hands me a freaking pipe with a fresh bowl of greens. So she and I drank and smoked till about 330 in the morning. I had work at 9 and was too fucked to drive. I was invited to stay inside, but between the memories I had from sleeping with my ex (regular sleeping guys) and the fear of being attacked while I slept made me decide to sleep in my car. 

So I'm sleeping in my car and I get a knock on my window at 530 in the morning. It's my ex. I open the door. She asks me if I would have breakfast with her. I said I had work. She also said she was really sorry for what happened earlier. She said how she's really fucked up in the head and needs help. I told her I understood and gave her a hug. She said she wants to try this again and make it better this time. She told me to call her so we can try again later this week.  

So I drive home still a little fucked up both from the drinking and smoking. I'm also a little fucked up from what happened that night. I get home sleep another hour and get ready to head off to work. It was a fucking long ass day at work. I'm so tired right now lol. 

So I've got some serious closure from this. I really think the girl I fell in love is still in my ex somewhere. I could see it in her eyes.  I know that sounds weird, but I just know it. I'm not going to try to get her back to her old ways. I'm not gonna try to fix things. I'm not putting any effort into it. What I'm going to do is be a friend of hers and her family's. I want to help her not because I'm trying to get into her pants, but because I know the girl I fell in love with is trapped in there screaming for help. I will never be with her intimately again, but what my heart truly wants is for her to smile again and her blue eyes to shine again. 

I don't know what happened to her or how she got like this, but I'm really disappointed from it. I'm not disappointed because I didn't get laid last night or she and I didn't click the way I hoped. I'm disappointed because my ex was such a fun and loving person who just loved life. Everyone she's loved has either distanced themselves from her or just left her completely. Now she's just the empty shell of the person that I loved. It's tough for me. I don't know what I can do to help, but I know she has lost all her friends because of her change. I will be her friend no matter how hard it is for me to deal with. 

So that's that guys. I don't think I'll have another update for you, but thanks to everyone who followed. It's a stupid story of mine, but I'm glad I'm sharing it with you guys. 

I do have a request though. Next time you guys smoke, have a smoke for her. Not for the crazy ex, but the girl I was in love with. Like I said, she's trapped and can't get out. You guys don't know her and she doesn't know you, but just have her in your heart like I do. 

TLDR: Met with ex after calling her. Found out she was crazy. Got into a fight with her for no reason. Smoked a bowl with her mom. And I'm going to still be friends with her so I can get her to smile again.  ",honeybadger21
non_PTSD,"[So this is my original post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1e6w2d/if_youre_bored_and_want_to_know_this_ents_story/) 

I'm really fucked up right now guys, so this may get a little sappy for you. But at least I'm high. Fuck.

I don't know when it occurred to me today, but it was probably when I was high. I realized that one day, we will all die. We think of our youth as a everlasting phase. We think we'll all have our six packs, eat all the fast food we want, and have all these adventures for the rest of our lives. That's not true. One day, sooner or later, we will face death. 

That got me to really thinking as I sit here high by myself. What is the number one thing I'm going to regret when I'm on my death bed. Should have I taken that trip to Europe? Should have I joined the military? Should have I gone skydiving? No. Mine wasn't like that. 

Mine was to call her. The girl I mentioned in my post. I thought about what I would regret the most about my life. That was calling the one girl who I loved the most. If I die without trying, will I ever know the outcome? What if I let it go and she is gone forever? What if I live the rest of my life knowing I still love her, but it's too late for us? It was not this day.

This day I got high. I got high because I wanted to be. I got high and wanted to be happy. I got high and fucking called her. 

No answer. I didn't leave a message. 

5 minutes later I get a phone call. It's her. My heart is literally feeling like I just sprinted 5 miles. 

I answer. She doesn't know who called, but I told her. She was happy I called. We talked for 45 minutes. I admitted some parts of how I felt. I hid some others so I wouldn't scare her away. We admitted me missed each other. Over 3 years and me might still have something. 

Highlight of the story? I see her tomorrow. 

I don't know what to expect, but I'm just happy looking forward to some closure or a reignited fire between us. 

Either way, I'm very cautious with it and I'm not taking any shit from her. ",honeybadger21

non_PTSD,"So I'm a medical patient. I'm going camping this weekend with my best friend who also partakes so we decided we were gonna buy about 1/4 of stuff for the weekend. So since delivery is the only way to get medical trees in my area, that's what we decided to do. 

I called two places. One told me that they didn't deliver in my area. I was disappointed because they had purple kush and pineapple express. The other place told me my city doesn't allow dispensaries to operate within the limits. After some quick internet searching, I found it to be true.

So we had to use....other sources to get some supplies. It's fine because my friend knew someone who has good stuff, but that's what really got to me. 

How stupid is it that they ban a legal alternative to buy their medication from a place that's safe, discreet, and pays taxes? It forces people to get their supply from dealers who often sell worse things. Chances of people getting robbed, ripped off, or arrested is zero when going through a legit establishment. 

My city claims having dispensaries operating within city limits will cause  ""problems such as loitering and crime."" Wait a second. So if we can't buy from a dispensary legally, does that mean they'd rather have us go through a dealer which causes loitering and other crimes? I thought their dispensary ban was supposed to eliminate that problem. Christ on a stick....

Sorry guys, I'm just ranting here. 

TLDR: My city council is run by morons with sticks up their asses. ",honeybadger21
non_PTSD,"It all started with a hate for trees. I didn't want anything to do with it. I only heard it was horrible and bad and made you stupid. This all came from people who were conservative and I bought it. 

My hate for weed made it so I cast some good people out of my life. Two notable ones were my childhood friend and girlfriend.

When I was 19, I met this gal. Wow. She was so great. Good looking, totally my type, incredibly fun, great personality, a talented guitar player, and she loved me to death. She said she stopped smoking after we started dating, which she did. I know how much she loved the stuff and for her to stop using for me meant the world to me.

Later on, I found her stash and got into a big fight about it. I ended the conversation with ""It's weed or me."" It was only a few weeks later she cheated on me and we were done. She didn't leave me because of my hate for trees, she left because of my ignorance. 

I remember when she and I got into the fight, her Mom and I talked about it by a fire pit. She tried to explain to me what trees were and I just denied that it was a good thing.

I hated weed even more after that. It just reminded me of her and all I wanted to do was hate her. I began assuming ents were shallow people. 

Just letting her go was not enough. We hung out for a couple days about 6 months down the road and hooked up a couple times. It really caused me some emotional suffering from how much I missed her. I told her I didn't want this. 

I was more torn now because I didn't realize before how much I missed her. I missed everything about her and our relationship. I kept her in my heart by picking up a guitar. Eventually, I decided I wanted to know more about trees.

It started with some online articles, then it led to documentaries such as The Union and How Weed Won the West. I started to understand it a little bit, but it wasn't enough to get me to change my mind.

When I was 20, I went to Hawaii with two of my buddies. On our last day, we hung out with a local surfer guy. He offered us a ride back to the top of the mountain so we wouldn't have to walk. First thing he did when we got back to his truck was take a rip from a bong. He offered us and we kindly declined. At this point, I was ok with weed but still didn't want anything to do with it. 

He took us around an area where the actual Hawaii natives lived. This place was in the middle of a forest and we had to cross a river to get there. He offered us a hit again. I thought about it and decided that I should try it to understand what it's all about. 

I got really high that day. Incredibly high. So high, I have no idea how I managed to get on the right airplane. For the most part, I was uncomfortable with the experience. 

So I finally understood what trees were about and  after partaking, I was ok. This started my acceptance towards trees.

So I decided I wanted a job in govt and never touched the stuff again besides smelling what my buddies had. I loved the smell so much. This happened over the next 3 years. I continued watching documentaries (sometimes the same on several times) hanging around my friends while they would partake. I even lurked around the /r/trees community. 

I would get offered all the time, but would kindly say ""I would, but I can't."" 

I ended up getting my govt job this last December. It was fun and I liked it. It was a solid career with good pay for someone who is 23. Though, I couldn't partake I was still ok with it. I didn't let it get in the way of my friends and I was ok with them partaking in my presence. 

My job ended up getting to the point where I was getting screwed over. I was being promised a large salary, but I wasn't getting paid. I worked full time till the beginning of April where I started getting depression and struggling with anxiety. I wasn't eating, couldn't sleep worth anything, and was going to therapy. I took an extended sick leave and eventually decided to quit and go to college. 

I almost immediately bought my first piece and smoked my first bowl since I was 20. I got my medical card when I visited my Dad and he even sent me home with some Afgoo. 

Since I started partaking, my life is quite different. My anxiety and depression are mostly gone and I'm sleeping so much better. I've had some of the best nights I've ever had just in the past couple weeks. I probably laughed so much this last Friday that it was probably more laughing than I did in the past 6 months combined. 

I made new friends and had new experiences that I never want to let go.

I wrote this because I wanted to share a bit of my journey from anti trees to full on ent. I think that partaking makes me miss my old girlfriend even more. I think that if I called her we'd eventually fall back into a relationship again. I won't because I'm still hurt from her and I'm afraid of getting my hopes up only to be broken. 

If you guys read this far, thanks. I didn't expect anyone to get through a post this long. I know I wouldn't read a post this long, so thanks. 

I'm glad I'm finally over the ignorance and now understand the greatness of this plant that's 100% natural. 

Have not only a great day, but a great life friends. If you have a significant other that you love like I loved mine, hold them and treasure them. If you have friends like mine, hold them and treasure them too because no career is worth throwing them aside for. 

TLDR: I hated trees and lost the love of my life from it. Got over the ignorance and my eyes are now open to the world. 


EDIT: My childhood friend started smoking our sophomore year of high school. I told him off and we haven't talked since. I haven't talked to that GF I had for almost a year. 

EDIT 2: Wow you guys. I'm so happy to hear these comments from you all. They're very uplifting and motivating. I never expected to find such an awesome community on reddit that's this friendly. I expected nothing from this post, but I have learned so much from you all! I hope my experience can somehow help you guys out!

non_PTSD,"Last night, I finally smoked trees. I have smoked before. I did about 3 years ago and got so high that I can't remember most of it. I took the biggest rip of a bong without using the slider. I got really high and overall had a very bad time. I did  not use any trees for the next 3 years. I don't really count that as my first time since I was miserable and I know that's not what trees are supposed to do.

So I've been depressed lately, not sleeping well, having anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. I have wanted to use, but my job isn't exactly a tree friendly job so I didn't use even though I thought it would help.

After some serious consideration and sacrificing that job, I partook last night. My best frient let me use as much as I wanted of whatever I wanted. All my friends were patient while I did my best to corner. 

I took it much slower and eased into it last night and it was great! I felt like I got the whole ""stoner experience"" last night. Everything from munchies to driving all the way across town just to get butter (when we got back, we realized we didn't get any butter) to finding a TV show about gorillas being the most fascinating (and hilarious) thing I've ever seen. 

I did at point have to much when we were hot boxing my buddy's van. Took too big a rip and needed to get outside for fresh air. I wasn't feeling the best after that hit. I was a little nauseated and quite dizzy. I just zoned out on the couch while watching The Hobbit. 

Still not feeling well, when I got home I listened to music while laying in bed. I can't even explain how awesome it was. It felt like the band was personally playing for me in their recording studio. I then passed out and woke up feeling well. It's nice not having a hangover with this stuff! 

So I'm getting my Medical Card tomorrow and some good stuff that I hope to share soon with my now fellow Ents. I'm going to visit my Dad so we can finally smoke together. He's probably mad that my first time was without him! 

I certainly hope I'm welcome in this community!

TLDR: Smoked my ""first"" time. 10/10, would partake again.

non_PTSD,"So I'm pulling a long day, up at 3.30am to get to the airport, pull a full day working in a different country, and head back to the airport for 6pm, just to get back to my bed late, late at night. A looong day. And there's nothing to eat the whole day but 'road food'. 

Even the freaking business lunch that I've been looking forward to is in a low rent cafeteria due to refurbishments at the client's site. 

I hold it together through the day, the occasional grumble silenced by fastidious willpower and an air of professional courtesy, but things are going badly for my guts by the time I'm waving goodbye and getting into the airport taxi. 

Now I'm used to taxis where you sit in the back separated by a screen, but this is more of a private hire situation, and I'm up at the front with the driver. I'm actually irritated that I'm still holding back this storm of gas that's been building through meeting after meeting with no opportunity for release, but for propriety's sake I don't let rip next to the poor cabbie.

Turns out manners are a one way street. We've been driving about five minutes, and this terrible smell hits my nose. The cabbie has ripped one, I can't believe it. 

My eyes are watering, and he just carries on talking about the weather like it hasn't even happened. I figure he's probably embarrased so I don't say anything. But a couple of minutes later, another one. Bam. It's fucking disgusting, I have to close my mouth because the air's thick enough you can basically taste it. But then I'm just breathing through my nose, which is helping nobody. It actually feels like it's burning me. My throat is closing up.

Above all, it seems so deeply unfair.  I'm here maintaining some class, holding back a fart that could jumpstart a second universe, but I'm still breathing the same shit-gas as if I wasn't, courtesy of my filthy cabbie.

I think, fuck it, if this guy goes in for round three I am releasing my demons and letting him take the blame. 

We're five minutes out, and he parks another air biscuit. Fuck you, I think, and I do the deed. 

It's perfectly executed. A silent release of a full day of pressure, every fart has been banked since 9am, and I'm cashing them all in with interest. It's a silent rush of hot air, compressed into ten seconds of pure release. I'm almost surprised you don't hear my rusty knothole slam shut when it finally ends. Mission accomplished. The perfect undercover fart.

I know what you're thinking. How did this go wrong? Didn't gamble and lose? Didn't let out a loud, incriminating trumpet? Didn't puke, or pee, knock his coffee into his lap or set off the passenger airbags? Nope. It all went according to plan. For a moment, I was proud of myself. 

Then the smell hits. I have fucking outdone myself. It's a devastating riposte to what has come before. It hits all the usual notes and adds a hint of burning rubber for effect. It's a spectacular crescendo of wrongful aromas. I can recognise every awful thing I've eaten all day in the mix. It's a fart so carefully matured it could have come with tasting notes, and they would have been one word in length: *Don't*.

Now let me tell you how this was a fuck up.

The electric window slowly slides down next to me, and the cold air hits my face. The cabbie turns to me, with actual tears in his eyes, and says:

""I am so, *so* sorry.""

""Uh... what for?"" I ask innocently.

""That fart,"" he replies eyes wide open, as if it should be obvious. ""I mean, Jeez, everybody farts, we're only human. But *that*... I'm just so sorry.""

He leaves the windows down all the way into the airport, and gives me a discount on the fare.

All the red-eye way home, all I can think is ""I stink so bad, I have made a cabbie apologise"".

So there's this really, really prevalent idea among FAers that 95% of diets fail. 

We don't really need to worry about that, because *it's not true*. There are many reasons why it is not true, and even more reasons why it would be misleading even if it were. 

But the curious thing is that even if it were true, it wouldn't be a reason to give up. It's only ever an excuse. Here's why:

A 95% chance of failure means that your odds of success are 1 in 20. There are plenty of other things with on-paper odds of 1 in 20 that we are all over. And I'm not talking about gambling, either. I'm talking about things that it makes sense to go for. Here are some good examples of things that we should try for, that have reasonably low odds of a good final outcome *on paper*:

* Job applications 
* competitive sports
* following your dreams 
* talking to the hot guy/girl you're crushing on.
* meeting new people

Why does it make sense to try those things, if you will probably fail? Lots of reasons. For example, sometimes:

* you do get more than one shot at success
* you learn or grow by failing
* trying to succeed is better for you than whether you do succeed
* failing is better for you than not trying
* you'll regret not trying more than you regret not succeeding
* trying can be fun, if you look at it a different way.
* failure is simply not an option that you can respect yourself for choosing.

But the most important thing of all is that a lot of times it isn't a gamble at all. 

**YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE OUTCOME.** 

Effort **DOES** matter. 

Think job applications. 

Did you know that in a job with 20 applicants, you have a 95% chance of not getting hired? Pretty disheartening, huh?

Except, of course, that those are just numbers. Those applicants don't all have equal odds. And you can affect your own odds, with a little self-application. Most people won't, though. Half of those applications will be from people who literally didn't *try* to make an impression. They're out. Make any kind of effort at all, and suddenly your odds are 1 in 10. 

Five people don't have the knowledge to do the job. They won't get it. As long as you're not one of them, your odds are now 1 in 5.

Two of the remaining people going for the job have got the skills to do it. But - guess what - they don't have the skills to write a good CV. They're on the back burner, because they didn't do their homework. Uh oh. You're now in with a 1 in 3 chance of success.

One of the others looks good on paper, but interviews for shit. But not you - you've practiced with your roommate every night for a straight month, and you can smile and give the right answers with your eyes closed - except that you won't, because you learned to make eye contact when laying it all out.

And before you know it, you've got a fifty-fifty shot at the title, and the outcome may still depend on how much extra effort you put in. 

Someone with Fatlogic looks at the 95% number and says 'I might as well not even try.'

Ca you imagine that in the job example? ""I might as well not have a job. Fuck all you lucky guys with money privilege."" (Arguably the single greatest privilege, lol). 

Someone who wants, and deserves, to succeed asks 'How can I get on the right side of that number? What difference can I make?' 

And the answer is, a lot. Sure, it takes effort. You won't even know how much when you start. And you might have a natural disadvantage. And you might need to try harder than another applicant. And it won't always be fair. And it will never be easy. 

Because if it was easy, everyone would be doing it.

And you can't learn a new skill overnight, and you can't learn a new way of life overnight. And if you're the kind of person who quits when something isn't immediately going your way, then you're probably not the kind of person who succeeds at much. 

But even if you are that kind of person, the choice is still the same: do you want to be someone who succeeds, or not? 

If you want something, then you make the effort. And a lot of the time you get there. And you certainly get to better odds than 1 in 20. 

But if you don't make the effort then all you are is someone who didn't try. If you want respect for that, you're barking up the wrong tree. 

People who haven't ever really tried are really easy to spot, because they're the ones that don't recognise effort. 

That's what we see in the people with Fatlogic. That's the thing we all chuckle at, and shake our heads with wonder, and it's the thing that keeps us coming back to this sub: people who know so little about making an effort that they don't know what an effort looks like in the first place.",Quilf

I'm trying to estimate my return for 2015 and have a few questions, with the main one being the one mentioned in the title.

For reference, I'm in the U.S. and am in Florida so no state taxes.

Question 1.

My wife and I have been living together since Dec. 2014 but did not get married until Oct. 2015. Can we file a joint return for the whole year, none of the year, or is it pro-rated somehow? I have the original lease with both our names if proof of cohabitation is necessary.

Question 2.

In February, I started learning programming with the intent of releasing an app and hopefully getting income from it this year. My costs include 2 second-hand macbooks ($280 and $500, both were bought explicitly for the purpose of learning programming and creating apps), an Apple Developer account ($99) as well as a few Udemy courses, all of which were geared towards iOS programming (total $145). This totals out to $1,024.00 in expenses. Which, if any, of these can be claimed is a deduction? I don't know if it matters, though, as entering this into H&R Block's tax estimate website made no difference to the expected return

            }
            
        }
        
    }

On the QuestionView, right now I have 3 text fields and a segmented control for first name, last name, age, and sex. I have a ""Save"" button with the following code.

    @IBAction func buttonSavePressed(sender: AnyObject) {
        
        questionnaire[""UserName""] = currentUser!.username
        
        questionnaire[""Password""] = currentUser?.password
        
        questionnaire[""User""] = currentUser
        
        questionnaire[""FirstName""] = textfieldFirst.text
        
        questionnaire[""LastName""] = textfieldLast.text
        
        questionnaire[""Age""] = textfieldAge.text
        
        if(segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex == 0)
        {
            questionnaire[""Sex""] = ""Male""
        }
        else if(segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex == 1)
        {
            questionnaire[""Sex""] = ""Female""
        }
        else if(segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex == 2)
        {
            questionnaire[""Sex""] = ""Other""
        }
        questionnaire.saveInBackgroundWithBlock {
            (success: Bool, error: NSError?) -> Void in
            if (success) {
                print(""Success"")
                
                self.questionnaire[""userID""] = self.questionnaire.objectId
                
                self.userID = self.questionnaire.objectId
                
            } else {
                print(""Failure"")
            }
        }
        
    }

After signing up a new account, I can fill in all the information, hit save, and it uploads to parse. I can change information, hit save again, and the object updates in parse. After logging into an existing account, this just causes a crash (I have tried clean/clean build/etc.)

I also have an update button with the following code (I will eventually have the code merged into one button but I'm trying to test the two separately for now)

    @IBAction func buttonUpdatePressed(sender: AnyObject) {

        let query = PFQuery(className:""Questionnaire"")
        query.getObjectInBackgroundWithId(self.userID!) {
            (questionnaire: PFObject?, error: NSError?) -> Void in

            if error != nil {
                print(error)
            } else if let questionnaire = questionnaire {
                
                
                questionnaire[""UserName""] = self.currentUser!.username
                
                questionnaire[""Password""] = self.currentUser?.password
                
                questionnaire[""User""] = self.currentUser
                
                questionnaire[""FirstName""] = self.textfieldFirst.text
                
                questionnaire[""LastName""] = self.textfieldLast.text
                
                questionnaire[""Age""] = self.textfieldAge.text
                
                if(self.segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex == 0)
                {
                    questionnaire[""Sex""] = ""Male""
                }
                else if(self.segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex == 1)
                {
                    questionnaire[""Sex""] = ""Female""
                }
                else if(self.segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex == 2)
                {
                    questionnaire[""Sex""] = ""Other""
                }
                questionnaire.saveInBackground()
                
            }
            
         }

      }

This also works after the initial signup and saving the initial data. After logging in from an existing account, this does nothing (occasionally gives me an error code 101 no results matched the query). 

In viewDidLoad, I bring all user data in with the following code and can confirm it works because the textfields and segmented control automatically show what the user had saved before:

        let query = PFQuery(className:""Questionnaire"")
        query.whereKey(""User"", equalTo:currentUser!)
        query.findObjectsInBackgroundWithBlock {
            (objects: [PFObject]?, error: NSError?) -> Void in
            
            if error == nil {
                // The find succeeded.
                print(""Successfully retrieved \(objects!.count) object(s)."")
                // Do something with the found objects
                if let objects = objects {
                    for object in objects {
                        
                        self.userID = ""\(object.objectForKey(""userID"")!)""
                        
                        self.textfieldFirst.text = ""\(object.objectForKey(""FirstName"")!)""
                        
                        self.textfieldLast.text = ""\(object.objectForKey(""LastName"")!)""
                        
                        self.textfieldAge.text = ""\(object.objectForKey(""Age"")!)""
                        
                        if object.objectForKey(""Sex"")! as! String == ""Male"" {
                            
                            self.segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex = 0
                            
                        } else if object.objectForKey(""Sex"")! as! String == ""Female"" {
                            
                            self.segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex = 1
                            
                        } else if object.objectForKey(""Sex"")! as! String == ""Other"" {
                            
                            self.segmentSex.selectedSegmentIndex = 2
                            
                        }
                    }
                }
            } else {
                // Log details of the failure
                print(""Error: \(error!) \(error!.userInfo)"")
            }
        }

I know this is kind of a lot of code to go through but I just can't figure out why both buttons work after signing up but not after logging in and it's just confusing.

Thanks for any help you can offer

That was almost 6 years ago and I've been vaping for the past 3. I was thinking about it this morning and realized that if I had kept smoking, it could have killed me by now and there's no way of knowing it.

non_PTSD,"I used to constantly overdraft my bank account, which sucks. Not only does the bank charge you, but if you were trying to pay a bill, they would slap with with an NSF (non-sufficient funds) charge as well.

This would always happen because:

1. I would pay my bills online, then I would check my bank balance a few days later, not knowing the bill hadn't been processed yet, and end up spending too much

2. I would forget about a recurring monthly charge

*****

About a year ago I opened a second checking account and I have had this issue 0 times since then and I thought I would share my process.

1. I have a spreadsheet of all my bills
 - I get paid on the 5th and the 20th, so I have them separated by which payday they come after.

2. The very morning I get paid, I look at the spreadsheet, add up the total of all my bills, and move that exact amount into my other checking account.
 - Note: For bills that regularly change (like utility bills), you should be able to see your bill by now and adjust your projection to the actual amount.

3. I then go through the process of paying everything online
 - After submitting my payment, I highlight the cell yellow on the spreadsheet so I don't second-guess myself later
 - If a bill is an automatic payment that won't come out until later in the month, I highlight it blue to acknowledge that the money is in the account and that I need to check back and make sure it was charged when the time comes, at which point I highlight it yellow for paid.

4. Sit back and relax. I know my bills are covered and I can't accidentally spend the money.

[Here is a screenshot of my spreadsheet, with hopefully any sensitive data censored out.](http://imgur.com/ayqGkWx) 

As you can see this is also helpful for keeping track of how much spending money I will have left over in case I want to make a large purchase or cover a random expense that popped up.

If any of you out there are actually gaining momentum with your projects and money is coming in (or going out), call me, your new accounting and finance guy! I'm willing to help and give advice free of charge, just keep me in mind when you make it big and need a full time accountant (or at least a regular consultant).

I have experience in many industries and have **a lot** of experience with startups and very small companies, including setting everything up from scratch.

Just hit me up with any questions or a brief explanation of what you need help with and I'll let you know what I can (or can't) do.

Disclaimer: I am located in the U.S. Accounting in the U.S. can be wildly different than accounting in any other country. However, thus usually only matters if you are a publicly traded company and when it comes time to file taxes.

On my first day in the ICU, I received an emergency chest tube. Due to the severity of the situation, there was no time to prep, no time to put me under, no time to apply anesthetics. This was the most painful and scary moment of my entire life but that is a whole long story of it's own.

During my hospital stay, I underwent surgery where they cut into my lung to scrape all the fluid out ([called a thoracotomy: warning, gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy)) and was given 2 new chest tubes. Miraculously, I was discharged a week later with about 40-50 staples in my back and some **very** strong pain meds to be refilled every two weeks.

Two weeks later (just after getting a fresh bottle of pain meds), I went in for a check up with the doctor. He wanted me to pee in a cup so they could see if the medicine was having any effect on my liver. I peed in the cup and all was well.

Are you ready for the fuck up?

I woke up. 

The entire doctor's visit was a very vivid dream. What happened IRL was I got up in the middle of the night, opened my full bottle of pills, and peed in it. By the morning, it was just a sludge of pills that had dissolved into a chalky piss-sludge. I was devastated.

Because I had been given such a strong dose of a highly controlled pill, they could not give me another prescription, so I was stuck in horrible pain (while trying to catch up with my courses) until I could order my scheduled refill.

**What do I need?** 

[EnChroma](http://enchroma.com/) glasses

**What do they do?**

Help colorblind people see color. Their [website](http://enchroma.com/category/videos/) has lots of video examples of people putting them on for the first time, you can also refer to [this popular reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3dh15r/colorblind_man_sees_purple_for_the_first_time/) for a good example of what it does.

**Why do I want them?**

I am getting married in October and REALLY want to see my bride and the decorations in full color on such a special day.

They are also helpful for personal/public safety scenarios such as driving. 

**HOW I WILL PAY BACK**

2 options

1. $200 on 8/5 and $315 on 9/5 to equal 515. This is a total return of $65 and 14.444%

2. $140 on the 5th of each month for 4 months to equal to 560. This is a total return of $110 and 24.444% to accommodate for the longer payback time.

**Other relevant info**

- Location: Gainesville, FL, USA

- Payment Method: Paypal

- Sidenote: According to a test on their website, I am a ""Strong Protan"" meaning there is about a 50% chance these glasses will be effective. Because of this, the company has a 30 day 100% return policy. If this is the case, I will return the glasses, pay back the full amount, and still provide the agreed upon interest amount.

- Sidenote 2: These glasses are on backorder with an estimated time of 4-6 weeks, not including shipping time, according to their website. With my wedding being only 2 months away, ordering these as soon as possible is a huge priority.

Feel free to ask me any questions, as I'm trying to be as transparent as possible with this whole process.

I usually work the swings so I was dead tired by 0530.  I was doing police dispatch and unusually, our department has the PD dispatchers pick up 911's as well as the calltakers (most dont).  For good reason.

At 0530, I was working a burglary in progress on the radio and without even thinking I picked up a 911.  I love answering the phones.  911 lines are my favorite.  Were, anyway.  

Long story short, I mistyped the address while trying to respond to my officers on the radio.  The call was for a 48 year old male, conscious and breathing but with chest pain.  4600 and 6400 on this street aren't too far from each other, but they are seperated by a river, so the fire crews had to go all the way south to the nearest bridge, head eat on the bridge then back north to the street and address.  

the delay was 14 minutes.  fourteen agonizing, awful minutes.  because after i called them back to get the correct address, they called back a minute later saying he was not conscious anymore.  And he died.  

Not sure how I feel right now, or if it even matters how I feel.  That guys family just lost him because of my human error.  my stupid fucking inattention to the most basic thing about my profession.  GET YOUR FUCKING ADDRESSES RIGHT.

non_PTSD,"We have these nights with random waking, before night concedes to daylight breaking,


when we aren't exactly clear 
what woke us in such panicked fear 
but sensing hateful malice near.


It stands outside the bedroom door.


Its greasy hair is lank and thinning, and broken teeth fill wide mouth grinning,

it sees the chest both fall and rise 
with boiling hate in hollow eyes 
the peaceful sleep it does despise.


It stands outside the bedroom door.


It thinks back to when it last slumbered, it seems so long it can't be numbered.

Such hate it has for those who sleep, 
its fingers round a sharp blade creep, 
and with an almost joyful leap,

it steps upon the bedroom floor.


Evil delights dance through its brain, which only add to its disdain,

Eternal waking to avenge 
Such satisfaction in revenge 
Then maybe it could sleep again


It steps into the bedroom more


The voices in its head start talking, as it begins its gleeful stalking,

with planned and careful silent strides 
across the bedroom floor it glides 
and ponders ripping out insides.


It moves across the bedroom floor.


Putrid malice fills the air, rage replaces its despair

Its mind with wicked thoughts is teeming 
As innocence lies gently dreaming 
It’s jagged knife in moonlight gleaming


Its soul craves anguish, blood and gore.


The very thing that it detests, looks so peaceful as it rests,

But short should any peace remain, 
When it’s thrown from where it’s lain 
When knife scrapes bone with burning pain


Hate and loathing fills its core.


Its thoughts then turn to its next action, with rabid sense of satisfaction,

“smash its ribs up, break them all” 
“dash it’s head against the wall” 
“not much blood in things that small”


The voices, louder, wanted more


“How can we cause the utmost harm?” “Stand on its chest and rip it’s arms”

“Push its head down, cut a line, 
from back of neck to base of spine, 
Drink its blood like altar wine”


So many voices, such furore


Pure evilness the voices coaching, at bedside it was fast approaching

“This is it” claimed voices raking, 
“end its life, it’s there for taking, 
Then have the rest for which you’re aching”


Its mind belonged to it no more.


Excitement now was uncontained, a simple task all that remained

Cut the throat and cut it deep 
Watch the blood begin to seep 
And finally lay down to sleep


Repugnance oozed from every pore.


It dances almost giddily, the thought of pain brings it such glee,

it stands and stares into the bed, 
and brings the knife above its head, 
but suddenly it senses dread.


Screaming voices were no more.


There's only one voice that remains, a mother's voice so filled with pain.

Sleepless voices drove her wild, 
prepared to kill her only child. 
It’s sleeping face so pure and mild 
Left his mother’s heart beguiled 
But as her saneness reconciled 
one more voice caused her to smile:

So, me being the absolute evil genius that I am, entered a text shortcut so that when she typed the word 'Jay' (which is her husbands name) it would come up 'you're a fat bitch! Lol jk'. I know this is hardly an imaginative prank, and an infantile text, she would try and text her husband 'Hi Jay' and it would come up 'Hi you're a fat bitch! lol jk' which seemed like a pretty harmless joke that he wouldn't really be offended by. So I sit back to wait for the outcome.

Fast forward a couple of hours and I hear an ungodly hammering of my front door. I answer the door and she shoves past me, ""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY PHONE?!?!"" I am completely taken aback by how angry she is and was like ""Sorry Kelly, it was only a joke, was Jay pissed off?"" to which she replied ""I didn't fucking text Jay, my friend's mum had just died, I wrote to her on facebook to say 'So sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love Kelly and Jay'"" What she had actually written was ""So sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love Kelly and you're a fat bitch! lol jk""

When I was about 6 I had a friend from school who wasn't quite with it. I'd been lumbered with him as a result of my mum and his mum working together. His mum was really worried about him and felt that he was acting strangely because he had no friends. When I say acting strangely, he had recently collected all of his parents' clothes in the front room and set them on fire, then sat by the window waiting for superman to arrive. ""Strange behaviour"".

So he's at my house one day and we're playing some stupid superhero game when he comes out with, 'You know The Flash? I can actually run faster than him.' So I call bullshit and he says, 'No seriously, I haven't shown anyone because I don't want them to take me away and do experiments, but I'll show you if you promise to keep it secret.' So my 6 year old brain is now becoming slightly more convinced and he suggests as means of proof that we should get my hamster, bring it to the top of the stairs, throw it down and he would super-fast race down and catch it before it hit the ground. So off we pop, hamster in tow, he throws it down the stairs, before he even takes ONE step it smacks against the wall at the bottom. I stared at him for a few seconds in utter shock. I have a sobering moment of clarity thinking 'of course he couldn't do it, why the FUCK did I think he could?' I burst out crying, mum comes out, sees dead hamster, I never see that kid again.

non_PTSD,"This literally just happened in the last half hour and I'm still kind of in shock/ confused. So I've been chatting with this girl on Tinder for the past couple days and things were going well. Tonight she suggests that I come over to watch a movie and cuddle. I accept the invitation since all I was doing was watching the finale of True Detective and this season has been confusing enough. I make it to her apartment complex when suddenly my phone dies, that should have been the sign right there. I run to the gas station to buy a charger since I already drove out there and I'm committed to this cuddle. I get into her apartment and everything seems normal, we go strait to her room since her roommate (a dude) was in the shower right next to the living room. Not even a few minutes into the movie we start making out and it starts getting a little toasty. While were kissing she keeps getting texts and going out to talk to her roommate a couple times which I thought was odd. She comes back in and takes off my shirt and then says, ""I want you to fuck me right now"". It catches me off guard since I didn't take her for the type. I knew something was up at this point so I tell her that she was going a little fast for me. I hear the shower stop in the other room and then she says, ""do you mind if my roommate joins in?"" That isn't really what I had in mind and get up a little startled when suddenly roommate guy barges in balls naked and says, ""I'm going to pound you into the ground, I'm going to pound you into the fucking ground."" As he gazed into my eyes my dong went limp and I proceed to sprint out of the apartment as fast as I could with my shoes and shirt in one hand. As I'm running out he yells, ""I'm going to track you down, you better run I'm coming after you."" I didn't look back and ran as fast as I could to my car in shock and disbelief that something like that actually happened to me. Needless to say I'm going to take a break from Tinder for a little while.

Edit: I'm glad many of you are concerned about my wallet, it was in the car the entire time so its safe! As soon as I go to lunch I'm going to report her to Tinder and get her account banned. More importantly I will be filing a report with the police, I realize this could have gone way worse for me and I don't want anyone else walking into that situation if its a set up/ scam.

UPDATE: So as I was enjoying my Chick-fil-A at lunch I received a text from her, let me know what you think still seems kind of sketchy. ""I have no words to say how sorry I am about last night. That guy is an ex of mine and he kept threatening me until I came over and drank with him. he got me really drunk and got on my tinder and was actually texting you from his phone. He told me I couldn't go home until you came over and I convinced you to have a three some. Thank you for not taking advantage of me. I was scared shitless and I know he freaked you out too.

So I transferred in as a 10th grader from South Korea, into a 9th-12th boarding school in the US. 
Because it was a boarding school, I had a roommate, with whom I had only exchanged a couple emails before coming to the school.

The first day of school came, and I got to my room. The room had a bunk-bed, and having arrived first, I took the bottom bunk, and started unpacking.

Soon after, I heard a knock on the door. It was my roommate and his dad.
We exchanged greetings, and were busy unpacking, until it was time to go have lunch, meet new people, and do what high schoolers do on their first day of school.
The first day of school went by before I knew it, but I didn't really get to hang out with my roommate that much, as we were supposed mingle with everybody in our grade.
It was soon lights-out, so I climbed into my bottom bunk, and my roommate climbed up to his top bunk. We exchanged good-nights, and prepared for bed.

And then I started my daily 50 sit-ups.
*Huff-puff*, *Pant*, *Grunt*,
*Finish with an obligatory 'ahhh' from the burn*

I had been doing 50 sit-ups daily before going to bed for about a year then, and the first day of school was no reason to break my habit.
I was kind of afraid that I would wake my roommate, but he didn't say anything, and it sounded like he was asleep. So I thought nothing of it, and went to bed.

This goes on for a couple days, and one day my roommate carefully asks me without looking down from his bed, ""Umm...are you alright, bro?""
To which I respond while heavily breathing, ""Yeah!""-pant-""I'm fine. Just doing my daily routine, you know? - pant""
To this my roommate responds, ""Uh...s..sure..""

I shrug it off, and go to bed.

About a week later, in the middle of my sit-ups, I hear a creaking sound on top of my bed, and from my bottom bunk, I can see my roommate's hands and the top of his head slowly starting to surface from the edge of his bed.
He starts to peek down at my bed, but with eyes so white, that you'd think that he heard somebody get brutally murdered.

I casually continue my sit-ups as usual, and ask, ""What's"", pant, ""up?""

Suddenly, I see a wave of relief wash over his face. His expression rapidly changes from fear to realization, to relief, and then to laughter.

""OH MY GOD, YOU WERE DOING SIT-UPS. Oh, thank GOD!""
""What did you"", grunt, ""think I was doing?""
""I totally thought you were furiously jacking yourself off every single night before bed! I thought you would come up to my bed and rape me while I was asleep or something..I had been thinking that I was rooming with an Asian sexual deviant..""

And then it hit me. His previous comments. The dreadful silence every night.
My roommate acting strange around me.

For more than two weeks, my roommate had been thinking that my daily sit-ups had been daily me-time sessions, complete with my huffing and puffing, grunting, and ahhh's. For more than two weeks, my roommate had been laying awake on his top bunk, hearing me panting and grunting down on the lower bed, only imagining me getting myself off, not daring to look down for a fear of witnessing something unspeakable.

We had a great laugh, and we still talk about it every once in a while.

**tl;dr** - Went to boarding school, had a roommate with whom I shared a bunk-bed. I slept on the lower bed, he on the top bed. Every night, I did sit-ups before going to bed. For 2 weeks, my roommate thought that I had been furiously getting myself off.

**edit**: What, front-page? I will be enjoying my short-lived reddit fame. To answer some frequently asked questions:

* Yes, I know sit-ups aren't very effective, especially when done on a soft surface. I didn't know anything about fitness back then, and had mistakenly thought, 'Abs? Must do sit-ups, since I am moving my stomach!' I also progressively worked my way up to 50, from 10 a night. I also don't do any sit-ups now, in bed or on the floor.

* The bunk-beds at our school had enough space for sit-ups on the lower bed, but just barely.

non_PTSD,"Noticed it while playing final Bullseye today. 
I always took advantage of the bug (simply because it's less time taken out of my day), but today I decided to just have fun toying Bullseye with my 5* Malekith. 

Then I saw that Malekith is no longer immune to movement slow :(

When did this happen?",imjms737
non_PTSD,"So I was playing Bullseye with my Spidey who has a 51.6% dodge rate in multiplay today, and noticed he didn't dodge as nearly as many times as he should have.
As a matter of fact, I don't remember him dodging attacks at all. (This may be just me not noticing)

I started to pay attention to how much he dodged, and I saw that Spidey got hit 5/5 times with Bulleye's rapid card-throwing skill.

Under a binomial distribution, the probability of getting hit 5 times out of 5 with a dodge rate of 51.6% is a mere 0.02655992, or 2.65%.
Still possible, but extremely unlikely. 
(Statistically speaking, this would lead me to reject the claim that Spidey's dodge rate is indeed 51.6% with a 5% significance level)

I've also noticed that my 5* WM gets stunned by Destroyer, despite his passive.

Are the rules of the game different for multiplay? Has anybody else observed similar results?",imjms737

non_PTSD,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year now.
We have been living together for over 7 months, and things are pretty great. She recently graduated college, and got a job as a fund manager at an asset management company in April 2015.

Keep in mind that we live in Japan, and we are South Korean, so her being a female foreigner working in the Japanese financial industry can be quite stressful for her. And both of our parents live in South Korea.

And recently, she has been suffering short-term memory loss, and I am very concerned for her health. 

How it usually happens, is:

1. She gets emotionally upset at something.
2. She starts crying and then falls dead asleep.
3. She wakes up with a sudden jolt.
4. She doesn't remember when she fell asleep or the fact that she had been crying for the last hour or more.
5. I tell her what happened, and she (understandably) gets very upset.

When she wakes up, she doesn't remember why she was crying, and sometimes about things that happened earlier that day (give or take 1 - 5 hours from the moment she started crying). Sometimes the cycle repeats, and she doesn't remember her having had memory loss.

However, today, she cried, fell asleep, woke up and totally forgot about the fact that we had been raising a cat for the last 3 weeks. She was taken back from the picture of us and our cat that we have hanging on the wall, and freaked out when she saw our cat playing on the floor. I asked her if it was her first time seeing the cat, and asked if she knew what our cat's name was.
She couldn't recall her name, and the look in her eyes said that it was her first time seeing our cat.
This was the first time she couldn't remember something that had been going on for the last couple weeks and not something that happened that day, and it's got me worried for her health even more.

I think a lot of it has to do with the stress she gets at work, so I've asked her to seriously consider quitting her job if she does not see any improvements in her symptoms in the next couple months. She said she would consider it, but she's probably going to take action in December in the earliest (for a couple of reasons that are not very relevant to my questions). She also went to the doctors, and was told that it was 'occipital neuralgia', and got an anesthetic injection in her head. She felt better at the time, but it was only temporary.

I am basically the only one who knows about her memory loss problems, and I think I should tell either her parents (she's especially close to her mom) or her boss about her health. But she doesn't want me to tell anybody, as she's afraid that she would cause unnecessary concern for others, and that she may let other people down.

Should I tell anybody about my girlfriend's problems, or should I wait until December, when she will probably quit her job?
If I should tell somebody, who should it be? Her mom? Dad? Both? Her friends? Her co-workers or manager?",imjms737

When running the same daily 5th mission, I definitely felt that the enemies dodge my attacks way more when I use Spidey lead with Ant-man and Wasp, than they do when I use a Venom lead with Gamora and Giant-man. (The Bug Bites team bonus & Spidey's leadership brings his dodge up to about 60%)

I also felt the same way when I was doing Ronan's 5th mission. It would make sense to have enemies dodge similarly as you, as it would level the playing field a little bit.

* Energy attack: 3/4* Lv40 UVision (Ultron'sHatred) - 3429
* Physical def: 5/5* Lv45 Spidey (Animal Instinct) - 3034
* Energy def: 3/4* Lv40 UVision (Ultron'sHatred) - 2492
* HP: 5/5* Lv40 Venom (Bloodthirst) - 8815

(Spidey and Venom are with 4/4* Iron Patriot's +20% phy attack boost along with their team bonus, and UVision is with 4/4* Ronan's 24% attack and def boost.)

I was pretty surprised at how Spidey had the highest def in my roster, because people had said he is squishy. But he was my first 5*, and is definitely my most heavily invested character, so it makes sense.

non_PTSD,"So I'd like to get a dedicated thread about your thoughts or what you notice about the new update. 

Here's mine:

* The extra gear can be useful for min-maxing your favorite characters
Ex: I maxed my Venom's crit rate and equipped a critical rate booster from Black Panther's dimension rift, and he now has a whopping 44.5% crit rate when paired with Spidey. With Spidey &amp; DD, 49.37%. Crazy!

* The big damage numbers are a bit intrusive, but it's not terrible.

",imjms737
non_PTSD,"So when I combine an ISO8 I already have equipped, can the attack/defense type change?

That would suck...",imjms737
non_PTSD,"I am a huge fan of Venom both in and outside of the game, so I have been running Spidey & Venom led by War Machine as my A team.

I finally got enough strength born stones to bring my rank 4 venom to fully mastery, but it just doesn't seem worth it.
The stats upgrade I get when taking him from 3/4* to 4/4* are...

* Physical def: 1841 -> 1894
* Energy def: 1399 -> 1446

...and that's it.
Really? I love Venom, so I want to max him out, but is the above really worth spending 120 norm stones (aka 720 energy) for?

Is this a bug? Or does his 4th mastery really suck this much?",imjms737
non_PTSD,"So I ran an experiment to figure out which is better for Spidey & Venom: WM's leadership or the team bonuses you get from DD .

<Experiment method>

* I went through Ronan's lv 4 stage 17 times with WM leading Spidey and Venom, and then 17 times with DD leading Spidey and Venom. I then recorded how long it took for me to clear each level, as measured in the final victory screen. 
* I only used Venom throughout all of my 34 runs

**Result: War Machine's physical boost leadership gives better results for Spidey & Venom if you mainly use Venom.**

*[Character stats, times & results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jyvUyh7rw8IbBuG7t9_fV7bLX9mhDpBfy53Ergul2FE/edit?usp=sharing)*

Confounding variables:

* WM is fully mastered rank 3; DD is fully mastered rank 2. If DD was fully mastered 3 rank, the results may have been different.
* WM is level 39, DD is level 34 (Leveled up to 34 during run #6)
* Since I only used Venom, who has a 7.66% dodge compared to Spider-Man's 15.34% (with the team bonuses from DD), DD's leadership did not activate as frequently as it would have if I had used only Spidey, which could have led to a different result.
* If DD had been fully mastered rank 4 and lvl 40, his attacks as a striker for Venom could have tipped the results to DD-team's favor (not sure).

Thoughts:

* I love Venom both in and out of the game, so my focus was whether DD or WM benefits Venom's gameplay. If you like Spider-Man more, you may be better off with DD. (not sure)
* I think DD is an awesome character, but I personally like the diversity of having one of each type in the WM & Spidey & Venom team.",imjms737
non_PTSD,"After reading a couple posts here that mentioned that developers had a specific character play style in mind when designing the characters (which I agree with), I decided to try to bring out the maximum potential of the character, instead of making an average all-around character.

For example, I had my fully mastered 4star Spidey's 3rd gear all on HP boosts, but I now have 2/4 boosting his dodge (the first is HP % level, and the last boost is HP), as well as the Animal Instinct ISO-set, which gives him an additional 3.3% dodge. Combined with his 4% dodge boost leadership, he can dodge a considerable amount of attacks, which makes up for the trade-off in his HP points.

* My dataset is very small (n=35, from 7am to 12am the next day), so making conclusions based only on my data is hasty

* I am in Tokyo, which is in the same time zone as South Korea, which is where Netmarble is from

**Findings**

* P(Consumable) = 80%
* P(Biometrics) = 14.29%
* P(Team Package) = 5.71%
* I got biometrics/team packages often in the morning (8:00-9:30) and at night (21:30-22:30) in Japan time (GMT +9)
* If you are waiting for a specific hero's biometric to show, the  probability is: 1/45 heroes X 14.29% = 0.00317 
*But this is almost meaningless, as there may be different rates for each hero, not to mention some heroes have more than one possible bio (ex: Venom has x10, x20, x40, and x100) and the rates for each probably differ*

non_PTSD,"This is a long story with a lot of details. So strap in, there's a nice payoff at the end. 

Like most TIFU, I was younger at the time, about 19 years old and was working at an Italian restaurant in the town that I live in. I live in a decently sized beach town that has no little to no crime and feels very much like a small town. 

The bosses at the restaurant I worked at were only a few years older than me and had hired me basically because I made them laugh during the interview. I realized this was important on my first day, because basically every other employee at the restaurant were girls. Hot ones. Like it's hard to concentrate on what you were doing hot. Of course my bosses did this so that they could hook up with them after work. And it worked. I regularly witnessed this process. So it was never surprising when one wouldn't show up and they'd hire another hot one sometime thereafter. I actually became numb to it. Instead of trying to act cool when a hot girl showed up for her first day, I was actually just cool about it. Because I was never the one getting laid. The bosses monopolized every chance that walked in through the front door. 

So when one day, a mid 30's supermodel faced Russian girl walked in the front door dressed like me, I didn't even flinch. She was without a doubt, the new hottest girl at the restaurant. But I was polite and said hi a couple times to her, but ultimately ignored her the first few weeks she worked with me. Mind you, the restaurant was always super busy and I knew that all these girls ended up hooking up with my wealthy, good looking bosses. I knew my chances were slim to none. Why bother even trying? 

After a few weeks of basically ignoring this girl, I realize that every day we work together, she basically starts to follow me around. If I'm at the bar, she's at the bar. If I'm at a break out back, she's on her break too. We start talking, and she's funny and I like listening to her. So eventually I start giving her rides home from work and picking her up when she needs it. And thus begins the framework for the most insane hookup night of my life. 

See, this girl didn't own her own car, but lived in a nice house with a roommate in a nice neighborhood. The same neighborhood as my wealthy bosses. My bosses actually had to pass her house on their way home from work. The neighborhood was within walking distance of work, which is why she started working there. So we start getting closer, but like the idiot that I am, I never even begin to think there is potential that I could hook up with her. I'm sure I am completely in the friend zone. And I didn't care. She's pretty and she's hanging around with me and I'm 19. She's 30 something. I feel special enough. 

I also don't think much of it either when I show up to work and start getting ribbed by one of my bosses about hanging out with her. He teased me in a fun way and I deny there being anything between us because there wasn't. But after a few days of this, I noticed the boss who primarily hooks up with the girls watching me a lot and not being so nice to me anymore. I'm young, but I immediately understand the problem I'm creating. He hires hot girls and then fucks them. That's the routine. I'm fucking up his routine. Hottest girl in the restaurant is hanging around me and not him. Being that I like my job, and make way more money than a 19 year old should, I really start pushing away from hot Russian girl. To the point of ignoring her. This was when I learned an early lesson about really hot girls. One you've probably heard before. Their entire adult life is riddled with guys who chase them, constantly pester them and never leave them alone. For a guy, any guy, to completely ignore them, is foreign to them. Paying them no attention will a lot of time actually make them go after you harder. Which is exactly what happened. 

So now it's becoming noticeable to me and everyone else we work with that this girl won't leave me alone. She begins to hang on me and tease me and do anything that will have me paying attention to her. On one side of the coin, it was awesome. On the other side, I could see my one bosses boiling rage that the younger funny guy he hired was beating him in the hot Russian girl game. And I wasn't just beating him, I was sweeping the series. Without so much as trying. 

So one weekend night I show up for work and as soon as I get inside, the boss who has begun to hate me calls me into the office. By the way, let's call hot, supermodel Russian girl ""Anna"". 

Boss: ""What's going on with Anna?""
Me: ""I don't know, did she not show up?""
Boss: ""No, I mean with you and her. You guys fucking?""

So I'm young and smart, and know when I shouldn't let people walk over me or intimidate me. I want to keep my job, but I won't be a bitch about things either. So smiling I say, ""I'm not sure if that's any of your business.""

Big mistake. The mistake that starts it all. Because he slams the paper's he working on down hard on the table. He turns around in his chair and says, ""Do you like your job? Do you want to keep it?"" He knows the answer, so I just stare at him. ""Well then stop seeing Anna. Stop picking her up, stop hanging with her every second that you are here. Stop allowing her to hang on you. Or I'll fire you."" Immediately I understand the depth of how much he is into this girl and he's willing to fire me over it to get his way. And so I agree. I make the decision right then and there, that I'll keep away from her. Like I said, I have little to no chance anyway, and I'm making great money. Whatever. 

The night begins to wind down and I decide to go take a break out back. I've been ignoring Anna all night and my boss is now thoroughly pleased with me. His master scheme has worked and he can get back to trying to fuck the hottest waitress in the restaurant. So I'm sitting out back, not even thinking about the situation when Anna busts out the back door and slams it shut behind her. She's evidently pissed. She walks right up to me and doesn't fuck around with what's on her mind. 

Anna: ""Are you mad at me?""

Me: ""No, look Anna, I like you. You're great. But us being friends is making shit uncomfortable with the bosses and I. They're getting pissed at me.""

Anna: ""Because (shitty boss) wants to fuck me?""

Me: Yes, because (shitty boss) wants to fuck you.""

Anna: ""Do you want to fuck me?""

This is the part in the movie where the record would scratch, and then the main character laughs uncomfortably, completely at a loss for words. 

Me: ""Um, uh... look, you're beautiful. No guy who sees you isn't attracted to you.""

Anna: ""I asked if you wanted to fuck me?""

Me: ""Yeah. I would fuck you."" 

Anna: ""Good, then when we got off work tonight, take me back to my place and fuck me."" 

And with that she walks off and back into the restaurant. I sit there stunned, in a haze. I'm pretty sure she's serious. I'm terrified. My life up until this point has been awful drunken hookups with high school girls at parties. I literally can't think. But I'm in. I'm solidly fucking in. Fuck my boss. This is worth losing my job over. 

So we wrap up work and she jumps in my car and we speed off. It's only when I pull up to her house, do I remember, shit... my boss lives in this neighborhood. I'm pretty sure he has to pass right down this road when he goes home. This must be how he has figured out she and I had been hanging out so much. I can't leave my car in the driveway. He'll see it. So she comes up with an idea I can't disagree with. There's a doctors office in a business complex right across the street. I can park there and just run back over. It's perfect. 

So I get back to her house, and walk in her front door and walk to her room, and she's standing in her underwear. It goes without saying that it's a memory burned into my mind. She takes my hand, sits me down on her bed and what follows is exactly what a 19 year old kid dreams of. So it's about 30 minutes later and the room is darkly lit and I'm praying to every major deity and thanking them that I haven't finished too quickly, because I want this moment to last forever. She's on top of me, and time is in slow motion. It's the greatest moment of my life at that point. Which is why it took me a few seconds to realize I'm seeing flashlights on her ceiling. I'm also seeing flashlights underneath her door to her room. She notices them first. Then I'm snapped back to reality. She starts to freak out. It's obviously flashlights. Pouring into her house. 

Being that I was the guy, and the guy is always supposed to protect the girl, I run naked to one of the windows. I look outside to see (and I'm not exaggerating here) 10 to 12 police cars with their lights on. In my peripheral I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. Slowly approaching is 5 officers dressed completely in SWAT gear. My only rational thought is that I'm watching all this and I'm naked. I no longer have an erection. I grab my boxers, throw them on and go to run back to the window. They're at this house, but this can't be for us. I'm confused. 

From outside, a man yells, ""(Town I live in) Police! Open the front door immediately! The house is surrounded! We have a K-9 Unit! We will send him in if you don't comply!"" I don't even think. I'm not a guy who gets in trouble a lot and have police officers in my family. The police tells you to do something, you do it. End of discussion. So I run to the front door, I swing it open and am staring at about 20 officers. SWAT included. Now my erection is inside me. I put my hands up, and go to speak when a hand comes out of nowhere and whips me to the ground. In my underwear. And it's raining. I land in a puddle. Hard. I hear hot Russian girl scream. The police rush past and enter the house. What the fuck is happening? I now have a vagina. 

I'm cuffed, there's dog's barking. A knee crushes into my neck and I'm throw into the back of a car while I'm asking what is happening. A few minutes pass and I turn to see hot Russian girl's roommate and hot Russian girl in my t-shirt and a towel talking to police. They're both cuffed. I'm sitting the back of the squad car for about a minute when I glance across the street and see 3 more police cars parked next to my Jeep. Where I had parked in the business complex. That perfect parking spot to hide from my boss. Then it dawns on me. It wasn't a perfect spot. Because it was well passed midnight. We work at a restaurant that doesn't get out till late. So I parked my car in an empty business parking lot, late at night, got out and ran around the side of the building. Mind you, I'm dressed in black from my job. Late at night, dressed in black, running around the side of a closed building. That probably looked pretty suspicious to the elderly security guard who patrolled the complex at night. 

So he made a call to the sheriff. So I know you're thinking at this point, well there's no way this many officers, let alone SWAT would show up for this. But they did. And here's why. The security guard went to the building to play police officer while waiting for the cops to arrive. He got out his flashlight and went searching apparently from building to building looking into windows. He at one point climbed up on a bench and looked inside a window and slipped and his flashlight crashed into and through a window. So now the alarms have gone off. When the police finally show up, he completely neglects to mention, he's the one who set off the alarm. Being that he's old, I've kind of forgiven him since then. So when the cops go searching the buildings they not only find a broken window, but know someone has attempted to get inside. Obviously. But they can't find me. Because I'm across the street having the greatest night of my life. So they call the K-9 Unit for a search. Which just so happens to be doing a late night training operation with the local SWAT team. What better way to train, then to do a real world exercise with someone breaking and entering. 

But it gets better. Her roommate drove a really nice car. An older Mercedes. A Mercedes that had just recently been in a minor car accident the week before. Damage right to the driver side of her car. Not major, but a nice little dent. So when the K-9 sniffs and tracks me passed the building, right up to the house I'm in, (yeah the dogs noses are that good) they now see a car that looks like it has been kicked in and house with basically no lights on in it. They treat the situation as if I could be running and trying to get away from them. Which gets us back to where I'm at. Soaked, in my underwear, in the back of a squad car. 

Now I know this has been a long story, and if you've stuck with it, the payoff is coming right now. And it's an amazing payoff. 

When I'm pulled out of the car, I explain the same story to them that hot Russian girl has told them: my boss told me to stay away and so I parked my car across the street to get laid. Basically word for word. The look they all give each other was priceless. I'll cherish that look forever. But, they now realize they have fucked up majorly but don't want to admit it just yet. There's about 10 cops standing around me outside of the car. 

SWAT guy: ""How'd the window get broken?""

Me: ""I don't know, I didn't touch anything. I just ran around the side to her house.""

Officer: ""The security guard just told us he accidentally broke it, he didn't tell us that earlier.""

SWAT guy: ""So you're over here, kinda hooking up?""

Me: ""Yes sir. We work together. We just got off work. That's why I just parked there.""

SWAT guy #2: ""She's like in her 30's. You look about 16.""

Me: ""I'm 19. But yeah, she's older than me.""

SWAT guy: ""Wow."" 

A couple chuckles. Then silence. 

SWAT guy: ""Seriously... good for you man. I'm amazed. You're on another level then I was at your age."" 

They then begin to apologize and begin to say things like ""You understand we were just doing our jobs, we didn't know what was actually happening. You could have been dangerous"" etc. etc. 

So I tell them not to worry and that I have police family members and completely understand. I won't be suing them or filing reports or anything. I just want the cuffs off. So they continue to be extra nice as they turn me around to take my cuffs off. So the payoff I've been talking about... the amazing kicker to the whole story. When they turn me around, I'm now facing back out across the street, in my underwear with the cuffs still on, and I see both my bosses pulled over on the side of the road, sitting on the side of their car, watching the whole thing. How long they have been there, I don't know. There were so many cop cars in the street they had to stop and wait. 

I was fired coincidentally within a few weeks. ",Redditscott

non_PTSD,"Hi all, 

I'm a sufferer of chronic pain, although I think my pain is less severe than what some of you seem to be going through. I want to make a video about pain and how it works. I've written a script and I would like it if you guys helped me to review the script. Is the information accurate? Is it worded in the most concise way possible? In what other ways can this script be improved? Ideally I'm looking to make the script shorter, not longer! 




Ok so here's the script:


Pain is a much more complex and fascinating topic than most people would assume. Pain seems to exist to help us to be aware of damage to our bodies and make sure we take appropriate action to promote healing. But the pain system, as it turns out, is really quite inaccurate! It is quite common to experience pain when there is no damage to the body at all, and conversely it is common to experience no pain when there is severe tissue damage! 
I’ve suffered from chronic pain for most of my adult life and over the last year or so I’ve learned some eye-opening things about pain. It is no exaggeration to say that the knowledge I acquired has changed my life completely, in a most positive way.  
Brief history of myself: Pain in my wrists started when I was 17. Over the years I got more and more pain with more and more activities. Ten years later all activities hurt and I was avoiding doing most things, because I feared there was some serious damage in my joints. However, doctors had never been able to find any clear problems. I just assumed my problem was something that medical science hadn't quite figured out yet. 
Through a most fortunate series of events I ended up in a pain program at a rehabilitation clinic. I learned a lot about pain and I want to clear up some misconceptions about pain! 

Misconception 1: Pain is an indication of tissue damage, and if it’s not, it’s a psychological problem. [The old ‘it’s between your ears’ adage]
Pain is an experience that is generated by or in the brain, whether there is tissue damage or not. The brain takes into account many factors when it gives of a pain signal. The relation between pain and tissue damage can be surprisingly weak. One simple rhyme to summarize this: no brain, no pain! 

Misconception 2: We have special pain receptors, pain nerves or pain pathways that are the cause of pain. 
We DO have neurons that measure things like pressure, chemicals, or temperature. When these exceed certain thresholds a danger signal is sent to the brain. These signals are called nociception, but they are not our ‘pain pathways’. Nociception is neither sufficient nor necessary for the experience of pain. Nociception occurs almost constantly in the body, yet only sometimes it results in the experience of pain. Pain can also occur without nociception. 
In one study normal subjects were connected to a stimulator and were told that a headache could occur as a result of the electrical current they would receive. Half of the subjects reported pain. The stimulator was in fact fake and did not deliver any current! 
Nociception is really just one of many variables the brain takes into account when it decides to generate a pain signal. 
Especially when pain lasts longer than about three months the relation between tissue damage and pain get more and more arbitrary. With longer-lasting pain a process called sensitization will start, whereby the whole nervous system becomes more sensitized to feeling pain in the affected region. 

Misconception 3: The pain you experience is just what it is, and there’s not much you can do about it, except taking painkillers. 
This is perhaps the most interesting thing of all. Your pain is not fixed, but you can make lasting changes to your brain and nervous system by your attitude towards your pain, your beliefs about the pain and how much you move. 
In one study subjects with chronic arm pain were asked to imagine doing a painful task. NOT actually doing it, just imagining it! Not only did their pain increase after this imagination task, but also the actual swelling in the arms increased by an average of 8 percent! 
Anything that increases the brain’s perception of the need to protect you can increase your pain. This means if you believe your chronic pain is an indication of harm to your body your brain will start protecting you more and more by playing ‘the pain tune’ sooner and sooner. If, however you understand the biology of pain and start to let go of the fear of pain, your nervous system will learn to relax again and the pain levels can go down! 

Pain is a complex issue and I had to simplify some things. More details can be found in the excellent book ‘Explain Pain’, by David Butler. If you have experiences with chronic pain yourself I’d love to hear from you. Leave a comment or send me a message.

non_PTSD,"My tips are

1. Goals. Set clear and specific goals for yourself. Don't set the bar too high or you're setting yourself up for failure. 

2. Pegging. 'Attach' your new habit to an existing habit, so it's easier to remember. 

3. Tracking. Keep track of how you are doing with an app like Habitbull. 

4. Reviewing. Make an appointment with yourself in your calendar to review your progress. 

5. Kindness. Be kind to yourself because habit building is hard and failing is part of the process!

non_PTSD,"Last week I went for a walk in the forest. The next day, when I was in bed, my legs started itching. I turned on the light and discovered two tiny little fucking disgusting ticks just chilling there, trying to deprive me of blood that I would prefer to keep myself. I felt a bit panicky, because of Lyme disease. To prevent getting this disease it is important to removes the ticks ASAP, preferably within twenty-four hours. My walk was twenty-six hours ago. I removed the ticks and proceeded to check the rest of my body for ticks. I got a bit paranoid and started to feel an itch in my butt crack. I discovered it is very hard to examine your own butt crack. (LPT: put mirror on laundry basket, squat over it, shine with torch in the area of darkness…) I then saw a black blob about 2 mm in diameter next to my b-hole. Shit, a tick that sucked itself full of blood in an area that I couldn’t quite reach. I proceeded to panic, because I wanted this fucker out of my body. Even though I felt embarrassed to the max, I decided it was essential to wake up my mum so she could help me. An awkward wake-up session later and my grumpy mum is bending over my ass to remove from there: a piece of dried-up poo. 

TL; DR my mom discovered I don’t wipe properly. 

Edit: Peeps are saying it's nonsense that I can't reach my ass. True, I can reach but not with the precision needed to take out a tick. It has to be done in a certain way, so the head is not left behind...

Edit2: Thanks for all the butt wiping tips. Also it seems removing the head matters less then I thought. TIL",thepillow86

non_PTSD,"So, I've been missing my leg for four years now. I've adapted quite well. I get around just fine with a prosthetic.

However, when I'm at home in my small apartment, I prefer to crawl short distances instead of going through the hassle of putting my prosthetic on. It's jut more convenient that way.

So last night we had some company over to watch scary movies, and I read everyone a few short submissions to /r/nosleep. Everyone was pretty spooked before we went to bed. Two friends of mine slept on the couch, and one of them was someone we have never had over before. So this individual had never seen me crawl without my leg on. To describe it, I kind of move like a very slow cheetah who's missing a hind leg. Like a tri-pod crawl, if that makes sense. So, I suppose it can be unsettling if you're not expecting it. 

In the middle of the night/early morning, I decide to leave my room for a drink. I didn't turn the hall light on so I wouldn't disturb my sleeping guests. There's just enough light coming from the light above the sink to guide me where I needed to go. As I'm turning the corner to enter the kitchen, I see a figure and I hear ""OH SHIT WHAT THE FUCK"", next thing I know, I'm getting kicked in the face. 
I suppose my friend recognized my foul mouth screaming back at him, because then he turned the light on and started apologizing profusely. 

TL;DR: I crawled through my apartment without my prosthetic leg, my friend thought I was a demon and started kicking me in the face.  


EDIT: A lot of people are asking why I don't just hop. Well, in the accident that took my leg, I also maintained compound fractures in all the long bones in my remaining leg, causing the my femur, tibia, and fibula too all be replaced by titanium rods. Hopping on such a leg causes too much stress and pain to my remaining knee cap. 
Even without those injuries though, it's usually not recommended for any amputee to hop as a frequent mode of transport, even for short distances. ",rooftop152
non_PTSD,"Hey there

I have a pure bred Border Collie named Loki. He will be a year on November 25th. 

He is brilliant and very well behaved. He is the best trained dog I have ever raised/trained myself. He is the pride and joy of my life. 

Unfortunately, though, Loki is a very nervous and anxious dog. He is very untrusting, anxious, and nervous dog when he is around new people, too many people, or people he hasn't come to like yet.
Especially men. Loki hates men. He even dislikes women with long hair. In total, there are maybe four people Loki really likes, 20-30 people he tolerates, afraid of mostly everyone else, and maybe 2-3 people he just hates. 
Loki also barks at everything whenever we take him on walks. He barks at any man that walks in my house. He avoids even walking near most people. Aside from the five people he's really fond of, he can behave very defensively towards everyone else. 
Does anyone have any tips for getting him more comfortable and less aggressive towards people? He's never bitten anyone, in fact even if he's barking at someone, he will backs away from anyone that approaches him and is obviously afraid. But He's not exactly friendly. 

I hope I didn't manage to offend the internet in some way and inspired hateful comments with this post. I love my dog with all my heart, and I just wanna make his life as comfortable as I am capable of. Thanks for any help!",rooftop152

&nbsp;

The same week, he buys his first motorcycle. He asks the seller for any tips to maintain the motorcycle and is told ""When it rains, put a thin layer of Vaseline on the outside of the bike - that'll help prevent it from rusting"", and he's handed a small tub of Vaseline which he puts in his pocket.

&nbsp;

On Friday, he and his girlfriend head to her parents' place on his new motorcycle. Before getting inside, she says ""By the way, my family has a weird tradition but it's an important one - whoever is the first to talk during dinner has to wash all of the dishes. It'll impress my Dad if you don't talk first.""


&nbsp;

They all sit down for dinner. Mother, father, guy, girlfriend, and girlfriend's sister. It's a massive dinner with a ton of dishes. No one says a word. Guy feels his girlfriend sliding her hand up his leg... so he reciprocates. He begins feeling her up, eventually fondling her breasts. The father looks on, horrified, but still says nothing. Guy reaches over and begins fondling girlfriend's sister's breasts with his free hand; the father looks on, red with anger, but still says nothing. Guy stands up, lays the mother on the table, and starts shagging her six ways from Sunday. Certain that this would drive the father into a rage, he locks eyes with him. Still, not a word. Just then, guy hears the sound of rain hitting the kitchen window and remembers his motorcycle is outside, so he reflexively reaches into his pocket and pulls out the tub of Vaseline, at which point the father jumps up and shouts ""OH FINE, I'LL DO THE FUCKING DISHES!""",TheTrueMountainMan

Sure enough, the parrot is a delightful companion and they barely spend a second apart for the entire week.

&nbsp;

On Sunday morning, the old woman goes to church - but not wanting to be away from her parrot, brings him along by hiding him in her purse. Halfway through the priest's sermon, the parrot jumps out of her purse onto her shoulder and shouts ""HOLY FUCK IT'S COLD IN HERE!"". Horrified, she tries to cram him back into her purse - but he jumps out again, onto her shoulder, and again screams ""HOLY FUCK IT'S COLD IN HERE!"". The entire congregation sits in silent horror, staring at the old woman and the bird. She grabs her parrot and runs out of the church, embarrassed beyond belief.

&nbsp;

First thing on Monday morning, she returns to the pet store and says ""You have to take him back. He jumps out and screams obscenities in church!"" to which the store owner knowingly nods his head and says ""I was worried that might happen. Look, it will probably never happen again... but just in case, the next time he does it, just grab him by his feet, swing him around your head three times, and put him back on your shoulder. That's how he's been taught to know when he's saying something he shouldn't."" Hesitantly, she takes the parrot home again.

The week goes by perfectly pleasantly - the two of them are fast friends. On Sunday morning, she takes him with her to church.

non_PTSD,"Ok so two disclaimers: 1) as is usually the case, this didn't actually happen TODAY but very recently at the end of my girlfriend's Basic Training course, and 2) as she's still a bit too traumatized to post it on her own Reddit account, I'm having her explain as I transcribe on mine, so therefore the TIFU will be told from her perspective and some names and minor events will be fucked with to protect identities.

&nbsp;

Today I fucked up. Here's the deal: where I just finished doing basic training, there are four awards handed out at the end of course: top overall candidate, top marksman, top athlete, and comradeship. I know, I know - insert comments here about the wish-washy bullshit nature of modern basic training and all their pointless hand-holding feel-goodisms no doubt the result of the pussification of today's army. But that was the deal, 4 awards. The first 3 are decided by the chain of command of your specific course, and then the comradeship award is decided by popular vote amongst all of the recruits.

&nbsp;

So, some backstory on ... we'll call him Private ""Flump"". Private Flump was a sweaty, dumpy-looking 20-something-year old kid who somehow managed to pass the pre-screening exams despite being fairly strong on the ""herp derp"" side of things, in some truly mind-boggling ways. First of all - please note that we genuinely did our best to help him (almost) all the way through course. But I've got to tell it straight now; he was almost enigmatic - the things he would fuck-up were so simple, even by the fucked up standards of basic training. And it's one thing to be a fuck-up, it's another thing to be apathetic about it, and do nothing to fix it. Example: for our ""inspection lay-out"", we had to have three dress-shirts properly hung up in our closet - Private Flump somehow interpreted that to mean ""dangle three shirts unbuttoned and un-ironed in whatever fucking order you want"". The first time our instructor - we'll call him Sergeant Hate - inspected Private Flump, I heard the most creative string of insults I'd heard in a long time. 

&nbsp;

Sgt H: ""HOLY SANTA CLAUS SHIT, PRIVATE FLUMP. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN YOUR CLOSET? IS THIS ABSTRACT ART?"" 

&nbsp;

Pvt F: ""Uhhh, no Sergeant!"" 

&nbsp;

Sgt H: ""You fucking sure? Because right now your dress shirts are sticking out like a dick on a wedding cake."" 

&nbsp;

Pvt F: ""Uhhh, Sergeant?"" 

&nbsp;

Sgt H: ""You think they save spots in Valhalla for thick-skulled thunderfucks like you?"" 

&nbsp;

Pvt F: ""... No, Sergeant?"" 

&nbsp;

Sgt H: ""Holy fuck, are you asking me or telling me?"" 

&nbsp;

Pvt F: ""... Telling you, Sergeant?"" 

&nbsp;

Sgt H: ""You think I'm fucking you, Private Flump?"" 

&nbsp;

Pvt F: ""...No, Sergeant?"" 

&nbsp;

Sgt H: ""YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT I'M NOT. MY JOB ISN'T TO FUCK 
YOU, IT'S TO PUSH IT IN FURTHER WHEN YOU FUCK YOURSELF"" 

&nbsp;

-at which point he proceeded to rip all of Pvt Flump's belongings out of the closet and throw them in the garbage. And you can guess what happened the next day for inspection - more unbuttoned shirts dangling haphazardly in the closet. As Sgt H poured the water from Pvt Flump's canteen onto the ground and then used a shitty, unbuttoned, un-ironed dress shirt to mop it up, Pvt Flump's mouth dropped open in disbelief and Sgt H snapped back with ""CLOSE YOUR FUCKIN MOUTH, FATASS, THERE'S NO FLYING BACON AROUND HERE.""

&nbsp;

Private Flump also got ready in the mornings the same way old people fuck: slowly, and uncomfortably to watch. We pretty much received belt-fed bullshit for Private Flump on a daily basis. He'd walk around the building with the ribbon on his beret hanging out, he’d pack 1/10th the gear for PT in his kit bag (which might I add, got us all in an astronomical amount of shit), he'd somehow forget to do up a single button on his shirt, his boots - which were supposed to be blackened - would come out looking like a dog fucked a leather couch. I sometimes wondered if Private Flump suffered from some underlying mental deficiency for the way he fucking sucked at everything military or if he really just didn’t give two shits about the clusterfuckery of insults and berating he received from our staff on an hourly basis.

&nbsp;

Now, just like Private Pyle, no one particularly minded Private Flump's dump-flumpiness until it started to fuck the rest of our days up. His dog-fuckery resulted in us ""holding up the building"" by doing wall-squats for cumulated totals of hundreds of hours and enough flutter-kicks to power the windmill energy requirement for a small village in Holland. At one point, Sgt Hate was so sick of us basically preparing Flump's entire room for inspection that he told Flump to move all his shit to the other side of barracks - away from us - and told us that if we ""lifted one fucking finger to help him, he would Peter Pan his way across the fucking building and punch a hole in our souls"". We watched as Pvt Flump moved his shit, one item at a time, down the hallway and even if we'd wanted to - we couldn't help him. I could fill another ten paragraphs with the stupid shit Private Flump did but I'll get to the fuck up. At the end of course, I felt fucked-around by my course staff enough that I didn't give a shit about the comradeship award. As a joke, I voted for Private Flump. That, my friends, was a huge mistake.

&nbsp;

We voted while we were out in the field, so all of us wrote our votee’s name down on a slip of paper and the staff took them into their shack to count them up. As we're all standing in the camp waiting for the results, suddenly one of our Sergeants, a foul-mouthed sailor who constantly looked like he wanted to fuck all of us ten ways from Sunday with a dick wrapped in coarse grit sandpaper bursts out of the shack. ""AAAAALRIGHT. I WANNA KNOW WHICH OF YOU FUCKIN’ HAMS VOTED FOR FUCKIN’ FLUMP” and immediately my stomach sank. I didn't say a word. No one did; the other forty recruits just looked at each other, stupefied, trying to figure out if he was joking. ""NO ONE, HEY?? DON'T FUCK ME OFF, YOU CRAYON-EATERS. IT'S CALL OF DUTY AND SHIRLEY TEMPLE NIGHT."" No response. I am still trying to figure out the severity of the situation, when Sgt P lost all patience. ""EVERYONE GET IN THE FUCKING SQUAT POSITION NOW- AND GET READY TO STAY THERE UNTIL ONE OF YOUR COLOSSAL UNDERWEAR-EATING THUDFUCKS REMEMBERS YOU WROTE FLUMP'S NAME DOWN."" We all immediately grab our air chairs, rifles held out in front of us, but I don't want to blade my other course mates so I immediately put up my hand and say ""SERGEANT!"". Up until then, I'd been the quiet, studious girl who had been known as a complete an abject square, goody-goody type. 

&nbsp;

Sgt P strolled up to me and growled ""... What the fuck do YOU want?"". 

&nbsp;

""It was me, Sergeant"" I declared. 

&nbsp;

""...You?"" he said, sounding completely incredulous. 

&nbsp;

""Yes, Sergeant"" I said. He studied me for a while, as my arms are starting to waver. I was waiting for him to lose his fucking mind and jack me up, but instead he said ""...No you didn’t. You wouldn’t do that. No fuckin’ way. ALRIGHT YOU FUCKIN HAMS, OWN UP! WHO THE FUCK WAS IT?!"" 

&nbsp;

What?!?! I was in shock – I’d just tried to own up to it, and my fellow recruits were getting MAD. I was hearing shouts of ""WHOEVER THE FUCK WROTE IT DOWN, JUST OWN UP TO IT!"". I put up my hand again – Sergeant H came over. 

&nbsp;

""Sergeant, it was me, I voted for Private Flump"". 

&nbsp;

Sgt H stared at me again and said ""... Nope. Bullshit. You're just taking the fall for whoever the fuck did this"" at which point he returned to the shack and came back out with a memorandum completed by Private Flump and started studying the hand-writing. 

&nbsp;

""PRIVATE FLUMP DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE FUCKING EXERCISE AND JUST VOTED FOR YOUR FUCKING SELF?” 

&nbsp;

Private Flump looked HORRIFIED. ""N... No, Sergeant!” to which Sgt H said ""I'll give you one more chance to own up to it. IS YOUR BRAIN POWERED BY STUPIDITY OR DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME KIND OF SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTS TO BE THIS FUCKING THICK?! DID YOU FUCKING VOTE FOR YOURSELF?! EVERYONE KEEP YOUR FUCKING ARMS UP!"", and at this point he's leaning over Private Flump. 

&nbsp;

""No, I didn't, Sergeant, I swear!"" 

&nbsp;

Private Flump then looked like a lightbulb had gone off in his brain- if he owned up to voting for himself, the pain might stop. It was like watching the rolodex of a binary system winding down as he realized that his chosing of ""0"" had been ineffective so the only option left was to confusedly try ""1"". I raised my hand again but the Sergeant dismissed me and continued staring at Private Flump. Everyone is sweating and suffering now. ""PRIVATE FLUMP, DO NOT STOP SQUATS TO ANSWER ME. YOU'RE JUST STICKING YOUR ASS OUT AND THIS ISN'T THAT KIND OF PARTY. DID YOU FUCKING VOTE FOR YOURSELF?"" to which a very sweaty, upset, and confused but vaguely hopeful Pvt Flump said timidly, ""... Y ... Yes Sergeant?!""

&nbsp;

”ALL BUT FLUMP, RECOVER!"" - so we stood up, and were quickly sent off, and the last time I saw Private Flump, he was doing burpees with a strangely satisfied-looking Sgt H standing above him like a giant man teaching a big scared baby how to walk for the first time.

&nbsp;

Dear staff and fellow course mates: It was me. Sorry about that.

&nbsp;

non_PTSD,"Disclaimer: ok, admittedly this happened a couple of years ago but I've never brought it to public light like I am here. It's a long read, and God, I wish this story wasn't true... but it is.

&nbsp;

Since I'm almost certain the girl in question is a Redditor, I'll be changing some names to keep things as anonymous as possible as this was humiliating enough the first time around.

&nbsp;

Some back story. I met this girl when I was taking a few summer courses to complete my remaining credits for my Bachelors degree (oh how ironic that name is). I was drawn to her right away because she has an exotic, Slavic-sounding name - for the sake of anonymity we'll call her Svetlana. She was radiant. She was beautiful, silent, and distant - like the Northern Lights. And like most people who aren't used to seeing the Northern Lights, I'd often catch myself just staring at her like an idiot, lost in thought. I guess the only difference is that the Northern Lights don't get weirded-out when you stare at them for extended periods with your mouth hanging open like a lobotomy patient, so that was one of my first mistakes.

&nbsp;

Anyways. I'd said nary a word to Svetlana but wanted to find a way to get to know her outside of class, where it was a bit less unwieldy to start up a conversation (versus ""HEY, TECTONIC SHIFT IS PRETTY SWEET, HEY? DO YOU LIKE THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS?""). So, I had a streak of genius (or so I thought) - I would invite my entire class (which was pretty small, maybe 20 people) to go to the movies, with the hopes that she would go too. And it worked. She signed up on the Facebook group I'd created for the event (I know, I'm practically Rico Suave when it comes to putting on the moves). It was settled. She and I - and about 10 people from our class - were going to see a horror movie on Saturday. Perfect.

&nbsp;

**Fuck up #1**: We get to the movies. Everyone's dancing awkwardly around the ""oh hey, now we're outside of class and we're being forced to interact at a non-academic level"" situation, myself included. We sit down in the seats near the back of the theatre and I make sure I sit right beside Svetlana. I wasn't planning on anything particularly nefarious, but I figured it'd be a fun way to break the ice if I waited for a scary part and then grabbed her knee to scare the bejeezes out of her, which I imagined would produce a hilarious shriek followed by startled laughter and then long talks about our future life together as husband and wife. So there I sat - hand poised inconspicuously to my side, ready to pounce. Cue fuck up #1. The scary part happened when a side character got bit by a monster, and it startled me so badly that I tensed up and **PUNCHED HER IN THE FUCKING LEG**. REALLY FUCKING HARD. Like, hard enough that she crumpled forward and almost hit her head on the seat in front of her. GREAT ICE BREAKER PAL, SHOW HER YOU'RE UNPREDICTABLY VIOLENT, PARTICULARLY WHEN STARTLED. I apologized profusely and Svetlana assured me she was ok, but I knew I'd given her a Macho Man Randy Savage charlie-horse and felt especially derpy. I spent the rest of the movie wishing I was dead.

&nbsp;

**Fuck up #2**: We left the movies. Standing outside, this same group of classmates - who didn't really know eachother any better after having sat silently through a horror movie - danced awkwardly around the ""how do I say goodbye to a group of people I don't really know"" situation, myself included. Svetlana said she'd be taking a bus home - and it turns out I was taking the same bus. We hadn't really talked since I smashed her leg like the fucking Hulk, so I figured this could be a chance for me to try to smooth things over. We both get on the bus and I try to sit beside her as casually as possible, and say something pretty stupid and vacuous like ""Hey, so that scary movie was scary, hey?"", but she entertained my stupid and vacuous question and we actually ended up having a really nice talk. She was into music, I was into music, she liked hiking, I liked hiking, that sort of thing. We got to her stop and I said ""This is actually only a few blocks from my place, do you want me to walk you home?"" - nervous that I might be imposing too much - but she responded with ""Wow, really? No one has ever asked to walk me home before, that's so sweet!"" - NAILED IT! I STILL HAVE A CHANCE OF SALVAGING THIS. Cue fuck up #2. So I walk her to her house, and the whole way we're talking about life, passion, the universe at large. We get to her house and the night is perfect - it's quiet, warm, a gentle summer breeze through the oak trees, soft glow from distant street lights. She says ""Well, this is my place..."", and we stand there looking at each other. She is rocking back and forth from her heels to her toes, looking at me, almost expectantly. And then she moves in a bit closer, and starts to lean forward... and I shake her hand. I shake her fucking hand, ladies and gentleman. Her eyes opened and her face contorted ever so slightly into a scowl of disgust, and I say ""Boy I had a great night Svetlana!"" or something equally stupid, and I turn around and literally run away. Like I said - Rico Suave, folks. I spent the rest of the run home wishing I was dead.

&nbsp;

**Fuck up #3 - the big one**: Our departure had been awkward enough (by my fault alone) that I basically couldn't bear to talk to Svetlana after that. About two weeks later, she posted in that same Facebook group (not a bad idea after all!) advertising that she'd be hosting a BBQ at her place in celebration of us finishing our course. ""PERFECT!"", I thought. ""I can prove once and for all that I'm not such a bumbling idiot!"". I was so nervous all day, my palms were sweaty, I couldn't eat anything. I put on my most stylish clothes and showed up trying to seem extra aloof and ""cool"". Boom, right away, social anxiety - the place was loaded with like 60 people, of whom I knew maybe 4 (including Svetlana). A few hours in, people started playing beer pong. ""PERFECT!"", I thought. I don't drink regularly, but I'd spent the past year playing ping pong every day (I'm *THAT cool*), so I knew the weight and flight trajectory dynamics of a ping pong ball and figured I could seize this opportunity to really impress her.

&nbsp;

""SVETLANA!"" I shouted. ""Let's play beer ping pong! Same team!"", to which she looked uncomfortable but eventually said ""It's just beer pong, not beer ping pong, but... sure, I guess"", and she walked over to the table with me. PERFECT. And just as I suspected - I single-handedly dominated the first game against 2 strangers, without losing a single cup. However, because I don't drink, I'd never played beer pong, and didn't know the rules. I thought the game was sort of perfunctory and the main purpose was to drink, so in a doubly-stupid move, I say ""Don't worry Svetlana, I've got this-"" and I down all 8 cups of booze. Turns out it wasn't beer - they were playing with shots of hard liquor. But hell I didn't care, I was riding a euphoric athlete's high from my demanding victory of throwing a ping pong ball across a table. ""Who else wants to get their ass kicked?!"" I shout at the room. Svetlana was starting to warm up a bit, and quietly chuckled. Two more people stepped up. In quick order, I'd dominated that game too, and only lost one cup. After the game, Svetlana saw me reaching for a cup and grabbed my arm but I said ""Don't worry Svetlana, I've got this-"" and downed all of my cups, again. I could hear people snickering and speaking under their breath but I ignored it. ""Come on, who else wants some of this?!"" I taunted, feeling ten feet tall and bullet proof. ""No no no, you should just sit down for a bit"" warned Svetlana. ""Oh HELL no, you and me are going right to the top!"" I said. ""Oh, I just think you should take a break for a b-"" ""WHO WANTS TO GET STOMPED?!"" I interrupted. Two more strangers stepped up. And I narrowly won the third game, not quite as smoothly or impressively, but I won. Before she could stop me, I'd downed all of our cups, again. She looked a bit amused, a bit concerned, but not as uncomfortable as she had 10 minutes ago. And then, right in the front center of my head, I started to feel warm fuzzies.

&nbsp;

""HIDE AND SEEK!"" someone shouted from across the Living Room. At this point, running on 24 cups (which must have equaled 12-16 full shots) of hard liquor on an empty stomach, Hide and Seek sounded like a GREAT idea! With 60 people! In a one-story house. Whatever! Someone flicks of the lights and we all start running around like crazy people. Svetlana and I met abruptly at the door to one of the rooms. We hear the dude who was ""it"" approaching, so we duck into the room - which was painfully bare, and we were bound to get caught. Svetlana grabs me by the sleeve and pulls me into a closet at the side of the room. And there we sat; with the full moon beaming through the window and through the shutters in the closet door, the soft hum of ""Bare Naked Ladies"" playing on the stereo in the living room, the gentle pitter-patter of foot steps and ambient giggling of the Hide-and-Seekers outside. It was perfect. She looked at me, I looked at her, she leaned forward, I leaned forward, and we kissed! It was perfect. It was a beautiful kiss. I leaned back, my heart a-flutter, and say ""Svetlana... I just want you to know, I think you're r-"" *BBLLYEEEUUUUUUGH* and I PUKE, I PUKE RIGHT INTO SVETLANA'S SLIGHTLY-OPEN MOUTH. I PUKE INTO HER FUCKING FACE AND INTO HER MOUTH. I puke SO HARD, in fact, that I almost pass-out face down into her laundry bin. When I brace myself to catch my balance, I look at her, and now I am tumbling down the metaphorical Water Well of complete unrecoverable intoxication, and I make the drunken observation ""Haaa, Svetlana, your shirt is wet."" And then I realize what I'd done. I realize it's my puke all over her shirt, and face, and closet. I basically knock the closet doors off their hinges and stumble into her room and scream ""SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE ME HOME RIGHT NOW!"". At least that's what I tried to scream. I got out ""SOMEONE NEEDS TO T-"" and then *BBBLYYYEEEARRRRGGHHUUUUUHHHHH*, I puke again, hard, all over Svetlana's fucking BED, QUILT, PILLOWS, AND NIGHT TABLE. THIS SHIT WAS COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH LIKE IT WAS A FIRE HOSE AND I WAS TRYING TO SAVE CITY HALL. And then... darkness. That's where my memory stops.

&nbsp;

I woke up the next day, face-down in my room, completely naked, with my door wide open. When I stumbled into the living room - feeling like someone had taken a shit inside my skull - I saw my clothes everywhere. My room mates later told me that someone had driven me home at about 3AM, and I was slamming on our front door with my shirt pulled over my head, shouting incoherently in basically only vowel sounds and Svetlana's name - ""AAHAOHHH, EEEYYAAHHOOHHEERRGGHH!! AAAARRAARRROORRYYYRRRRGH!! SVETLANNNAAAAA GGUUUURRGGGUUUHH"", and when they opened the door, I ripped all of my clothes off and hurled them around our house like the Tasmanian Devil. Pants were on the fridge, shirt was in the stove, socks were in the sink, one shoe was in the garbage and the other shoe was never accounted for.

&nbsp;

Svetlana, if you're reading this, I'm so sorry things never worked out. And for puking in your mouth... And punching you in the leg.

TL;DR - Tried to impress a girl I had a crush on, instead I turned into a psychotic puke-breathing dragon and barfed into her mouth.",TheTrueMountainMan
non_PTSD,"Today I fucked up. There's a girl in my Ecology class. Let's call her ""Madge"". Madge is your go-getting try-hard holier-than-thou know-it-all with an unchanging facial expression I can only describe as ""cat trying to shit a peach pit"". One of those constant-frowners, and constant-downers. 

I even tried to get along with Madge at the start; I'd sit by her and try to engage her (read: humor her) with conversations in relevant topics about Ecology, such as the thrilling handedness of apes or edge-of-your-seat songbird plumage complexity, but just trying to be civil was a futile endeavour. Expecting Madge to be civil with you because you were civil with her is like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn't eat it. Madge was born to be an asshole.

Everything you said to her was met with a ""Pffft"", or a dramatic roll of the eyes, and a quick retort such as ""Well, if you'd actually *read* Carter et al. 2007, you would have known that..."" She had to be better and smarter than everyone, at everything, all the time. And boy, that shit got real old, real quick. So I stopped sitting by her. And began to loathe her. With a pre-occupied disposition. I thought about her twice today before even writing this, that's how much I don't like her.

Fast forward to the first Capture the Flag game of the year. Being a Freshman, I thought I'd attend as a way to get out of my residence room and meet some people. The first game was at about 8:00PM, the campus was already dark, and I showed up just wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Out of 150+ people (who knew Capture the Flag was so popular?) I ended up being possibly the most under-dressed person there. Camouflage, Ghillie suits, face-paint, and black morph costumes were just some of the norm. This was like Capture the Flag Olympics. 

Teams were divided into short sleeve vs. long sleeve, and the ""flags"" were two bicycle lights. I began to mingle with fellow short-sleeves... and that's when I saw her. Madge. Black boots, black pants, black turtleneck, black scarf, black cap, black gloves. She was going all Call of Duty for this game -- of course. Why wouldn't she be a try-hard at Capture the Flag too? And I just knew I'd have to tag her the fuck out. This was my chance to prove I was better at something.

The first few rounds, us short-sleeves did terribly because no one stayed behind to defend, so we lost 3 rounds promptly. Each time they blew the whistle, I could hear Madge laughing. I could hear it. So I switched to defense. To prevent ""camping"", there was a 50 meter buffer around each ""flag"". Conveniently for me, there was a group of hedges 50 meters away from my flag. So I hid in the hedges.

Each time anyone from the other team tried to sneak up to our flag, I'd jump out of the hedges, startle the hell out of them, and that would give me the time I needed to run up and tag them out. I'd probably tagged out 8-10 people in about 15 minutes, when the stars aligned, and I saw her. Madge. Walking through the shadows along the side of a building, headed straight for our flag, thinking she was so sneaky with all her matching black gear. This was it. It was *my time to shine*.

But I was too excitable. I bounded from the hedges like Sea Biscuit while she was still a good 40-50 feet away. So I yelled ""AAAaarrgh!"" to try to emphasize the startling effect. She shrieked in surprise, but without missing a beat, she spun around 180 degrees and headed back for her ""side"" at a dead sprint. I then realized that if she got to her side before I caught her, she'd be ""out of play"" and I couldn't tag her out -- that was an impossible embarrassment, I couldn't allow it. I took off too, at a dead sprint. Like Gimli, I'm not so much for long runs, but dangerous across short distances. I was gaining on her, and now confidently puffed up, with a laugh I shouted ""YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED!""

The chase lasted probably 100-150 feet before she tripped on a tree root and fell pretty hard, but made no attempt to get back up. As I got closer, I realized she had stooped to a whole new low - playing the crying game, surely exaggerating an injury that would thus make my ""tagging"" of her distasteful. But then as I got closer still, I realized she was *really* crying, like *hysterically* crying. I was still mad, so as I got up to her I said ""Crying won't fucking help"", at which point she rolled on to her back and looked up at me and shouted ""GET THE FUCK AWAY!"". I leaned down to make eye contact and said ""it's just a fucking game"", to which she cocked an eyebrow and said ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!""

And then it hit me.

I did not recognize this girl.

*This was not Madge.*

This was some girl walking to the bus station after a night class.

Horrified, mouth hanging open, the rolodex of my mind spun as I suddenly imagined what it must have been like from her perspective: a large, strange, bearded, sweaty, under-dressed man jumped out of the bushes screaming ""AAARRRRrrrgh!"", and when she ran, he ran too, screaming ""YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED"", and when he saw her crying, said ""Crying won't fucking help"".

I wanted to apologize, I wanted to introduce myself, I wanted to explain, but all I could get out was ""Hey... sorry -- it was, it's just... Hi, I'm... Hey, you know, Capture the Flag?... PLEASE DON'T CALL THE POLICE, THIS WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING"" and then I ran away hoping she hadn't seen enough of my face to create a composite sketch for Campus Security.

I never ended up tagging her, or Madge for that matter, and I never went back to Capture the Flag after that (I hear it may be getting cancelled) but I probably caused some seriously deep-seated anxieties about night classes that will haunt that poor girl forever.

Dear night class girl, if you're a Redditor, I am so sorry. I'm actually a pretty nice guy, really.

TL;DR - Today I fucked up by wanting to get back at a snooty know-it-all from Ecology class by chasing her down at a night game of Capture The Flag only to realize I'd chased down (and probably subsequently scarred) some girl from night class who wasn't even playing.

**EDIT:** Wow, thanks for the Reddit gold, guys - I'd say ""you surprised me and popped my gold cherry"" but that expression would seem to be in poor taste after my story. 

**EDIT:** I never realized how much I made it sound like she broke her neck at first. Holy shit. Also, I laughed my ass off at how many people say there's sexual tension between me and Madge. Fucking Madge.      ... But maybe there is tension. Maybe I am in love with her... holy shit MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE! Jk lol I really still hate her. ",TheTrueMountainMan

non_PTSD,"So I got some really good advice from you guys a month ago regarding my new idea: a Wraith Host enslaved by an Archon and his Dark Eldar cronies. My plan is to model the Wraiths to look evil and spiky, and even put some Raider sails on the Wraithknight and Wave Serpent. Let me know what you think of my list before I start buying some of the models please! I trust you guys to know what I'm probably doing wrong. P.S. this list is semi-competitive. I don't plan on winning tournaments with it, but I also want it to keep up with the Taucurions, Decurions, and other-curions.


The idea was to put the Spiritseer, Archon, and 5 Wraithguard into a Wave Serpent and deep strike them. Put two squads of Wraithguard in Raiders and either deep strike or run them up the board. And then have 2 squads of Warriors in Venoms for camping on objectives and weight of fire against low armor targets. I'm not sure about how to outfit the Wraithlord (necessary for the formation), and how to best use the Spiritseer (also necessary). Has anybody had success/failure with using the WWP on a Wave Serpent? Any ideas at all would be great. I was deciding between a Wraith Host and Tau for my next army, and the new Tau formations make me feel a lot less dirty for really wanting to play with the awesome looking Wraith models.

2 units of Wraithguard are assigned Raiders are take advantage of the cover saves to make their way across the field, not sure whether to unload them or to use the flame templates from inside the open-topped vehicle. 1 unit of Wraithguard act as a personal bodyguard for the Archon, using the Webway Portal to come in on turn 2+  at the exact location that D-flamers can do the most devastating blow, Spiritseer will be attached to the unit as well (I think? need to reread Independent Character rules) and if he can, he'll be rolling Telepathy and fishing for Invisibility. The 2 min squads of Warriors in their respective Venoms will be for objectives and midfield business, the Wraithknight will do what Wraithknights do best, and the Jetfighter is to help alleviate the fact that if the opponent is running a bunch of flyers, I'm three different kinds of fucked.

Deploy the Dreadknights and the Interceptor Squads behind LOS and shunt them turn one. Each Terminator squad gets a ML 3 Librarian rolling Sanctic and a ML 1 Inquisitor rolling Pyromancy (or Divination, not sure) the goal is to deep strike them turn one using servo skulls to reduce any YOLO deep strike catastrophes and hit the foot slogging troops hard with a mix of Cleansing Flame, Flame Breath, the Psycannons, or whichever other fun spells I get. The Interceptors will deal with lower priority targets (like a faraway Vindicare or something) and the Dreadknights will deal with heavier troops/vehicles. The Stormraven will be riding by itself and will sweep up whatever vehicle or monstrous creature I couldn't crack.

First Law Trilogy and standalones by Joe Abercrombie. Fantastic narrator.

Gentleman Bastards series by Scott Lynch. Michael Page nails the narration.

I switched to Smolov after a fruitless cycle of candito's program that actually lowered my squat and dead max by 10 pounds a piece. Granted, it was a tough time of the semester and I wasn't taking care of myself the way I should have, but I knew that to stay motivated I needed a serious change.

I hopped on Smolov's program. Before a lot of people go off about how ridiculous Smolov is, I'm going to preface by saying I agree. It's a crazy level of volume, an insane amount of risk, and I don't recommend it to a beginner or even a low level intermediate for your weight class. You should have outstanding squat form for every rep, even when fatigued, and not rely on a belt for heavy reps. But that being said...

I made unbelievable progress running just the base cycle of this program, and after the 2 week switching phase, I plan to finish the entire program. I was away from my usual gym for my 1RM testing and was unable to get a video recording of the 355, but my [physical progress](http://i.imgur.com/BVAJTO6.jpg) (pseudo NSFW) speaks volumes. This is barely a month of lifting, and the amount of weight I tacked on to my legs baffles me. I went from just under 150 lbs to 160 on an empty stomach, and nearly all of that mass is in my legs.

The workouts were hard. I particularly wasn't fond of the 7 sets of 5, and I needed serious concentration to get through every rep and every set. Last friday I had to squat 10 sets of 3 at 92% of my entered 1RM, and thats how I knew my max had jumped.

non_PTSD,"I feel like this is a critical question.  Almost every other question in this bizarre case seems to have at least one plausible explanation (albeit, often those explanation belong to different parties).  However, to me, the question of who burned Theresa has NO reasonable explanation for any party involved.  Here's my logic and I look forward to your comments.

STEVE AVERY:

It seems absurd for him to have burned the body.  He either burned it at his house which is entirely stupid, and risky, especially given his invitation to people to come to his bonfire.  But beyond that, he would never move a few bones to the quarry or into the burn barrel.  The idea of him moving the girl to the quarry, burning her there, and then moving her back fits no usable timeline, makes no sense as to why he would return all the evidence to within meters of his own home, and is just not at all a rational solution to getting rid of the body.  

THE POLICE (non killers):

First off I honestly find it hard to believe that they would go through the immense trouble of BURNING the body to begin with.  Why wouldn't they just dump the body somewhere on the Avery property then?  I also find it very unlikely that someone intimately involved happened to find the body, silently and quickly determine on a plan to BURN IT and then move it to Avery's, without anyone noticing.  It seems entirely much more likely whoever FOUND the body would report it, or there would be evidence or indications of this.  

THE POLICE (killers):

This would be the total, full blown massive conspiratorial set-up.  I'm not willing to go nearly that far.  I don't believe they would kill a random (and how would they even know to kill Theresa anyway), and if they did, why not kill an Avery or some other undesireable?  Just too crazy a theory to consider.  Also would point out that, if the police did it, why would those random few bones be found at the quarry at all?  I don't feel like they would even allow those bones to be found.

MIKE/EX BOYFRIEND/ROOM-MATE:

Mike seems super sketchy to me and the ex boyfriend only slightly less so.  However, if they killed her, I doubt they would have any means to understand how to set up Steve Avery beforehand.  Once they did, they didn't even have access to the compound anyway.  There's no way to think they would know there was bonfires that night also.  I think they are sketchy, but I don't see how the two of them would have every known (or had opportunity) to burn the body and move it to SA's.

BOBBY and his STEP DAD:

First off, just because their alibi ended up off by an hour, I don't believe them to be the killers.  But where would they kill her and why?  They would have to be transporting her car and/or body all over the place (unless randomly she was in the quarry and they killed her there, which is a huge random occurrence ).  Even still, bringing the remains back to meters from their own home would be really dumb.  By the time they realized Steve Avery was the prime suspect, they couldn't risk moving the bones back anyway.  

SOMEONE RANDOM:

Why would they burn the body?  And how would the bones move to Steve's house?  This theory requires some absurd coincidence that is beyond belief.  

Makes no sense to me, I don't see how the bones end up there in any rational situation, by anyone.  ",merlin401

The resume, which was now in the garbage in 8 pieces, could easily be reconstructed to find the candidate's email address.  I then typed up this email:

> Dear [Name],

> Thank you again for your interest in [company].  During the latter stages of our interview, there may have been an event that could have been perceived as a negative reaction on my part.  Any such misconception is regrettable, and so I wanted to connect with you to clear up any misconceptions.  In fact, in our company's 7-category scoring metric for interviewed candidates, I even scored you as ""fairly competitive"".  Best wishes here or elsewhere in this exciting stage of your employment search journey.

>Best,
>[name]

Next, I copied and pasted the email to Reddit and deleted it since actually sending it would cause many Redditor's heads to literally explode, and furthermore the candidate might respond by returning with a new resume and stapling it to my warm misunderstood heart.

Finally I went up to the hiring manager and we discussed the various candidates. As there were several that were essentially equally qualified and also several positions open, a gentle nudge in her direction was enough to get the woman hired.  (And there was much rejoicing.  Yay...)

ADMISSION 1:  This was never quite as dramatic or tragic a story as it might have seemed, as the position is for a part-time adjunct professor.  Since usually they will teach classes at 2 or 3 colleges each semester, getting or not getting a job from one college is probably not the end of the world.  Of course, my original action was always a horrible gaffe that needed correction!  But since we were able to get her hired and since I'll see her shortly, I'm not going to awkwardly reach out now but instead laugh it off together when the time comes.  

ADMISSION 2:  Through much of the first thread, I felt like a wealthy land owner during the Communist purges, with the furor of the working class proletariat really rising up at me:  It was something to behold, although I seemed to quickly develop a Stalin-like ability to dismiss negative feedback at will (ah, but never to downvote it!)
   
Tl,dr:  She was hired :)
",merlin401
non_PTSD,"Actually, I was the interviewer.  Although the main interview and hiring is done by someone else, they are sent to me for 10-15 minutes at the end since I'm the person they will directly be interfacing with.  I always get a print out of their resume beforehand which I glance at during the interview..  

Well today I had an interview and it went fine.  At the end we got up and I told the woman that it was nice to meet her and we'd let her know.  But, since the resume has absolutely no future use to me, I was absentmindedly ripping it up and throwing it in the trash in front of her as I said this.  The look of horror on her face was tangible.  It was only about 15 seconds after she walked out the door that I realized what I had done and how soul-crushing it must have felt!

So to poor interview woman I say now:  ""Sorry!  You were actually a decent candidate!""

non_PTSD,"I'm taking it for granted that baseball will never get rid of the DH due to the player's union, and that it will inevitably play by a single set of rules given continuous inter-league play, declining pitcher aptitude batting, and occasional injury due to a pitcher ""needlessly"" batting.

I prefer the NL style of baseball by a wide margin as there is, in my mind, infinitely more strategy involved, especially in extra inning games where resource management becomes essential.  So how about this as a compromise:

Instead of the DH covering the pitcher *slot*, the DH would be able to hit for a particular pitcher.  So, for example, when the starting pitcher left the game, his DH would also have to leave the game.  A new DH would enter the game and stick with that pitcher for as long as he is the pitcher who is supposed to bat.  I feel this would (mostly) preserve the NL style game and strategy and satisfy the other side as well.  In some sense it even adds some more subtle strategy on lineup construction.

This happenned about 20 minutes ago.

Some background: I work at a publicity agency, we do a lot of P.O.P. material such as coolers, pens, pendrives, audio devices, etc. for lots of brands big or smalls, our main office is in Venezuela and we have a secondary one in Dominican Republic.

So, today our Dominican office finished the production of some LED medals for a well known toilet paper brand, they sended us (Venezuelan office) the pictures of the finished product via whatsapp, I was in my car when this happenned and I kept thinking why would a toilet paper brand want to gift people some LED medals when it just occurred to me ""ITS A MEDAL FOR PERFECT DUMPS!!!!!!"", being totally awesome as I am as soon as I arrived to my office I notice that we were talking with the Dominican office so this bright idea of sharing my knowledge  with everyone kicks me and I basically screamed ""AND THE AWARD TO THE PERFECT DUMP, NO SHIT IN THE FIRST WIPE, WINNER OF THIS (insert toilet paper brand name here) MEDAL GOES TO!!!!!!!"" and I stopped at this point waiting for someone to say a name but instead I received a lot of mean looks and ""try not to augh"" faces when my boss still staring at me tells me in a deep voice ""we are having a phone meeting with the director of (toilet paper brand name) at this moment Mr.(last name) to check if he was pleased with the product, would you like to say something else to him besides what you just said?"" to what my answer was ""Yes, I totally love the paper you make, if you all excuse me I will be in my office"".... **ninja retreat**

So here I am still waiting for the call to end and face my destiny.

TL;DR: Screamed in the mid of a call that a product was made to award people who take the perfect dump.

non_PTSD,"This happened about 3 hours ago... Be me, 29 years old male, living in probably the most corrupted country in the world (Venezuela).  So just to give you some background, Venezuela is in a very difficult situation, political and economical,  the majority of us want to get rid of this corrupted government and we have elections in a fee days so tension is palpable in the streets, police and military are corrupted as fuck (you can buy weapons such as grenades or sub machine guns to them,  etc etc) basically hate is in the air. So, I was in a traffic jam, one of the many we have daily when the hunger hit me, I had a big bag of Doritos in my car so I decided to eat, I have a gastric bypass and can't eat that much, I was eating with my window open when a motorcycle with 2 military officers (low rank) stand beside me waiting for their turn to pass, I see the guy in the back literally drooling looking at the Doritos so ""why not? I won't eat this much"" I offer him the bag and he didn't hesitate to take it with a very big smile and thanking me.... 20 seconds later the shit storm!!!! The driver next to me gets out of his car screaming ""you fu*king thieves! Let the guy alone he have done nothing to you""  (he thought I was being black mailed and I got asked for money inside the bag wich is one of many ways for them to get paid black mailing you),  I get out of the car to explain that it wasn't money but hell no,  the military officer that was driving told me in not a such a pleasant way to stay inside the car that he could handle it....  He gets down the bike and goes to the guy that was screaming baton in hand when all of a sudden no less than 20 people are surrounding him screaming ""thief!!!! Oppressor!!! Go to hell""  and start punching him. Military #2 gets downy to help his friend and getting punched and screamed he managed to get military #1 in the bike and proceed to drive as fast as he could... Everyone get to their cars and guy #1 gets to me Doritos in hand ""here's your money"".....  Now I have back my Doritos in my car and sadness in my heart for how deep this society has fallen... 


But I have half a bag of Doritos to eat in the traffic jam tomorrow and I have that going for me wich is nice. 

TL;DR: 2 military officers got their ass kicked for a bag of Doritos I gift them.

Ive been a gamer for a long long time, supaplex, prince of persia (the floppy one), etc....

3 games I totally love: Counter Strike (for fps), Priston Tale (mmorpg an oldie but gold) and Lineage 2 (mmorpg played it for almost 8 years)

3 games I totally hate: COD (multiplayer, single player is ok), Final Fantasy (I LOVE watching someone else play it and the history is amazing BUT I hate the play style) and Need for Speed franchise (i just dont like car games lol)

My biggest deceptions at the moment: well only 2, the first one is not being able to play all the time I would like (because work you know) and not being able to afford Arma 3 (being an fps/tactical addict I want to play this game but shit happens, **read the first paragraph**)

non_PTSD,"Hello again! Im doing this new post since I have received a lot of privates regarding the monetary system here in Venezuela because Im my previous (introduction) post I mentioned it so I will try to explain it in the less confussing way I can so you can keep up to it and be amazed of how (f word here) my country is.

First of all: our currency name is ""Bolivares, bs"" yes, as in bulls**t lol.
There are 2 prices or exchange rates for usd here, the first one or the ""legal one"" is the one you get from the government to purchase via internet, wich is 1usd = 15bs. at this price you can spend a MAX of 200usd yearly to purchase items via internet and if you are going to travel you can spend a max of 2300usd per year, meaning that if you do 5 trips a years you can spend 2300/5= 460usd per trip to pay for all you need to pay for, food, car, hotels, etc.
Our second exchange rate or the ""ilegal one / black market"" is to purchase usd from any other source wich is not the government and you can only purchase cash this way, the exchange rate is 1usd = 137.48bs (as of today since the price varies from day to day) meaning that my monthly pay in my work is 5000bs/137.48= 36.36usd at the black market exchange or 5000/15= 333.33 usd at ""legal"" exchange, but I cant do the convertion at legal exchange since every prodcut we buy is calculated at black market.

ok so the proccess, you need a credit card and every year you need to fill a 2 pages form asking for that 200usd internet coupon to be unlocked for your use that year (I need to do this on January 2015) AND i need to fill another form for every trip I will do in the year explaining why im going to travel, where am i going to stay, for how long (this is very important because for example if I go to florida for 5 days the only give me 500usd to spend but if I got for more than 8 days they give me 1000usd even if im staying for 3 months).

Once you fill this forms you need to wait for the government approval and if they think theres no problem that you spend that money then they will unlock it, or not if they dontwant to.

IF for some reason you spend more than 200usd a year via internet you need to pay a really expensive fee and you are banned from using usd for 2 years. (yahoo)

As i said I live in Venezuela where our government have a restriction of 200$ PER YEAR to purchase stuffs over internet (if we travel deppending of the destination we can spend a max of 2500$ a year) so I normally use wishlists to keep track of the items I want to buy so I can do so every January (thats when we get our new year coupon of 200$) and I created a new wishlist with everything I would like to buy  this new year 2015 but as you can see Im going to have to select a few items because the total price is over 200$.

non_PTSD,"About 10 years ago in my horny teen boy years (14-16) I used to go online to chatrooms or webcam sites to get off. I was also bi-curious and talked to other boys and probably men. I decided to record some videos of myself and send them to people online. My parents just got a new video camera and gave me their old one. It was one of those pre-digital, cassette tape kinds. So I took all these very raunchy videos of myself, jerking myself off, spreading my ass, cumming onto myself, putting things up my butt etc. It was after that I realized I had no idea how to upload the film onto my computer. So I just forgot about it. Years passed, I went to college, moved away, became a normal adult, etc. 

This weekend I've been at my parents house for a family gathering including aunts/uncles/grandparents. Yesterday after dinner I was out in the yard playing soccer with my younger cousins while most of the adults were inside watching old family videos...... After a couple hours I go inside into the living room and see my uncle has rigged up that old cassette camcorder to the TV. Immediately my memory is flooded with my nasty antics, my heart hits 200 bpm. My mom must have dug it up when I moved out and saved it. I quickly look at the screen. It's my sisters high school basketball game. I try to remember if I destroyed the tape. I must have. How could I not? The basketball game cuts to a family vacation to a lava flow field. My dad making goofy faces and me being a moody twat. I cringe at my too-cool-for-this behavior. Uncle presses fast-forward, blurs of black-gray rock formations fly past, then abruptly transitions into a fleshy mass of humiliation. It's hard to make out what's going on but I know instantly. My uncle presses play; I die inside. There I am, laid on my back, legs raised up against a table, pointing my underage dick at my face beating off and moaning. ""Oh goodness"" said grandma.

non_PTSD,"My roommate goes shopping on Sunday evenings. He bought a carton of eggs. Last night after shopping he went out, and I knew he'd probably not be back that night.

So I decided to scramble every egg from the carton. I ate some of them (It was always my intention to replace the egg carton, just to get that out of the way), and the rest I stuffed the scrambled egg back into the carton. So it was just a carton of scrambled egg. 

Then on the back of the carton I wrote ""Pre Scrambled"" in marker. 

This morning I hear my roommate exclaim ""What the fuck!?"" 

I ran into the kitchen and saw him staring dumbfounded at the carton. He kept looking from me to the carton and back. ""Did you buy the Pre-Scrambled kind?"" I asked. 

He looked at me like I had just spoken Saturnian, so I repeated my question. ""The fuck do you mean?"" he replied. 

I took the carton from him, acted like I was carefully examining the packaging, and then pointed out the writing on the back. Pre-Scrambled. ""Yeah, you bought Pre-Scrambled Eggs,"" I said. 

He looked as perplexed as it is possible for a person to be. Maximum perplexness. 

I put on an act of being amazed that he had never heard of Pre-Scrambled eggs, and about how I always check the back of the carton to make sure they aren't Pre-Scrambled. 

He stammered something along the lines of ""But what...but why...how...why would they...what the...why..."" 

I was about to reveal it was a prank when he suddenly got very serious and intense, like a late-season Walter White sort of vibe, and he said ""Fuck no. Not my eggs."" Then he wheeled around and marched out of the apartment. Out to his car. And he left. 

I was a bit concerned. And probably should have shouted after him before he left. But I didn't. 

So like 40 minutes pass and I hear our apartment door open, and I hear ""I'm banned! I'm banned from the Stop & Shop! Banned!"" 

I walk out to the kitchen with some apprehension. He looks enraged. ""Banned!"" He dropped the egg carton on the floor. ""Did you fuck me!?""

He wasn't taking it well. 

""They don't fuckin sell this shit!!! Did you fuck me!?"" 

At this point I admitted to pranking him. And I apologized. He just stared at me for a moment, then shouted something like ""You're buying me fucking new eggs!!"" Then he slammed his bedroom door. Then he opened it and yelled ""I have to drive to motherfucking PATHMARK, are you kidding me!? You go too far!! FUCK!!!"" And slammed the door again. Then he opened it again and shouted ""STOP LAUGHING!!!"" and slammed the door again. 

I do feel bad about this because it was never the intention of the prank to get him banned from the supermarket. I have already replaced his eggs and I am in the process of thinking up some way to make it up to him regarding his banishment.

Overall I'd give it a solid 9/10, the game isn't perfect but it's pretty damn good.

I've invested something around 15 hours into this game since picking it up on November 3rd and having played it for so long I feel like I can give some decent feedback on most of the little details.


**GOOD THINGS**

- Visual customization is done very well, although not perfect (details discussed in ""NOT-SO-GOOD THINGS"")

- Wraps and Paint was also good, but again, not perfect

- The car list had a nice selection to pick from

- A variety of different events kept things interesting and more importantly stopped the game from feeling repetitive

- The inclusion of real-life automotive icons in the story added a sense of realism and made me care more about what I was doing

- Visuals and graphics (both the cars and the city itself) were excellent

- The Handling slider was the perfect way to please everyone, allowing players to choose how their car feels on the road


**NOT-SO-GOOD THINGS (and my suggestions to improve them)**

Ok, so this section is going to be a little more in-depth, because I want to clearly list my reasons for the following (minor) complaints.

**1**

The visual customization was a little deceptive.  While it is true that for the lower-end Tuner cars there were quite a few options to make them look completely different, some of the higher-end cars barely had anything available to them.  

Take the Ferrari 458 for example.  I grinded and saved up to buy it only to find out that there's only 1 available body kit and that I can't even change the rims on it.  

As a result, every higher-end car I see out on the streets looks almost exactly the same (apart from color) because there aren't many options for them.

My suggestion would be to add some more parts for the cars that are lacking them, such as a body kit for the 458 that makes it look like the Speciale, or the DMC kit for the Aventador.

And I understand that this may not be possible due to legal reasons and not being able to get the rights from their respective companies, but if Need For Speed can create its own splitters in the game, then why not create its own body kits?  Isn't that what they did in Most Wanted (2005) and Carbon?

It's a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless.


**2**

As far as Paint and Wrap goes, the decal editor could use some sort of display showing grid coordinates and degree of rotation (kind of like what they use in Forza).  For example, sometimes when creating a stripe, I wouldn't be able to tell if my rectangle had been rotated perfectly 90 degrees, and it would end up looking ever-so-slightly slanted.  And if I wanted to make a duplicate stripe on the other side, it would be hard to tell exactly the exact position of its counterpart. 

For this reason, a Mirror-copy option would be very helpful.

On certain portions of the map, it got a little too rainy and the screen seemed to be covered with a weird haze.  I understand it's all part of the environment, but that haze on the screen really seemed to dull the otherwise outstanding visuals.  

If we had an option to tone down the haze or rain effects on the screen, that would be fantastic.


**4**

As far as car selection goes, I was very pleased but also somewhat confused.  Early on when the game was announced, the developers stated that the cars they would include were the ones that were usually common on the automotive scene, cars that were commonly customized.  So imagine my surprise when I see the BMW M2 and the McLaren 570S, cars that came out in the real world very recently.

I know this is a very minor nit-pick, but I just feel like they could have been a bit wiser with the car choices.  For example, we have the Scion FR-S, the Subaru BRZ and the Toyota GT86, which for all intents and purposes, are exactly the same.  I just feel like they could have gotten rid of two of them and included something like the Audi R8 or Porsche Carrera GT.

And speaking of Audi, I would have really liked to see at least one of them.

I have a sort of ""wish list"" of cars that I would like to see at the bottom of this post, if you're interested.


**5**

The ""Always Online"" thing wasn't a huge issue while playing, but I really wish it wasn't necessary.  

Again, these are minor nit-picks but they are issues nonetheless.  

Sometimes, finding a game with players took a bit too long, and then there were the server maintenance messages popping up.  I want to be clear to anyone who's reading this, THIS ONLY HAPPENED TWICE, so don't feel discouraged from playing the game because of something so small.

All I'm saying, is that if we had the option to play the game offline, it would be a lot faster than searching for a lobby of players and a stable server.

Why not just do the same thing you did with NFS Rivals?  Populate the world with AI drivers and let us go about our business offline.


**6** 

There were very minor framerate drops every once in a while.  I felt the game lag randomly for a split second.  I never got severely messed up but it did cause me to crash once or twice.


**7**

There's one section of road in particular that kind of bugged me.  It's on one the highways, when you exit the tunnel, the lighting goes abnormally dark for a split second before returning to normal.  I'm not sure if it's just me or if it applies to everyone, but that's just something I noticed.  If you could somehow patch it that'd be great.  I'll edit this post with an imgur link when I pinpoint the exact location on the game map.

By the way, has anyone else noticed this?


**8**

The Mazda RX-7 should not have a camshaft option in the Performance Upgrades section, just saying.  Again, minor detail, but it's the minor details that make the gamers really appreciate what you've created, isn't it?

**Wrapping Up**

Ok then, that's about it.  Like I said, overall I really like the game, and if this is the new direction NFS is going, I'm all for it.

Here now is a list of cars I would like to see.  Not demanding anything, simply suggesting possible content for future DLC:

- Aston Martin (any)
- Audi (any)
- Dodge Charger (new Hellcat or SRT8)
- Ford GT (last generation)
- Jaguar (XFR or F Type maybe?)
- Lamborghini Gallardo
- Lexus (any)
- Maserati GranTurismo S
- McLaren (12c or 650S)
- Mitsubishi Evo X
- Porsche Carrera GT
- Subaru WRX STI

First, a few weeks ago my car broke down... it happened at the most awful time. Right before rent was due. Lucky we still had my SO's car. Rides have been a little rough since she works mornings and I work afternoons. Even though it was rough, it was still managable. Until today... my gf woke up to find a huge branch on top of her car cracking the windshield denting the side of the door and hood. Now we are both temporarily carless. Her fix is covered under insurance but it will still take some time for them to fix the damages. My car I'm waiting till payday to get it fixed.. just been pretty tough times and I usually don't feel this crappy but this time I do. I kept thinking things could only get better but they dont. They only got worse.

Tl;dr my car broke down, then a big branch fell on top of my SO'S car and things feel like they are getting worse

I slept over and fell asleep. Her parents aren't supposed to come home till around noon so we figured it's perfect since my girlfriend has to be at work by 9am. Well my friends, her dad came home! Now I am currently stuck in her room trying to be as quite as possible. My girlfriend left to work already and I have work in less than 3 hours. I can't sneak out because her bedroom is upstairs and he is downstairs working on shit on the computer. I will update you guys as soon as I'm out of here. Hopefully it's soon

Edit: I've been stuck for over an hour now. No signs of him leaving. My back is starting to cramp up from not moving. Less than 2 hours until I have to be at work

Edit 2: since so many of you keep telling me to jump out the window. I was considering it but realistically there is no way I could go through the whole thing without making a lot of noise. http://imgur.com/G59DaVB

Final update: FRONT PAGE!? thanks everyone!
Damn.. a lot of you guys really wanted me to get caught. Thanks for all the suggestions and advice! I ended up waiting It out. The dad ended up taking a shower and I thought that would have been my chance but I started to think about how I sometimes leave the water running to warm up before jumping in. I didnt want to die today so I waited again. Finally he left just on time for me to run home and leave for work.  but seriously? You guys wanted me to kill him, tie myself up and pretend to be kidnapped, someone suggested making out with the mother? Idk how that would help. I didnt do no ninja jump off the second story.

non_PTSD,"This happened a couple weeks ago. I’m using a throwaway because I don’t want this shit tied to my main account. I’ll try to make this as short as possible. 

**Additional warning**: *I’m in my early twenties and not that experienced when it comes to sexy times. All the porn in the world couldn’t have prepared me for this.*

I was going out with a girl for about 6 months. It was nice. She was freaky. I liked it. She kept hinting towards butt stuff which I’ve never done. I was skeptical, but after talking to my friends about it, they encouraged me to give it a shot and to be ""open minded.""

We’re driving one day listening to music and some song comes on and one of the lyrics were “you gotta eat the booty like groceries.” I’ll never forget this fucking song. The GF knows the song and she’s singing the lyrics and she’s looking directly at me while singing that line. Subliminal message.

Fast forward a couple days and she’s over at my place taking a shower, getting ready for work. I join. Sexy time. “Be open minded” rang through my mind. So I decided to try something new. I tried to eat the booty. I even went as far as to stick my tongue in her butt. I heard a “oh” and then the worst shit **ever** happened. She farted. I jerk back. Mind you, we’re still in the shower so I’m thinking the water mixed with the fart and I have nasty fart water in my mouth. No.

I spit the water out and it’s not just water. She pooped in my mouth. It wasn’t a lot, but that’s no excuse.

She started apologizing, but her sorrow turned into straight laughter. She wouldn’t stop laughing. I was so angry I didn’t know what to do.

TL;DR: I tried to eat the booty like groceries. It didn’t work. ",beopenmindedtheysaid

non_PTSD,"Today my wife decided that it would be a nice idea to take a shower together. We do it all of the time and it is a nice way to kick start our night together after work. 

It was a typical shower which consists of her using all of the water with me being left in the cold waiting for my turn in the warm water.

After a while she decided to forfeit the water and let me have my turn. I grabbed my body wash off the shelf and proceeded to drop it. This is where I fucked up.

I quickly bent down to grab it. I bent at the knees remembering that it's bad for you to bend down to grab something only using your waist. 

I was soon met with a painful sensation that I had never experienced before. The small push/ pull valve that changes the water from the faucet to the shower head penetrated my virgin ass. 

The pain was unreal. The water changed from the shower head to the faucet. I shot up trying to get away from the metal knob that just violated me. Upon standing up the shower resumed. 

I stood there in shock looking up at my wife. She witnessed the entire thing. She won't stop laughing at me about it. It hurts to sit.

TL;DR: Showered with my wife trying to put something in her. Ended up with something in me.

Edit: Wording. 

It figures that my most successful post to date is about something metal entering my ass.

We have done skype sexy time before and that's where I thought this was leading. So I flopped it out and skyped her my erect penis taking up the entire screen. Then when she answered it was her entire family: mum, dad and two little sisters (7&9) there yelling in unison ""happy anniversary"" I freaked out and slammed the laptop shut. I since have received two messages from my girlfriend (soon to be ex I imagine) saying ""what the fuck was that?!!"" And ""ANSWER ME!!""

It is the a definite dumbest thing I've ever done. I kinda wanna die right now.

I have two email accounts from my website, but I can only connect to one of them via Outlook.

One works absolutely fine but the other will not connect and I cannot fathom a reason as to why this could be. What I have tried so far:

1. Deleting and setting up account again

2. Adding the account to Outlook on multiple computers.

3. Changing SSL settings off/on and subsequent port numbers (995/110)

The aspect which is confusing me is the mail from the particular account is coming through via BlackBerry perfectly fine. It just seems to be Outlook which cannot access it.

I have set up mail forwarding on the account via the webmail app on the host website, but obviously this is a makeshift measure for the time being, and would like to be able to use Outlook as normal.

Usually these kinds of essay would not be too much of a problem, but I have been instructed to include references to learning theories, aswell as linking to academic theories of consultancy, teamworking, leadership and motivation, with emphasis on what was learnt. 

The staple theories that I know well are Belbin and Tuckman, but this is really the extent of it.


Including academic citations and basing my experiences around real theory is not something I have been previously asked of when completing other reflective reports, and so I am naturally a little wary as this would be the first time of doing so.


I am having a bit of a mindblock in regards to how to go about structuring the essay in an intelligent format and in a way that presents a solid narrative.

I was due to attend a university for a guided tour and interview and we were allowed to bring a guest with us. I decided to bring my dad because he's a fun guy to make the trip with and thought he might be interested in looking around.

So I'm filling out all the details on the online booking form and it asks ""Who will be attending with you?"". Now here's the fuckup, rather than typing in my dad's name, I enter "" My Father"". Clearly I was thinking a tad too literally.

So I forget about this for a few weeks and we finally end up going. When we get there, they are calling out names and handing out visitor badges in pairs, one for prospective students and one for their guests. I receive my pair of badges, one with my name on and the other simply with the words ""My Father"" on. I show my dad, hoping he'll laugh it off and I can go explain and get a different name badge but instead he insists on wearing the badge all day, kindly explaining to everyone how stupid I was.",Carotti

non_PTSD,"So I remembered about 1 hour ago that tomorrow is Mother's Day, this was about 20:30. Mum was working in her office so I had to come up with some excuse as to why I was going out. I said ""I'm really craving some Cuppa Soup, be back in a minute"". 

So I drive down to Tesco's pick up some of Mum's favourite chocolates - Maltesers and some more fancy ones. and a choice of 2 types of cards which were left. Managed to pay at the self service checkout without getting into an argument which was nice.

I get home and I realise I have to somehow get back upstairs without carrying a Tesco's bag full of Mother's Day crap. I put the kettle on and run upstairs and ask Mum if she wants a cup of coffee. She does. I go back downstairs and make Mum her coffee and myself a cuppa soup.

Now, I somehow have to carry the chocolates, coffee and my cuppa soup upstairs to my Mum's office without her seeing the chocolates. I stuff the card and chocolates into my jacket and grab the two mugs in each hand. I start walking up the stairs when I realise I am rattling, the Maltesers aren't exacty subtle. Once I get to my Mum's office to put her coffee down, the Malteser's start to slide, so I hunch over to try and keep them in. I put Mum's coffee down and retract my hand to hold my bulging jacket in just a bit too quickly, somehow I manged to pull over my Mum's cup of coffee and it went all over her desk, nearly ruining her laptop and getting on various pieces of paper. In my hastiness to try and prevent the coffee from spilling over, I ended up sloshing the cup of soup down my Jeans. This didn't hurt at first, but whilst I was furiously apologising to my mum, I realised how badly my fucking leg hurt. I clutched my thigh, releasing the arm which was holding the chocolates in and they end up on the floor. 

I'm in pain, my mum is pissed at me and its mother's day in 3 hours.

non_PTSD,"Anxiety was smelt on the breath of our team. J4 planted his flag at blue, receiving a shield seemingly made of wind from Janna. I tumbled against the wall to reset my autoattack to help J4 also. Laning begain as usual, but it all kicked off when the enemy Lee Sin came to gank, he extended just far enough to take a single laser beam from the tower  before J4 came to save us. 3 kills on Lee, Quinn and Thresh for me later and I was feeling great about the game. 

The game progressed in a very back and forth manor. Nasus seemed to farm top endlessly winning his matchup against Irelia. Kayle was farming well against Nidalee, but her reticle was set firmly on bot lane. Nidalee came repeatedly bot while Kayle pressured towers in mid lane. It was frustrating for our lane, bringing my score down to a  pitiful 5-5. Some words were exchanged but nothing too intense. 

Later in the game, we had just won a successful teamfight and pushed down an inhibitor tower. We walked out the base once more feeling confident. As we rushed to the dragon which was soon to respawn, we were sure this was ours, the enemy team wasn't in any of our many wards. Little did we know, as we slew the drake, the enemy team were pounding their weapons down on the Baron Nashor.

Now Exhalted with Baron Nashor, we felt pressured back into our base, losing an inner tower. One dive too deep from the enemy Lee Sin led to us destroying most of their baron buffs. Once again feeling on the offensive, we struck deep. But everything went wrong, Nasus was no where to be found and J4's ultimate was little more than a minor inconvenience for the enemy team. We were aced. Our inhibitor went down.

At this point, a small argument broke out between myself and Kayle. I demanded her ultimate be used on me instead of J4. She felt she had done the right thing, but nonetheless no unpleasantness was exchanged. 

Bam, the red icon blinked back into life on the map. Nashor had respawned. J4 was anxious to secure this one and went to ward. He was so keen in fact, he ignored the warnings of both myself and other teammates, walking straight into the bush behind our red buff. 5 enemy team members blew J4 away. Janna was also caught in the crossfire. Nasus decided he could attempt to take on the newly exhalted team who were slightly lower on health now. 5 people briefly chased nasus around the jungle, but he fairly quickly fell to them. Our 2nd inhibitor was slain.

We were defending even more ferociously now. But before the enemies buff of nash wore out, we found ourselves in yet another battle. Our entire team was down apart from myself and Kayle. With her newly bought Runaan's Hurricane and my Infinity Edge we managed to clean up everyone on the enemy team besides Nidalee. She was so fed at this point, she took our now respawned mid inhibitor whilst we were healing from our previous epic battle. 

It took one last battle in our red side jungle before we lost the game. It seemed pointless now. We had such a strong late game team and had worked hard for it but got nothing.

After the game, myself and Kayle entered into a fierce discussion about what went wrong. She claimed that we threw away our advantage whereas I demanded that Lee Sin and Nidalee ganking bot was the reason for this. After some further fierce discussion, we actually realised that we were both correct and both made mistakes. We both decided that the game was the fault of neither of us but a collection of the mistakes we made as a team. 

I ended up adding the Kayle as a friend and continued our discussion, she was pleasant to talk to and it was nice to discuss the game in such great detail. The conversation that I thought would begin in flaming and raging had lead to us having an intense and insightful conversation about the game which we had just played.

non_PTSD,"#The Problem
I recently purchased a high end graphics card for my PC (GTX 760 OC) and noticed absolutely no increase in the FPS on minecraft. The reason for this is that minecraft runs on Java, which by default does not utilise your graphics processor.

#The Solution
First, you will need to right click on your desktop and click nvidia control panel (if you don't have this, it comes default with the driver for your graphics card, so either install from the CD or find it [here](http://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-uk))

Then you need to find the option to manage 3D settings and add a program. The program you want to add is Javaw.exe but you may find it in your recently used programs (only available on the latest version of nvidia control panel). 

[This image shows what you need to do](http://i.imgur.com/tTJNxNh.jpg)

If you don't have recent programs, you can find Javaw in your java folder in either program files or program files (x86).

non_PTSD,"So this happend about a year ago but I felt like it would fit well here. 

My very good friend that I attened elementary school and high school that we'll name ""Levi"" was home for the weekend and I hadn't seen him in about 8 months since he had been deployed to Iraq for his second time since joing the US army in 2011. 

Levi and I have always been close and for second we even considered being a couple (I am a female) but it just never worked out. But I wrote him letters all through his basic training and when he got deployed all through his first 6 months of that as well. 

He is an field artillary man and from our letters back and forth I could tell that he was seeing some things over there but he never went too much into detail besides saying how bored he was and how nice the villagers were near his camp. 

So anyways he gets back home and of course we all (other friends of ours) decide to go out and celebrate! 

Levi and I have always been pretty heavy drinkers around each other. We always encourage each other to get way way way too intoxicated but for the most part it's all been fun and games.
So same thing tonight. We're challanging each other to chug beer after beer, and to attempt the line of shots call the ""Three Wisemen""...... Needless to say I puked all over the bar floor and we were asked kindly to leave the establishment. 


So our group of friends are trying to walk to the bus stop and catch a ride home. I am walking with our good friend Kendra borrowing a cigarette as Levi is stumbling a few feet ahead of us. Basically all I remember next is thinking to my drunken self how happy I am to see Levi again and how much I missed him. I remember getting this bright idea to jump on Levi's back and try to get a piggy-back ride from him, something we used to do often in the hallways of high school. I remember taking off, cigarette still in my hand, and flying at Levi from behind. 

The next morning I woke up in the hospital, I couldn't see out of my left eye and my head was in so much pain I can't even describe. Kendra and my dad were sleeping in the chairs right next to the bed and when I woke up they woke up too. They starting freaking out and a whole bunch of nurses came in and asked me a whole bunch of questions and then my mom showed up and finally I had to shout to every one to shut the fuck up and tell me what happened. 

Kendra's eyes got super wide as she told me, ""You ran up behind Levi and looked like you were trying to jump on him,"" to which I interupted and said, ""Yeah! I was trying to get him to give me piggy back ride!"" 

She shook her head and continued with, ""Dude. He threw you to the ground. He punched you a whole bunch of times in the face and was screaming. It took Hank, Joey, and Oliver to get him off of you. They had to hold him down and call the cops. It was really really bad. You were bleeding every where."" 

Turns out that in my druken state I decided that jumping on a very drunk Army field officer who has seen two tours of war in Iraq was a super good idea and got my mother fucking ass beat. 

My eye socket was broken but other then that all the other injuries were minor scraps, bruises, and such. The police wanted me to press charges and had held Levi over night but I refused as did my parents. We even issued a statement saying that what had happened was my fault and 100% preventable if I hadn't been so stupid. My dad and my grandfather are both ex-military and seriously.... I should have known. 

Levi wouldn't come near me after being released and caught the next flight back to his base 5 states away. He was almost dishonorably discharged except that my dad and my grandfather both called his boss and explained that we were not mad at all or going to press charges that we just wanted to make sure he got to counseling to help some of his PTSD. My dad also learned that Levi's team had lost 6 members his first tour of Iraq in a shoot out (something he has never told any of us back home) which just makes me hurt for him knowing that he's seen his own friends killed.

Levi still has refused to talk to me since that night minus a ""Get Well"" card I recieved with a note saying that ""I will never forgive myself for what I have done. Please find it in your heart to forgive me"". I have tried faccebook, letters, texts, calls, anything to get him to talk to me. So here's my last shot. 

Levi, I know if you read this story you'll know who you are. You're the one who introduced me to reddit so I am hoping you can see this right now. It was me who fucked up, not you. I know better then to come up from behind on someone who has seen what you have seen. I am so sorry. My eye socket healed perfect but I wish we could be friends again.

non_PTSD,"I hope this doesn't seem like i'm karma whoring but I posted this to r/MMA and was advised to share it with you guys. 

Like most TIFU posts this didn't happen today, but in 2007. 
I was 16 and had been training Kung Fu and Krav Maga for about 2 years. My instructor told me I had a gift and to never use my deadly techniques unless it was a life or death situation. I fed off his praise and continued paying the $19.99 monthly fees while believing I was some kind of Caucasian Jet Li. 

Around this time the UFC began to become very popular in New Zealand and everyone was talking about ex-middleweight champion Anderson Silva. Being the martial arts master I was, I decided to rent some UFC DVD's and analyse his technique. His flawless victories were simply not impressive to my delusional 16 year old brain. I thoroughly believed I knew how to dismantle him or basically any MMA fighter for that matter. 

I began boasting around school and to my girlfriend that I was going to be the next big thing in MMA and that I was going to leave school to commence my career as a certified badass. I basically quit school for a month to practice Kung Fu in my garage in addition to the 5-7 pm class at the rec center. 

Following the most cringy montage imaginable, the opportunity to crush my adversaries came with an amateur MMA fight at a warehouse bar in South Auckland. I was unaware at the time but this was actually a Maori gangster clubhouse which hosted incredibly illegal promotions for anyone ballsy enough to fight for the $500 cash prize. My friends older brother who was a gang member got me a spot and basically told me he'd murder me if I didn't show up.. like he stood a chance.  

Fast forward to fight night, I show up with my girlfriend and high school posse for support. The club looked like something out of a movie, leather jacket wearing thugs everywhere and a makeshift arena dead center. The nerves sunk in but I remembered what my electrician / part time Kung Fu master told me about fear and sucked it up. Before my fight, two huge guys were literally pulverizing each other bare knuckle until once collapsed into a mutilated heap onto the canvas. Then came my time to shine. I was announced as a Kung Fu fighter nick-named 'The Soul Eater' and was escorted into the ring. My opponent was in his mid-twenties, tall, muscular and well, actually a fighter. 

Needless to say my flying neck chop didn't bring me home the cheddar and I was hospitalized with a fractured jaw, orbital and bruised rib. Worst part is I had to go back to school where everyone had some incredibly low resolution mobile footage of me getting rag dolled by an angry Maori. 

And that there was the start and end of my fighting career.   


EDIT: Wow, I was not expecting this to get so much attention. I'm thrilled so many of you found happiness in my savage beating. Here's some additional info for those asking. Firstly, I had never properly sparred. My 'contact experience' was more like a game of touch rugby between me and my master with whiny noises and elaborate fist flailing throw in. My garage training consisted of me punching holes in sheets of paper and dry humping one of those foam human torso 'Bobs' or whatever. Secondly I had never been truly punched, let alone by a Maori who may have been an escaped military experiment. 

My mother didn't know what I was up to until she was informed of my hospitalization. She was furious at my master and confronted him during one of his classes. My girlfriend cried a lot and begged me not to fight again, she was really concerned about my opponents safety I guess. Finally, I honestly will try and locate the footage but I haven't seen it in over 5 years and now live in Australia so don't get your hopes up. I will try though.  
 

",sinepynit
non_PTSD,"When I was a teenager I attended Krav Maga and Kung Fu lessons a couple times a week for about 2 years. This was around the time Anderson Silva was rising to fame and he became a hot topic of discussion at my gym. I decided to rent some UFC DVD's to see what all the fuss was about. The first fight I saw of him was when he ko'd Chris Leben. I remember stating that Leben was a ""pussy who can't take a punch"" and that my crane technique would ""put away any UFC fighter"". I actually believed this.  

Fast forward a couple weeks and I decided to enter a really sketchy amateur MMA tournament in South Auckland thinking my then girlfriend would be impressed. The event was hosted in this sort of warehouse bar which actually turned out to be a Maori gangster clubhouse. I was still eager to demonstrate my sweet skills so entered the make shift ring against a pretty legitimate Thai boxer. 

Anyway my flying neck chop failed to secure me the 500 dollar cash prize and I was hospitalised.  

I am now retired for those wondering.

Edit: I wasn't expecting this to be upvoted, so i'll add some further information. This was in 2007 when I was 16 if that can justify my delusion somehow. I had never been in a proper fight before this event and had only sparred Kung Fu style with my friends. My trainer often told me I had true talent and to never fight outside of the gym because I had potential to kill.. I sucked it all in. My girlfriend and I were together for a year after the event and even joked about it together. I was bullied horribly in my last year of high school because of the shitty mobile footage that got around (I will post it if I can find it). ",sinepynit

non_PTSD,"This morning I decided to rub one out before going on a family outing. I'm in the shower, and searching through some videos when my wife walks in. 


She sees I have the phone in the shower and gets mad. Not because she knows what I'm doing, but just thinks I'm wasting time on Reddit when I'm supposed to be getting ready. She opens the shower to take my phone and sees my raging boner. This does not go like it does in the movies I've been watching. She reaches for my phone, and I jerk back to exit the private browser. 


This is where she flips the fuck out. 


Wife starts erupting with all her pregnancy hormones. Throws my phone across the room. Starts screaming about me cheating, and asking who I was talking to. She storms out, and I go after her, still naked and luckily grab a towel. She's still freaking out, and our 3 yo daughter comes in to see what's wrong. 


I have to try to explain to her what happened with my 3 yo there. She doesn't quite believe me. Threatens to cancel family outing which involves my parents and sister. Eventually she calmed down, believed me, and has been making fun of me all day. She's gone to bed now, and I'm on the couch for the night. 


TL;DR I tried to jerk, wife went berserk ",thornhead

I have two monitors, my primary monitor, 1600x900 60hz, my secondary 1366x768 30hz. Whenever my primary monitor has a game in full screen, the second monitor will lag or stutter. It seems to play at like 1 FPS. It just keeps stuttering. If I were to be playing a full screen game on my main, and a video on my left, the video would be stuttering, and makes it nearly impossible to watch videos while playing a game in full screen.

Things I have tried to solve this:

* Installed the newest drivers for my monitor

* Installed the newest drivers for my graphics card (270x)

* Restarting my computer

* Unplugging and plugging in the 2nd monitor

* Changing the Hz on my second Monitor

non_PTSD,"Science seems to have a strong understanding of what happens to physical objects that interact with objects of greater and greater mass (planets and stars).  With enough mass, gravity and the right elements, gravity squeezes hydrogen nuclei so hard that they fuse and become helium.  It seems to me that we know quite well what happens as more and more mass gets added to such a system -- and that as an object is ""nearly"" a black hole there is likely little dispute about what is happening inside the object.  What I don't understand is why does the fact that light can't escape from a black hole result in so many scientists spinning so many crazy-sounding theories about wormholes and people continuing to live?  It seems to me that at the heart of a black hole there is a bunch of mass under a huge amount of pressure. So much pressure as to tear atoms apart and reduce almost everything into their smallest possible components.  A person falling into a black hole would be accelerated by gravity to incredible speeds and then slam into whatever mass constitutes the interior of the black hole.  A hydrogen atom is something like 99.9999999999996% empty space so perhaps gravity at some point is so strong that it squishes atoms  but then what is so special about a bunch of squished atoms?

non_PTSD,"This is an unusual kind of fuckup.

For the last decade or so, I have been trying all the great Chinese restaurants I can locate, in an attempt to find a place that is as awesome as the one I fell in love with 25 years ago in college.  

Over these years I've been going to every different kind of Chinese restaurant I could find, trying to find something as delicious as what made me fall in love in the first place.  I kept track of the different types of sauces, tried to learn how to cook it myself from recipes, and even recently took a Chinese food cooking lesson.

Every time a fancy new Chinese restaurant opened I would be there to taste the food, going from restaurant to restaurant like Prince Charming went door to door looking for a certain foot.

Today, as I was driving down the new street I saw a really crappy looking Chinese place.  One of those in the bad part of town that also sells french fries, is all white, and is really just a takeout place. (Even though there are technically two tables in the place one is covered in magazines and the other has three kids under age 6 coloring because they are stuck there.)
 
When I saw this place I said to myself, I said ""Fuck it, I'm never going to find anything great like they used to make it back in 'my day' and I'm hungry and lazy so I'll just get some of this shitty Chinese and be done with it.""

When I got home and bit into the first dumpling, my dick got a little hard because of 25 years of searching I'd finally found the perfect Chinese food I had been searching for.  

The sauce was just perfect even though it looked so simple . . . hey wait a minute . . . the Chinese place I fell in love with in college must have been a cheap Chinese place that only college students went to.  Thinking back now, it was in a strip mall next to a laundromat.

What happened is that over the years, as my income grew, I slowly went to nicer and nicer Chinese restaurants just by default - whatever I could afford -- and I eventually got used to the fancy ones that grown-ups with spouses and mortgages go to.  

In other words, the reason I couldn't find what I wanted all these years is that I thought I was searching for the best Chinese food when what I really wanted was that same cheap strip-mall Chinese that I fell in love with so many years ago and was dirt poor.  

**TL;DR    ""Current me"" overestimated ""past me"" and I spent ten years trying to find something fancier and more expensive than I ever wanted or needed.**

***UPDATES AFTER THIS HIT THE FRONT PAGE: 
(1) I never heard of the movie Old Boy but will rent it now; (2) There's apparently an episode of HIMYM about a burger that is similar -- I haven't seen that either; (3) Tons of you agree that hole in the wall places are often the best - including a bunch of you in China right now (!!); (4) Many of you think I am probably am in love with MSG.  I am going to order some now from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Ajinomoto-Monosodium-Glutamate-Umami-Seasoning/dp/B00IH28XDE)  and start experimenting with it; (5) Yes the journey was pretty fun but I am glad to have closure now and also to move on to a different obsession, TBD. ***

I am going to play one ""upscale"" round with my dad and wife, and then play one more round with my 9 year old son and dad.  Looking online at various reviews, I am thinking about Mangrove Bay for the upscale round and Seminole Lake Country Club for the round with my son (from their website, they seem to be pretty kid-friendly).

I am a former low handicapper and been hovering in the high 80s for the last few years as my free time decrease with adulthood.  I had back surgery in December and I'm really looking forward to getting back out there with my new body.

Here's what I'm looking for:

For the ""upscale"" round, I would put layout and conditions at the top of my list.  I want to play somewhere lush and nice with decent views if possible.  I don't need a super hard course or something with a ton of blind tee shots that require local knowledge.  The other round I would look for an easy-ish course with few forced carries if possible, but still put a premium on decent conditions.

It makes me feel so weird; like they are crazy.  It feels to me like they are all just suddenly breaking out their spellbooks and pretending to be genies.  They are casually talking about which study rooms their kids go to; just casually talking about ruining the minds of innocent children with false teachings and dedication to a crazed sky fairy out for vengeance. 
But I know this sub exists so I know I'm *not technically* alone; however it feels just as bad.  And now I can't help but thinking...if you think *everyone else* is crazy around you...doesn't that really make you the crazy one?   I just want to run away into another room.  And I *coach their kids* and interact in a very positive way with all these people.  Not today.  Not on Sunday.  Not on an arbitrary positive integer number of solar rotations since the Gregorian monks decided we should track such things.   It's all so strange.  These people around me talking about church as if it's the most natural thing in the world.  Their kids asking each other ""what's *your church* like?  Today I guess it's more acceptable to belong to different churches than to none.   

I guess I'm the crazy one.  It has to be.  *Everyone else* can't be wrong, right?  Why does it feel like *everyone*?  I feel so alone when I'm in situations like this.  Like I, an outgoing, social, gregarious person suddenly has no idea how to act in a social setting.

What should I look at when they are talking about church?  What do I do with my hands?  How do I act so I can not look like a lunatic to them?  How can I pretend to be *normal*?

If mom is not around, or tending to one of the others, I have to take my little girl into the men's room.  So this happened at a quiet little mom & pop restaurant.  It was just the two of us in there.  I wipe off and cover the seat so she can do her little tinkle...but then I realize I really have to go.  No big deal.  I just place her in the corner of the stall and say ""don't move.""
I start to pee.

I hear the door to the restroom open, meaning we are now no longer the only two occupants.  I hear two guys walk in.  As one of the sets of footsteps draw near, my little girl starts to back away from the door and ends up right next to me.  She looks down at what's going on (with an ""open door"" policy on the bathroom at home, and her two brothers...it's nothing she hasn't seen before) and loudly exclaims:  ""Daddy!!  Look at your little penis!!""

What...the...

I hear the other guys in the bathroom kind of snort...and then let loose in laughter.

First of all...wow.  She's never said that before...or since.  Second...WHAT IS HERE FRAME OF REFERENCE!!??  

I didn't know what I could possibly say to make it any better.  I kind of wanted to yell out ""Um..She's just kidding...it's normal size""  but I figured that any remark trying to clarify my size would just come off as creepy.

I had a buddy of mine come over to help me dig out a beach area for my kids to play on.  As you might imagine, digging a beach by hand and wheelbarrowing beach sand down to the shore is back breaking work.  As we were working and talking, I don't remember the exact context, but it was something to the tune of ""Man, this suck at least I have your slave labor working for me"" and after that I started jokingly singing (in a deep voice) ""swing low....sweet chariot....come for to take me home....""

It was at this point I happened to look up and see 3 black guys sitting, fishing, in a rowboat not 25 feet away from me.  We made eye contact...and the older guy just started slowly shaking his head.",DarwinianMonkey

Anyway.  So I was watching my son's soccer game today and just started looking around at the parents and the way that we try to encourage our kids...but then it occurred to me:  how much encouragement is too much?  I'm all for rewarding positive behavior, and I'm also not a fan of punishing every little misstep...however:  goalkeeper lets the ball roll through his legs for a goal and I hear ""good job!"" by almost all the parents.
A player on our team has a wide open shot and whiffs on it, barely contacting the ball....again ""good job!!""

What's up with that?  Why are all these parents telling them good job?  Isn't it basically watering down ACTUAL good jobs?  Why say anything at all?  That's my approach and I don't understand the constant need to reward kids for everything (including bad, wrong, mistaken, or otherwise not ""the right"" behavior).  Kids mess up, sports are hard...so why is it so important to give kids false rewards?  

Also...and this absolutely gives me ulcers...WHY CAN'T I EVEN BRING THIS UP IN CONVERSATION???

I just wanted to talk about this with someone the other day and they acted like I was some kind of monster.  ""In this league, we encourage our kids""
Yeah...I get it.  But shouldn't ""good job"" and ""nice one"" be reserved for ACTUAL good jobs and ACTUAL nice ones?
And again...for those of you who may not have read the first few lines of this:  I am NOT advocating booing or yelling at them or anything like that.  Just stop yelling out GOOD JOB whenever anything happens.  I don't understand it.  This doesn't translate to any other part of life.  You don't tell your kids ""good job"" when she won't go to bed.  You don't tell your kids ""good try"" when they spill their drink on the couch they weren't supposed to drink upon.  Why do it in sports?

non_PTSD,"Just got back from the emergency room.  What a night. 

Some background:  my wife (27) and I (31) have recently gotten into swinging.  It's been a wild and crazy summer for sure, with enough sexual escapades for a lifetime.  She especially has been having a blast, since I'm the only man she's ever even kissed.  

We started out by meeting couples, then got into going to some nice exclusive swinging clubs and private parties.  Tons of fun so far. Only problem is that my erection usually doesn't last for more than 1 to 1.5 hours, but stamina-wise, I can go all night - especially in a club full of beautiful naked women. 

So...I got a little greedy.  I saw a urologist and told him I had erectile dysfunction.  He prescribed various pills, none of which seemed to prolong my hard-on. So the next step was injections straight into the side of the penis.  (I called it Viagra in the post title, but actually it's called TriMix. Same effect though.)  I initially balked at the idea, but after doing some reading on this particular medication (it lasts several hours and makes your cock hard as a diamond), I gave it a second thought. 

So I filled the prescription and decided to give it a try last night.  (To answer a question I'm sure is many readers' minds, no, it's not very painful at all.)  So I got the wife on board for a night of marathon sex, injected myself, and almost instantly got the thickest and hardest erection I've ever experienced.  I almost didn't recognize my dick.  Walking around the house with my massive shlong wagging around was great.  We had a great fuck-fest that had to be cut short, to two hours, only because she was getting sore...and so was I...

...And that's where things got dicey.  I came...twice...and it only got HARDER.  I started pouring cold water over it.  Nothing.  I took four Sudafed pills (as suggested online when you get an out-of-control erection).  Nothing.  I started exercising major muscle groups, doing endless sets of push-ups, pull-ups, squats, etc. (also recommended online, in order to divert the blood).  Nothing.  

Three hours in, it was starting to really hurt...and I was starting to panic.  Knowing that the medication came with a warning that prolonged erections lasting longer than 4 hours require emergency medical attention, I rushed to the ER.  Telling the elderly hispanic woman in triage what happened wasn't fun.  I was writhing in pain at this point, and my cock was so sensitive and painful, I *could not walk and required a wheelchair* because the sensation of it rubbing against my shorts as I walked was incredibly painful.  Yes, I was awkwardly covering up my erection the entire time.  

Eventually I got wheeled into a room.  I got two full doses of morphine before I calmed down a bit.  40 minutes later, a team of doctors and nurses came in.  The resident doctor was a young, cute Indian woman who - unlike the others in the room who tried very hard to act serious - read me and the situation better and made it pretty clear that she thought this was all pretty hilarious and cheered me up immediately, by turns making fun of me and being very vaguely flirtatious. 

Eventually they got a butterfly needle and proceeded to extract a STUPENDOUS amount of blood out of my cock, as the doctors took turns squeezing my dick like a lemon.  Pics of cock, and jar of blood below, obviously NSFW:

http://imgur.com/a/GFyT7

Needless to say, I'll be doing this again, starting at a third of the first dosage.

TL;DR:  wanted to be a sex god by injecting an ED drug directly into my penis, had to rush to the emergency room because it nearly exploded, had to get all the blood drained and squeezed out of my cock.  Good times. 



EDIT:  thank you for the gold, kind stranger. And I'm overwhelmed at all the adulation and admiration for my dick.  Much appreciated. Y'all should have seen it BEFORE it was drained. To clear up a popular misunderstanding though, that is NOT blood covering my dick. It's iodine and lidocaine.  

I'm happy to report that although my dick looks like it's been in a UFC fight (very black and blue from all the squeezing and needles from last night), it feels completely fine, and I've even been getting very hard, spontaneous erections throughout the day today. ",SoreCock

So I hatch the plan with the kids that we should pretend we went to the park but instead hide in the closet to scare Mom instead.  Everyone loved the idea especially since it didnt involve them being freaked out for once.

So we see her pull into the alley and we scramble into the closet and wait.  Im trying to get them to all stop snickering as we hear the garage door close.  Then come the foot steps down the hall...  Her purse hits the desk and we can hear her fumbling around the room.  The dresser drawer opens and in the back of my head a brain cell lights up... But no thats not going to happen... And then it does.  

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and moans start to fill the room.  I look at the puzzled faces of the two innocent ones and the revolting shock of disgust on the 14 year old and did the only thing I could think to do.... ""Hey angel we are in the closet and we were going to scare you.  Coming out in 1 minute.""

We are still trying to process this event.  But needless to say Im still laughing my ass off and she has this sheepish look on her face.  Not sure what we are going to say to the 8 & 9 year old... And I think the 14 year old will never be the same again.

I went to my girlfriend's parents house for dinner for the first time.   Everything was going pretty good until I grabbed a bottle of salad dressing off the table and shook it up. The lid was loose, and it flew off as I was shaking the bottle. Salad dressing spewed all over the fucking dining room. It was everywhere. On the wall, on her Mom's sweater, on the chandelier, on her Dad's hair-everywhere. Everybody sat there in stunned silence, and I reacted (clearly in shock) by saying: ""Unbelievable.

I was shocked to wake up the next morning to the sound of her Dad's footsteps upstairs. I threw my clothes on in record time and tried to run out of the house but that plan did not succeed. I did make it as far as the front door just as her Dad was coming down the stairs. Her Dad is clearly surprised to see me. He slowly says to me: ""Oh, hello Kangar, what are you doing here?""

During one of the first lectures, the professor asked the class a question and I answered. After the class, 'Susan' comes over, introduces herself, and says that she was impressed by my response. Susan then suggests that we should be study partners. Susan is really hot and 27 years old, so I think that this is a fucking awesome suggestion of course. 

Over the next few weeks, I frequently hung out with Susan. One thing led to another and we started to see each other romantically. She was far more sexually experienced than 18 year-old me and I became infatuated with her. There was just one thing though: Susan was living with a guy who was a construction worker from Russia. 

When this first came up, I asked about him of course but she said they were no longer dating and were just living together until she found another place. This was true, however I did not realize how recently they stopped seeing each other. This is where the story gets interesting.

Susan was house-sitting one night for a friend and of course I came to visit. She cooked some dinner, we drank some wine and I played on my new guitar.

I had just bought the guitar the week before.  It was a brand new Fender semi-acoustic. It was ebony black with a cutaway, and it was beautiful. It had been on layaway for about a year, and I had finally just paid it off. Of course I brought it over to the house to try and impress her.  

Suddenly there was a HEAVY knock at the door. This voice with a thick Russian accent yells: ""Susan, I know you're there. OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR RIGHT NOW!!!"" Susan starts freaking out (me as well come to think about it) and tells me that ‘the Russian’ has a really bad temper. Great. 

The banging and yelling continue for several minutes, and then the guy literally smashes his way right through the fucking door. He makes his way towards me. I put my hand on his chest to try and slow him down. I can feel his heart beating out of his chest. He then leaves me alone and starts yelling at Susan.

Right then, I go grab the phone in the next room to call the cops. While I'm on the phone, I hear a very loud crash that I will never forget. I peer around the corner and there is my new guitar-shattered in jagged ebony black pieces all over the floor. The cops show up, listen to what happened and then they say: “Do you want to press charges for the loss of your guitar?” I reply: “God-damn right I do.” 

Susan then starts begging me and crying not to press charges. You need to understand how smitten I was with this woman, so I begrudgingly agreed not to press charges. Why? In a nutshell, because I'm 18 years old and fucking stupid, and I don't want the sex to stop. The cops leave and the Russian leaves. 

Susan moves out the following week and gets her new place. Several weeks later she tells me that the Russian wants to meet with me. I say:'OK,' because I wanted to ask him to pay for my guitar. We meet at a busy bar, just the two of us, and we both order a beer. 

Turns out he was a pretty nice guy and wanted to apologize. I say:” Well I appreciate that, but you really have to pay for my guitar.” The Russian looks at me coolly and says:” You lost your guitar-I lost my woman. We’re even.” This caveman logic of his actually resonated with me somehow so I said nothing. 

I finished my beer and left the bar. Never saw the guy again. Dated Susan for about a year and then she dumped me. Learned a lot that year.

non_PTSD,"My grandfather kept a stack of nudie books in the desk in the basement. When we visited my grandparents, my sister and I would pore through them all. We could sense that it was some taboo shit that we were looking at, but I was 11, and my sister was 12, and this was well before the internet.  We knew jack-shit about the world of sex, so most of the magazine content went over our heads.

The thing was, I loved comics, and the Playboys were loaded with them. There were lots of the one-panel variety, and multi-page comics like Little Annie Fanny.

When I’d exhausted the Playboys, I decided to have a deeper look at the Penthouse magazine. There was only one of those, and I'd already looked at it once before, but I didn't like their comics as much as I did with the Playboys.  I drifted over to other parts of the magazine, and I found the Penthouse Forum letters.

These were letters that described the crazy sexual escapades that real people were having out there, all slavishly documented. It was the greatest fucking thing since comic books for me. I became immersed in these lurid and unfathomable sexual activities, and I was delighted, shocked and grossed out. Now and then I would pause, and reflect on why my parents had not explained these kinds of intimacies with me when they covered the sex talk.

Oh, and there was one letter about nose-fucking. The letter was from a man who described an incident of being fellated by his girlfriend one evening.  As he is mouth-fucking her, he accidentally goes into one of her nostrils with his cock. He describes being a little freaked out by this, and then he gets really turned on. His girlfriend gets turned on too, and he ends up ejaculating in her nose. 

I just about hit the fucking roof after reading this letter.  This is sensory overload for 11-year old me, and I don't know whether to shit or go blind.  Looking back now, it felt like my novice sexual brain had burst into awareness of itself, and I remember the feeling vividly.  

in addition to being mildly aroused by the tale, it fucking stayed in my psyche for a good long while. Years later when I hit puberty and started getting interested in girls, I would think of that letter now and again.  Sometimes I'd be checking out a girl, and I'd think: “Could I marry a girl with a nose like that? What would it be like to ejaculate in **her** nose?” ""Had her parents told her about nose-fucking?""  Thoughts like that.

My grandfather eventually caught us reading his porn stash and he was pissed off. He took the magazines away, and that was that. Interestingly, the whole nose thing never became a fetish of mine (hey, there’s still time), but every now and then, I’ll look at a girl’s nose, think of that letter to Penthouse Forum, and I am 11-years old again.

* Elevation Gain: 2,253 ft
* Min Elevation: 80 ft
* Max Elevation: 906 ft

Does anyone have any recommendations for preparation?

A little background on me:

* I got back into running a couple months ago after a five-year hiatus. I've been running between three and six miles twice a week with a per-mile pace that varies between 7:30 and 9:00.

* I hurt my knees and ankles training for another half marathon five years ago. I think I just overdid it - I was going from 5K to the half marathon in 10 days. I've done a lot of strength training in the intervening years, and feel much stronger now, but I want to be somewhat cautious this time around.

* I bike to work almost every day. It's a ten-mile round trip. I don't have much alternative, as my family only has one car and my wife needs it most days.

non_PTSD,"I'm an American who was living in Poland at the time of this fuck up. I've always been a big fan of going to the movies and I *love* popcorn. The one thing that always bothered me about European movie theaters, though, is that they don't give you butter on your popcorn. You can order it sweet or salty, but not greasy.

My wife's cousins had traveled to my city to visit ([somehow they are always around for my fuck ups!](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2ix5ss/tifu_by_being_overenthusiastic_about_my_salad_in/)), and we decided to go see a movie. I was talking about the superiority of American popcorn and they were making the predictable ""fat American"" jokes about our cultural need to pour fat on everything. We were going back and forth, and I got so worked up in my patriotic fervor that I told them I would bring my own butter to the movies to demonstrate how great it was. I melt a stick of butter in the microwave, pour it into a glass jar, put the jar into the pocket of my peacoat, and we head to the movies.

It was the dead of Polish winter, and it took us quite some time to take the trams to the theater. By the time we get there, the butter had congealed to a semi-solid that was glued to the bottom of the jar. No problem, we buy a large popcorn and my cousin holds it while waiting for me outside the men's room. I go into one of the stalls, hold the jar by the rim, and strike my lighter underneath it. Unfortunately, the lighter made quite a distinct sound, and people in the bathroom heard it. The gap in the stall door frame was quite wide, and a couple of people shot glances my way. I'm not sure what they think they saw, but it must have been weird to see a guy with a lighter under a glass. I heard whispers about ""narkotyki"" and started to get nervous. Was security about to get called on me for suspected crack smoking? 

Fortunately, the butter melted quite quickly and I decided to make a run for it. *Unfortunately*, the jar was way too hot to hold anywhere except by the rim. So I did the only thing I could think of, which was to hold the jar in front of me by the rim and briskly walk out of the bathroom before my fingers burned. The crowd parted wide for me as I half-ran through the bathroom holding a mysterious jar of yellow liquid. People were equally stunned outside the bathroom when I emerged. An entire theater was emptying out in front of me, and all they saw was a frantic-looking man running out of a bathroom and hurriedly dumping a jar of yellow fluid into a popcorn bag held by an embarrassed-looking accomplice. There were several pronounced looks of disgust.

I can't say that I kept my head held high after that, but I can say that I enjoyed the hell out of that buttered popcorn while watching that movie. Good times. I still love popcorn, but these days I'm more into olive oil and nutritional yeast than butter.

**BACKGROUND**: I've been lifting for about two years, but only last month began doing a program. I'm doing SL with a few extras added on. The only real change I've made is that I squat once every other visit, rather than each time. I've had knee and ankle joint problems for years, and squatting three times a week always leaves me feeling worn out and close to injury.

To compensate for the lack of squats on my B day, I decided to do more deadlifts. The original program only calls for me to deadlift 5x1, which seems too low. I was deadlifting 5x5, but after a few visits felt like I was overdoing it. I'm now considering 5x3. I would love some helpful suggestions on this or other possible alternatives.

This one (万) means 'man,' and this one (女) means 'woman.' Basically, I'm trying to describe how all of us exist on a gender continuum between the two and integrate parts of both into our identities to different degrees.""

I responded, ""Actually, Japanese characters (kanji) and Chinese characters (hanzi) are really the same thing. And I don't think that one (万) means 'man.' It actually means 'ten thousand.'

I look up and this poor girl is literally in tears. The entire party had come to a standstill as I pompously embarrassed this kid in front of all her friends. She had had the tattoo done two or three years earlier and no one had ever caught it.

I'm now basically doing SL (though only squatting every other time and including 5x5 deadlifts, 5x5 weighted dips, 5x5 weighted pull-ups, and 5x5 bicep hammer curls).

My problem is that previously I had been benching until my elbows were 90° rather than taking the bar all the way to my chest. I'm now going down all the way, and my lifts have plummeted. Where before I was able to do 225 x5 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3, last time I did 190 x 5 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 3. Seems like I'll need to deload again, which has got me feeling pretty bummed.

Any advice/encouragement? Thanks, y'all.",Oakland_Facet

non_PTSD,"I've been deadlifting for about six months and taking it very slow because of my back, which has been injured in more car accidents than I care to remember. My current routine is:

135 lb x 12 (warmup)

90 sec rest

225 lb x 8 (always make it)

90 sec rest

225 lb x 8 (usually fail at 6)

90 sec rest

225 lb x 8 (usually fail at 6

I do this three times a week. However, I was recently reading about stronglifts, and was surprised to see that the 5x5 program calls for only one set of five reps, and only once every four or five days. That made me question how often and how many reps I am currently doing. I would love to hear people's advice.

One important note: I am not currently squatting, which I know uses may of the same muscle groups as deadlifting. Every time I try to get into squats my bad knee gives me trouble. I've been told I have decent form, too. I would like to take up squatting again soon.

non_PTSD,"Please help me, scientifically literate people of Fittit! I'm a public health nutritionist who can tell you a lot about diet and exercise on a population level, but is definitely not an expert on sports nutrition. Professionally, I'm a big believer that good health can (and probably *should*) be achieved through diet and exercise - no supplementation necessary. However, as I've gotten more into lifting, I've started to consider supplementing with whey protein. Can anyone point me in the direction of **good, published research** showing the benefits of protein supplementation for people doing amateur strength training? **I'm not interested in one-off studies**, either; I'd love a meta-analysis, review article, or position paper by government body or reputable professional organization.

So far the best I've found has been:

Quick background on me for relevance: Male, 32 y/o, 5'7"" (1.71 m), 170 lb (77 kg). Been lifting for about 18 months. I bench 215 lb x 5 and deadlift 225 lb x 8 (taking it slow because of a bad back). I lift for about an hour three times a week. Otherwise, desk job, though I try to bicycle commute (10 miles round trip) about three times a week. I'd like to make greater gains, but I'm still skeptical that protein (or other) supplementation will make much of a difference.

non_PTSD,"I lift at a pretty small gym and I'm often in a hurry trying to get my sets in before I have to rush to daycare to pick up the kids ($5 per minute late charge will motivate you!). The gym has only one bench, so if someone is on it when I'm ready, I will usually very politely ask to work in after his next set. 9/10 times the person is chill, but sometimes (like tonight), someone is like ""I'll be off in five minutes."" Maybe I'm in too much of a rush, but five minutes is too fucking long to not share equipment that is easily shared. When someone says ""I only have one set left and then it's all yours,"" I'm totally good with that, but anything longer and I get pissed. Let me know if you think I'm out of line.

I've had a bad back in the past (more car collisions than I care to remember) so I've been increasing the weight *very* gradually since I started six months ago. Once I got up to 225 I found that my lower back was aching in a way that didn't feel quite right, so I'm trying to improve my form before adding more weight. To avoid rounding my back or doing too much of a squat, today I tried lowering the plates until they were about four inches above the floor, rather than making contact. It felt much more natural and smooth. Is there a potential downside to this that I should know about?

For background, I currently deadlift:

135 x 12, 225 x 8, 225 x 6, 225 x 5

non_PTSD,"Here's a thought experiment for all the male redditors out there who have watched the street harassment videos going around and are reacting by saying, ""A lot of those men were just offering a polite compliment! What's the problem?""

Imagine yourself in a context where you feel less safe and less privileged. Imagine that you are, for example, a new inmate in prison. Imagine that everywhere you walk, men larger than you are telling you that you're beautiful or that you should smile for them or are giving you the twice-over look and wishing you a good morning or saying ""God bless you, papi."" Some of them are just messing with you, some of them are just offering a polite comment, some of them are hoping for a consensual relationship with you, and a few of them are after something scarier.

But in an environment like that, where you are aware of your own vulnerability to humiliation and assault, can you honestly tell yourself that it wouldn't be harassing and frightening? That you should just smile at the ""nice"" comments and ignore the bad? I sure can't say that.

And to anticipate some commentary, yes, I know that prison is different than the streets. But it occurs to me that prison is one of the few environments where men can feel the sexual vulnerability that women outside of prison often feel. BTW, sexual assault prevalence for men in prison is about the same as for women outside. Which says damning things about our society in several different ways.",Oakland_Facet

non_PTSD,"Back in 2009, I picked up my wife's cousin from the JFK airport. He had just arrived from Warsaw to study acting in NYC. We were really close friends from my days living in Poland the previous year, and I was excited to be able to host him on my side of the Atlantic.

We decided to spend an evening hanging out in the city before going back to my place in New Jersey, where my wife and infant daughter were waiting. He had never been to the U.S. as an adult, and I wanted to show him a good time. First stop: pizza.

I took him to the best place I knew, a Napolitano joint in Soho that serves authentic D.O.C. pies that had completely blown me away every time I had tried them previously. My little brother was in the neighborhood and swung by to join us. He arrived just as our table was ready.

By this time the sun had set. This restaurant's vibe was typical for New York at that time: dim lighting and loud music. I had to hold the menu up to my face to read it. We went for a couple of salads and a Margherita. The salads came in large serving bowls. We nibbled a little, and then the pizza arrived. I'm a true believer that you have to eat the pizza as soon as it comes out of the oven, so we left the salads and dug in. It was sublime. Crusty crust, amazing buffalo mozzarella, rich tomato sauce with olive oil drizzled over, and fresh basil. 

After the pie, I set back to work on my salad, serving myself a couple of scoops from the bowl. It was the first time my brother had met my wife's cousin, so I was kind of playing host, holding court at the table while eating off my plate. I remember absentmindedly trying to cut a pepperoncino that my salad knife didn't seem to be able to bite into. So, being the lusty eater I am, I grabbed the pepper by the stalk, threw the whole thing in my mouth, and gave it a big chomp. It was weird though, the pepper didn't pop. I gave it another chomp before I realized something was wrong. I pulled it out of my mouth saying, ""What the hell?"" Then I held it up to my face and tried to make out what it was. ""Oh no, oh no,"" I started mumbling. The conversation ground to a halt. 

The ""pepper"" had four little gray legs coming off of it, with four little pink pads on four little pink paws. The ""stalk"" was a long, gray tail. It was a mouse. A dead mouse, which had not only been in my salad all meal long, but which I had actually grabbed by the tail, thrown in my mouth, and chomped down upon. Twice.

I ran, not walked, to the waiter, told him we had a serious fucking problem at our table, and then ran into the bathroom to throw up.

non_PTSD,"Okay, time for some background and disclosure. My Biology teacher (we'll call her ""Kate""), is hot. I don't mean this in a ""I want to have sex with her"" way, but rather a ""I'd like to unzip her genes"" way (yes, I got that off the internet). Either way, she has been at the school for five years, and in that time the school has come to an informal consensus that her Ass should be the mark to which other Asses are compared. For example, if me and my friends are checking some girl out, we'd say ""Not as good as Kate's, but not bad either"". This leads us to today.

My Biology teacher (who is awesome), had previously told us that she liked to matchmake within her classes, and I decided to take my chances in getting in a class with the hottest girl in my grade (we're juniors). As such, I walked up to my Biology teacher, and casually asked if next semester she could pair us together (I'm really sleep-deprived from finals, so my inhibition is turned off). At this, she smiled and said ""you think she's attractive don't you"". This is where I fucked up. I, without looking at my teacher and mistaking this casual conversation with those that I have with my friends, said ""Well her Ass isn't Kate good, but it's...."" At this, she raised her eyebrow and smiled a bit at my embarrassment, and then turned and walked away. I have Bio tomorrow, and don't know how I can face her again.

Tl;dr My Bio teacher's ass is the informal benchmark at my school for a good ass. Accidentally let it slip in a conversation with her that I thought my classmate's ass was almost at her level.

Edit: Not going to share photo of Teacher's ass. Don't want identification. However, this is roughly equivalent (except blonde and white pants) http://i.imgur.com/7KtTI.jpg

Hello again Reddit. It's been 3 ish months since my last post about this and my inbox is having a slow death. Quite a bit has actually happened in the past few months. I messaged the mods who gave me their blessing to post a final update. So this is it... stop PM'ing me.

We shall refer to my gf as ""Megan"" and her sister as ""Amy"".

(January)

After Thanksgiving Amy stopped talking with us entirely. We tried calling, texting, we even went to her apartment and were told she had moved out about a week earlier by her ex-neighbors. Megan asked her parents if they had heard from her and they said that Amy visited saying she was moving to another state (East Coast). Her parents were surprised we didn't know about it and proceeded to ask a lot of questions that we dodged around trying to keep them out of the whole mess.

Megan used her parents phone to call Amy, she picked up and immediately hung up right after she heard Megan's voice. I told Megan she just needed to give it some time and let everyone cool off until things got better.

(February)

Amy called Megan. I wasn't home when the call happened (work) but the conversation was not productive according to Megan. Amy called saying she wanted Megan to know how sorry she was and she didn't mean for this whole situation to be so screwy. Megan told her it was all water under the bridge, she wasn't mad anymore, understood you can't control feelings, I'm a bit of a doofus, you get the point. Amy didn't buy it and admitted she still has some feelings for me, which proceeded with Megan getting really pissed off. Amy getting upset because Megan said it was all fine but apparently it isn't. Amy hangs up. Megan vents to me about how she could still have feelings for me. I was a little pissed at the time as well, but as we all know. Getting over a crush is a lot easier said than done. Megan realized her mistake of blowing up at her, tried calling over and over with no avail.

(End of February)

I got engaged Reddit! This may seem like horrible timing, but Megan and I have discussed marriage previously (Even before this debacle). It was our 4 year anniversary since dating and I could tell she wanted me to propose. (Baby talk, looking for a house, subtle stuff). As you can guess, she said yes! Her parents had given me their blessing and we asked them to call Amy and tell her for us. (Her parents are well aware that we aren't on speaking terms they understand us not saying what about). They did and we didn't get a call or anything from Amy.

(Two Days Ago)

Amy showed up at our door. Tears were shed, many apologizes, congratulation's on the engagement. I excused myself to let them talk, however I'd be lying if I didn't say I wasn't eavesdropping a tiny bit. Short style: Amy has a boyfriend now, got a really nice job out on the East, would like to come to our wedding. Of course Megan and I are extremely happy this whole mess is mostly sorted out. (Was a little awkward talking to both of them together). I'm sure there will be a running sexting joke among us for a while

**Tl;Dr: Amy moved, didn't talk for a month, Megan and Amy talk and get even more angry, I propose/got engaged, Amy comes back, we all made up, wedding soon^TM . Stop PM'ing me please**

Edit 2: Obligatory front page excitement. Also to those pm'ing me, thank you for the kind words on my engagement. To those sending me videos of three some incest... it's still not going to happen.

Edit 3: To those asking for a wedding update, no. I promised mods I wouldn't post anymore about this. Plus it's months away and there's really no need. If anything I'll just make another edit on this post whenever the wedding happens and let you guys know.

Latest Update: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2z6b65/tifupdate_by_sexting_my_girlfriends_sister_and/

Now to what happened on Thanksgiving. 

So my gf's sister showed up Wednesday afternoon and everything was going perfectly fine throughout the day. I left around 4 ish to grab some beer and wine before Thanksgiving. When I came home I could hear yelling from the front door and when I walked in it only intensified. My gf and her sister were in full fledged fuck you mode. Once I walked through the door, they both stopped yelling, and the sister went upstairs. I asked what it was about and it was about the sexting incident again. I got them both together and asked them to just play it off until Thanksgiving was over and we could talk the day after.

Thanksgiving happens, there was a lot of tension in the air but my gf and her sister played it off pretty well, nothing too suspicious. Her parents don't expect anything and they left all good.

Literally 5 minutes after they left, the house exploded. My girlfriend was yelling at her sister for ""Eyeing"" me all evening. I genuinely didn't notice, but I am somewhat flattered. I told them to calm down and they both told me to fuck off basically and I ended up sleeping on the coach last night.

Now here I am about 20 hours after being banished to the coach. My girlfriends sister left in the morning didn't say good bye just left a note saying she wouldn't be talking to us anymore and to enjoy Christmas without her. My gf proceeded to break down into tears and blame me for all this. We talked about an hour ago and it's better now between us. But I'm pretty sure I broke two sisters apart.

Update 2: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2z6b65/tifupdate_by_sexting_my_girlfriends_sister_and/

Little back story, I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 4 years now and would never cheat on her. We have a very intimate relationship and live together. I am very close with her family, who like me a lot. I naturally have her father, mother and sisters phone number.

We have been planning Thanksgiving dinner for the past few days (We switch off every year with her and my family) with her family on where to have it, I've been out of town for the past week for work and have been communicating through text with her and her family. This is where everything went wrong.


I was texting my girlfriend and her sister. I was texting her sister about her staying out our place after dinner (She didn't want to pay for a cab back would be $100+). Meanwhile my gf starts sexting me from home. Giving me some NSFW pics and dirty messages. I am responding back and forth. She asks me ""Show me what you've go right now"". Right as I read that I got a call (Work stuff) and have to take care of that really quick. Mid-way through the call my gf's sister texts me back about staying after thanksgiving. In my horny rage I didn't notice she had responded, I just took a picture of my dick, clicked the first option on my phone and sent the pic saying ""You think you can handle this?"" About two minutes later her sister texts me back ""I've been wanting it for the longest time"". Needless to say, my response to her wasn't what she wanted to hear, and my girlfriend is pissed. Thanksgiving should be fun!

Tl;Dr: Was sexting my girlfriend, got a call from work, mid-way through call gf's sister texts me, I don't notice and send her a pic of my dick, she says she wants to bang. Thanksgiving is going to be a blast.

*For all of you asking. My girlfriend is the hotter sister.*

Edit 1: People asking if I told my gf. Yes I did, she was angry but understood it was a mistake and I didn't mean it. She's more upset at her sister.

Edit 2: To those asking if her parents know about this. No they do not, we are going to see them next weekend though and we're going to tell them then. I don't like secrets.

Edit 3: You guys seem very on the side of don't tell the parents. This isn't my choice just so you know, I am completely leaving this up to her. She said she wants to because she wants this out in the air. I told her we could do that with just us 3 talking. I'll let you guys know how that conversation goes.

**Edit 4: She has decided to not tell her parents** after your guys comments. Rest assured this will stay between the 3 of us.

Edit 5: To those of you asking ""Why did you tell your gf in the first place?"" You've never been in a long-lasting relationship. Secrets are basically non-existent, honesty is the best thing. In retrospect could I have kept this a secret? Maybe, but I'm not willing to take the chance of her finding out down the line and being upset with me and losing her. 

Edit 6: Front page! Girlfriend is happy this experience happened now. You'll all be mentioned at the wedding!

Edit 7: A lot of people giving me shit for telling my girlfriend. Calm down people, I handle something one way, you can handle it another. You never know what you'll do until it happens.

**Edit 8: For those wondering how the conversation went between my girlfriend and her sister**. Its as awkward as you can imagine. To the sisters credit she confessed that she actually is attracted to me and apologized for responding. I apologized for not looking who I sent it to. My gf and her talked privately for a while (I left the room). All seems well they hugged and she's staying for thanksgiving... she's on close surveillance though.",Gregorianchant1

 I would love to see some Growth on the back story of the F.E.V we know it started out as a way to combat possible Chinese Biological warfare and if done correctly could boost not only your strength , stamina, endurance etc by 100% but also boost your intelligence by 200%, i would like to see a group that has has taken the F.E.V and done some new stuff with it instead of a story line like Vault 87 or just having remnants of the masters army. I just thought it would be killer to see someone prefect it and make a person stronger/faster/smarter without the hideous mutations it brings or maybe do away with the sterility side effect.(future mutant playable character?) 


 Real Consequences to not Checking radiation. This is a easy one we know in some cases people can be turned into a ghoul threw radiation, I honestly hope if you cant find rad away fast enough you start to see goulfication on your player.



Some kind of a nod to Harold. Finding Harold for me in fallout 3 came so late in my play threw it was just amazing to find him and i really was geeking out he is the only (person ? ) to be in all 3 games and now that he is stuck in D.C I am a little disappointed that there is not really a feasible way to see him again. However maybe he lost some seeds in a far corner of our new map and now has some sort of standing legend as a wandering giver of life lol.



Pre war tale to follow. The Keller Family transcripts in FO3 were pretty awesome to randomly find and eventually you find them in the and learn what happened to them, and depending on how determined you were to not turn to the internet for help finding them you could be pretty invested into their story and uncovering what happened to them. The way i see it is your live in this small community and have neighbors that obviously aren't going to make it into the vault with you it would be cool to explore a little bit before the bombs drop and maybe over hear someone talking about their plan for ensuring their family survives and then exploring how that played out for them when you wake up and who knows maybe it can take you on a long side quest to find their bunker as well.



 respawning caravans. In FO3 if you wanted to you could fairly easily figure out the traders route and i myself always had fun doing a raider play threw but the problem was all the trade caravans were unique so once you ambushed them they were gone. I would love to see a more realistic approach to this, Raid caravans to much and they will plan for you with A.Going around that area or B. Coming with more armed guards. 


.Aliens. I want to see them more they have a interesting interest in our world and i would love to see it expended on i just hope they stay away from the whole they had the launch codes did they start the war stuff. Its just to cool running around with alien tech and i hope this game doesn't fail to impress us with How/what we find this time around. Btw was i the only one that got chills reading the ufo reports in the pentagon in FO3? I loved it .



 Untouched  vault, rather it be active and currently running its experiment ( highly preferred ) or just untouched by the wasteland i just crave to find one maybe even use it as a base for awhile. Maybe the vault 111 will fit this bill obviously we wont know for 17 days lol.


 Who dropped the first bomb. Seems like a trivial detail to some but i want to know exactly what happened that set in motion the event that triggered the great war.

Info on the current state of other countries. Is new Zealand untouched? did it get flooded due to fossil fuels induced climate change, what about Australia or Africa country's that most likely wouldn't see bombs dropped on them. 



 Battle at bunker hill 2. i would be shocked if this didn't happen but bunker hill hosted one of the bloodiest battles that transpired in the american civil war and i want to see a war happen the likes we have ever seen a game ever to date.

non_PTSD,"Alright reddit, this actually happened today, four hours ago to be exact.
I'm 28 years old and have a girlfriend. We have been together for about three years now and things are (were?) going okay. We aren't officially living together, but most of the nights she sleeps over at my place. 
So after we had dinner I was watching some Seinfeld on my laptop sitting on the couch when she drops herself besides me. She tells me she is bored and that she wants to do something. Okay then, I ask her what she was thinking about doing then, not really paying attention since it was the answering machine episode and George's song was coming up. She says ""Oh I dunno haha, we could watch porn together, that would be fun right?"". So now she got my attention and I could tell this wasn't something she just came up with on the spot organically, she sounded excited and I could tell the whole ""I'm bored"" thing was just a playful act to do some bf/gf stuff. ""Well, okay why not"", I tell her. Alright then!, she is all energetic and she jumps beside me on the couch in a playful manner smiling and all jumpy, cuddling besides me. 

I don't actually think she normally watches porn herself. Obviously the reason she wanted to watch porn with me in the first place was the same reason you watch a bad horror movie together, to laugh and make comments on everything that's happening, you know, you watch it in a ironic way I guess. Watching some cheesy porn scene and making comments on how absurd the premise is, some funny zingers about the setting and maybe sexy talk, you know, good stuff. I should have put on a lengthy cheesy porn flick or something. This is very obvious to me right now, typing this; Two hours ago, this was NOT that obvious. This is where the fuckup starts. I have never. cringed this hard while typing something.

So here I am, laptop on my lap and my girlfriend next to me on the couch, looking at the screen. I pause the seinfeld episode and open a new tab in the browser. ""Sooo, what do you want to watch"", I asked her. 
  ""Well I don't know haha, you are the expert here right?"". ""just do what you normally do haha"".
What the fuck woman. Obviously there is no way she is going to be invited to witness the dark ritual that is my pornwatching. Oh sure, let's first watch some hardcore porn GIFS on an obscure subreddit whose url I know by heart to then proceed to xvideos to watch a video of a dominatrix cum in the mouth of a woman. Good idea, Fun times /s. 

So now, I start to panic a little bit. ""Okay then. Let's see here.."" I am not going to screw this up. I slowly type xhamster.com in the urlbar, because, in that moment for some reason I was certain that xhamster was the most normal porn website I could choose. What the fuck brain. I press enter and the website is coming up. I can notice she looks closer at the screen, like she misread the name of the site the first time. So the website is loaded and we are looking at the homepage. We were going to watch something extremely vanilla or I would die trying.

My mind is going bezerk: Okay, no lesbian stuff obviously. No anal/DP, I don't want her to think I would like to try that with her. No threesome porn. No facial stuff, she might think I'm a perv. No mentions of milfs/teens/girls/specific race of course.. 

I am staring at this homepage without scrolling and I can feel that she is kinda weirded out. I just can't decide what video to click on. I decide to use the search function. I type the most normal phrase I could think of: ""Big tit has sex with man"" What in the flying fuck brain!? ""Big tit has sex with man"". I can hear her reading it. Holy shit this is bad.  For some stupid reason I didn't feel that I could just tell her it was a mistake or make a joke out of it. No fun comments. Just me, looking at the screen silently and dead serious waiting for the page to load completely, focused to make sure that I don't click on something weird. So I click on a video in the list that had what I thought was a pretty normal thumbnail. It turned out to be some shaky homemade amateur videotape of a married couple having sex in what I guess was their trailerhome. I was staring at the screen with a complete pokerface, with my two hands on the keyboard. I could feel her judging me. The atmosphere was really weird. What could I say? Should I turn the video off? What was she thinking? Why wasn't she saying anything? The video finally ends and I ask her if she wants to watch in bed. ^wtfbrain. She says, ""well I think I'm gonna head home actually"". She left.
No I'm here in bed all alone typing this story. Should I call/text her? I really fucked up here, I really wen't full retard.

Cliffs: GF wanted to watch porn with me, screwed it up because I didn't want to watching something weird, ended up watching something extremely weird. GF left.


**UPDATE:** Hey guys. Wow, I really didn't except this to blew up like it did. I want to thank you all for your kind words and pieces of advice. I called her up the next day, explained what went through my head like you guys adviced me to and I guess she understood my ""struggle"" and everything is fine now. 

A friend of mine gave me this cool advice to watch Taxi Driver with her, since in that movie there is a scene where Robert Deniro's character awkwardly  takes a girl to a porn theatre for their first date. We might watch that later tonight, maybe that scene will start a conversation about how weird and, in hindsight, how humerous that night was. 

Thanks again for the advice and I'd like to wish you all a happy New Year!

non_PTSD,"[Here is my previous post.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2fc62m/tifu_by_letting_my_boyfriend_finger_me/)

Don't continue reading if you want to keep the menstrual magic alive. 

I have been cackling at the responses to my earlier thread for most of the past 18 hours. I was a little too shy to respond to individual comments, so I am just going to answer many questions at once. Here is some long-winded background information that will not be of interest many:

I thought I'd die of TSS too, but turns out I was totally fine. I guess it just smelled like I had been dead for weeks. I must have an iron vagina. I didn't use my menstrual cup again after that, half to help cure my boyfriend's PTSD and half because it had the lingering stench of eviscerated bodies. That he enjoys eating me out again is probably proof that he's better now, so there's hope for the ladies who have fucked up like me. 

I have a few reasons why my cup was left in so long. 

- My boyfriend was away for part of that time, and when he returned, I let him know I was on my period and so we delayed sex. I sort of was on my period, too - the hole in the bottom of my menstrual cup had been leaking small amounts of foul brown fluid starting about 24 hours after I had put it in. I had chalked it up to crazy hormones. By the time it was the last night, I decided to try having sex anyways in the hopes that the flow had faded out and my two-week ""period"" had ended. 

- The cup I selected is actually was a pretty small one, because I have a small frame and hadn't given birth. It was comfortable to the point where I didn't feel it. I had accidentally trimmed the poky stem on the bottom with scissors to be too short, so it would sometimes take me 10 minutes/broken nail to take out the small cup. This inconvenience which is why I ignorantly requested my boyfriend's aid in removing it. 

- I generally don't put my fingers inside myself, but if I had, I wouldn't have been able to reach the bottom of the cup very easily anyways. 

- As a matter of fact, I come from a distinguished line of stupid. Seriously, my family has a genetic history of forgetfulness. Not that it can excuse pungent brown uterine broccoli, but maybe it can help you understand. I was the kind of kid whose parents forgot her often and the kind of woman who frequently lost things. If you are like me, I recommend a lanyard and a well-updated calendar. Not quite Alzheimers, but that runs in the family too. Go figure. 

My transitions from outdoors to indoors to bathroom happened a little quickly for some in my abbreviated post. Let me put it in sequence for you. 
1. While we are outdoors, boyfriend scents the sewage stench. Instinctively, boyfriend runs to the bathroom in my house, (even though we are wild deer and the forest is also our bathroom.)
2. I freak out, and throw my disgusting menstrual cup and fluid into the bushes. Which was actually a great idea, since it meant the smell didn't get all over my house.
3. I wash the nasty off my thighs. I take about 2 minutes to soap everything down. He returns to the bathroom to wash his hands again.
4. Massive queef-tastrophe - just when he thinks he's clean, my vagina explodes. The brown chunks that miss his leg splatter onto the floor then bounce back onto and under his feet.
5. He washes up briefly and goes home, apologizing. I don't blame him at all.
6. We had a fond farewell the next afternoon, but did not bring up the incident for months. We briefly laughed about it a few months later, but haven't talked about it in a very long time. Perhaps ironically, I had forgotten about it too until yesterday.

This actually happened a while ago. We are still together. He is a keeper. Moral of the story: Life can be gross sometimes, especially if you leave your menstrual cup in for 14 days. But at least I turned my pain into something beautiful.

I'll let you guys know when my novel gets published. Here's hoping broccoli owners and menstrual cup companies everywhere don't send me too much hate mail. If you puked/spilled on anything electronic, try putting it in rice for a while. ",uteruinestench
non_PTSD,"EDIT: [Update here.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2feoep/tifupdate_tifu_by_letting_my_boyfriend_finger_me/)

It was supposed to be romantic. It was our last night together before he left on a plane, not to see me for months, and we were about to get groovy.

We were under the stars, kissing and holding each other and spending a long time on the perfect foreplay. It was fucking amazing. We were ready to fuck like animals and to make sweet love all at once.

We were naked and touching each other to build up suspense, and he began to finger me hard, leaving me moaning, but with an... odd... sensation as well.

   ""There's something inside you,"" he said.

   ""There's nothing, don't stop,"" I replied, uneasily. 

   ""No, there's something inside you. It feels plastic.""

Horror chills my veins. It had been about two weeks since my period. But I knew then that I had left my menstrual cup (basically a plastic cup for blood/period gunk not to be left in longer than 12 hours) in for the past *14 days.* 

IDIOTICALLY, I asked him to help me remove it so we could continue. MOTHER OF GOD... it smelled like an eviscerated decomposing body mixed with rotting broccoli, sewage, and rotting eggs ALL IN ONE. And the smell DID NOT GO AWAY. I threw out the cup and its contents, but the stench of 14 day old rotting blood and uterine gunk is not one that fades easily. I could tell my squeamish boyfriend was trying extremely hard not to lose his shit and vomit. But it only got worse from there.

The stench would not leave, and it was coming from my vagina. To try and bring the mood back, I went to the bathroom to try and freshen up. He joined me, perhaps to make me feel less disgusting. Bad idea. With a feeling like an impending queef but somehow *thicker*, my vagina suddenly emptied a massive glob of this filth and it splattered a surprisingly large amount of brown rotted uterine filth all over my poor boyfriend's leg... He practically ran home.


",uteruinestench
non_PTSD,"I have been playing a subtle and what I thought harmless prank on one of my co-workers for the last four and a half years. 

This guy, let's give him a fake name of Reginald, is a bit of an oddball, but a good dude. He is very quiet and polite, kind of keeps to himself, but sometimes comes up with random and hilarious one-liners out of nowhere. I like him. 

About four and a half years ago I did this prank for the first time. He always has a post-it note pad on his desk. I turned to a post-it note a few pages (is 'pages' the right word?) back and wrote the word ""Fart!"" on the post-it. A few days later he got to that post-it note, saw the word, stared at it for a few seconds, and said out loud to himself ""...What!?"" He then quickly removed that post-it, ripped it into three pieces, and threw it in the trash.

So, I have done this about once every two weeks for the last four and a half years. I can't even count how many times I have done. But literally every single time I see him find the post-it he does the EXACT same thing. In the same exact tone of voice, to himself, he says ""...What!?"" And then every single time he always rips it into THREE pieces and throws it away.

Nobody else has ever seen the post-it. He has never told anyone, as far as I know. He just, every time, almost as if he is seeing it the first time, says ""...What!?"" and rips it into three pieces.

I kind of became obsessed with this. I just waned to see if he'd ever do something different.

Well, today, he did. I saw him write a post-it note, pull it off the pad, and thereby revealed the post-it I'd written ""Fart!"" on. 

This time, it was different. He stared at it in silence for a solid five minutes. Suddenly, he SHOUTED. This crazy primal roar sort of a shout. He picked up his computer monitor and slammed it into the floor. He held up the post-it note pad and screamed ""WHO IS DOING THIS!?!"" 

Everyone stared at him in shock, myself included. Nobody said a word. After a moment he ran out of the office.

I am mortified and full of shame. I thought it was a harmless prank but apparently it had been really bothering him for the past few years and he just snapped. 

I want to apologize in person, but I won't, because I refuse to take responsibility. I don't want people to think negatively of me. I think I will apologize anonymously, and explain I meant no harm. I feel terrible.",ShamedOfPostItPrank
non_PTSD,"So I got off early from work today and came inside. My wife had been over at the neighbor's place and was just coming back inside. I was just about to leave the bathroom (right next to our back door) and impulsively thought I could be really funny. So, waiting for the perfect moment, I opened the door and yelled right as she walked past.

It was perfect. She screamed and jumped really badly, and then began to laugh really hard as she realized what had happened. But there was one thing I had not taken into account during my impulsive decision. My wife was 39 1/2 weeks pregnant. Keyword: WAS.

Yep. I scared my wife into labor. At first we thought it was just flase contractions again, but very quickly realized that this was the real thing. Thirteen hours later and we have a beautiful, healthy baby girl.

Everything worked out well, but during labor my wife was NOT amused (though the doctor was a little) when she told him what had caused her to go into labor. Still, lesson learned: do not try to be funny by scaring your heavily pregnant wife.",Fear_my_revenge

It was a girl. She ran off before I could say anything. I remained for a few more minutes to chew out the bullies before leaving in shame.

The bullies didn't make her cry, but I did. I have never felt more awful in my entire life. I will forever now refer to people as ""them"" unless I know them.

For background I'm female, mid-20s and work a corporate job at a big firm. I decided to work from home today. There's lots of perks working from home, one being that clothes are optional. I set up my laptop and sit it in front of my naked body. We just got this new program set up where any call that comes through to my office phone is transferred to my laptop and can be answered on screen, using the inbuilt mic. Brilliant! Lets test this baby out. I first call my mobile from the program and all works great. I then proceed to call my boss (45 year old awkward male) from my laptop and, like a baby boomer using Skype for the first time, lean up close to the mic to test the audio 'Hi Boss! Just testing the new program out! Hows everything going?' I don't hear anything except slight background noises for a about 10 seconds, then he hangs up. Hmm I'll call my colleague (mid 30s nerd-like male) instead. 'Heyy! Can you hear me??' A stumble of words come out from my mic, I hear a faint gasp, a laugh and then after a few seconds he too hangs up. I give up. Maybe it's broken. 
10 minutes go by and I receive a call from a lady that works in the project division. I answer with a 'Hi Patricia!'. There's a long pause. I lean in further to my screen, boobs perked above the keyboard 'Patricia, I'm working from home today, can you hear me?'. I hear a 'oh my god' Then she too, she hangs up. Things are getting weird. 
Not 30 seconds go by and I receive an email from Patricia: 'swallowing_panda, sweetie, put some clothes on'.

I have a friend who works at this supermarket and this is how I got my internship at the store. After 2 hours of my internship I spoke with my friend. She told me that one of the cashiers thought I was cute. I was curious who it was because I never had a girlfriend before and have a low self-esteem. She pointed out who it was. I was really excited.

So I went back to the office and stared at her for a good 15 minutes through the one-way window. She sometimes looked at the window but I was like 'hey, you can't see me through this window' so I kept staring at her. I was pretty sure she was just looking at customers who were near the window. 

I left the office to go to the toilet. While I was heading back to the office I realized I could see through the window.

non_PTSD,"I have been seeing tons of idea threads and people seem to forget that this is an indie game with a developer who has already claimed he is busy. Some have ridiculous ideas that could be an entirely new game on its own, while others seem to be under the illusion that Wilnyl is a workforce the size of Bethesda.

Keep in mind that this is a one man team with no time. He cant program in sharks and boats any time soon as he hasnt even finished with the main part. He cant make entire new gamemodes and completely new AI systems for people to run on the highways (which never happens irl anyway). Well he can actually do all of this, but doesnt have the time and resources. Keep your ideas in tune with a 1 man job and easy to code. That way he can focus on his game and implement small tweak ideas.

Also keep in mind ideas for sedans, boats, trailers, small trucks. Those all have to be modeled and added into the game. You cant just grab the model and textures from thin air. Even then you have to do rigging and physics work too, unless you have a good engine.

Here are my ideas:

* Add a method for trucks to despawn, if not already integrated. This way you can reduce resources used by the clients computer, as well as add more trucks. Use on-ramps to spawn more trucks. Crashed trucks despawn after x minutes or seconds.

* Truck driver consciousness. Basically, evasive maneuvers but with a panic. When about to crash maybe the driver cuts the wheel in either direction, tipping the truck and possibly causing a roll. 

* Maybe a key combination (space and forward?) causes a wall run-up, which can help for climbing up trucks or small bridges.

* Depending on how you made your truck tires, you could add the ability to flatten them. Shoot a bullet; throw a rock, knife, etc and the tire gets blown. If you're using an engine a lot of the physics are done for you, which makes this feasible... and makes more chaos. You expressed the desire for combat so I imagine weapons will be added in regardless.

non_PTSD,"Hello friends of /r/drugs!

Me and my friends are into psychedelics. I have three friends of this group who have read Terence McKenna and their views of the ego are so... strange!

My thought is that the ego is the I, the self, the you, the me. Destruction of the ego is a temporary loss to show you that you are more than just what you think, even if it is all in your mind.

However my friends like to go off that the ego is what stops us from being Gods and that destruction of the ego makes us our own Gods. That society and culture are all delusions of the ego and that low dose psychedelics are ""lying to yourself"" and that they are a ""waste"".

I mean I smoke bud, do shrooms, and have taken LSD on occasions. I see it as a fun way to unwind and enjoy the little things, as a way to really do some hard thinking and soul searching, maybe even break through to a realm of my subconsious. Maybe even ego death. However I do not find the ego to be the obstacle that they are saying. To be honest I think what they are saying is complete bullshit. That they are looking into their serotonin and dopamine receptors a little too hard.

I have listened to Terence McKenna and he doesnt seem to mention *any* of this crap about the ego being evil and culture/religion the enemy. He does talk about meditation and enjoying these drugs, but not much more.

Can someone explain this to me? Neither of us are ""right or wrong"" as this is an entirely subjective concept.

-Consistent color, unlike semen where it is like... coagulated the slightest bit so it varies in viscosity and color throughout a sample. This was all the same color.

-Lube-like.

-The taste wasnt really there. Tasted like girly fluids, but still the taste was hardly there. Did not taste like male cum or precum.

-There was quite a lot.

However, I was wondering if anyone else is feeling like they are being strongly targeted by commercialism now that they are expectant dads. 

We've been through 3 midwifes before finding one that fits. And if I have to read another pamphlet about water birthing with herb extracts of Brazilian fertility butterflies or rubbing ones junk with lavender to make sure the baby is born into a world full of love and happy smells I'm going to lose my mind.

It got worse when buying a pram and a crib. My wife went through multiple reviews of strollers that ranged from a few hundred dollars to a whopping ten thousand, and don't get me started on a bed for the little blighter; I'm surprised they don't have one with pneumatic lifting pumps and speakers that rock the baby to sleep while emitting wifi signals to announce any time it farts to every device in the house.

And through all this as an 80's child I look back at my kids photos and I see myself being pushed around in a 4 wheel thin cloth stroller that folds down so much you could pick your teeth with it. And wonder what exactly went wrong here. I had a happy childhood .. I don't remember ever needing branded Nike kids shoes.

We settled on some good quality things - but I think back and I don't ever remember thinking to myself 'You know what, this ride is sweet but it could do with some rims and some extra pillows. And a coffee holder for my latte.'

Oh, and this whole 'things expectant dads should do' that gets littered all over the place. What happened to just being yourself. Whats with the over stress of 'you must do these things'.

Human beings have given birth for hundreds of years; suddenly it's 2016 and if you don't hold your child in a certain way to the sun while chanting voodoo curses on your mother in law your child will be deaf dumb and mute.

Am I the only one here feeling that every which way I look someones trying to sell me something that'll make my baby love me more; when really all I want to do is give the little blighter a better life than the one I had?

Well - I figured out a work around for all you sufferers of this issue.

* Problem - When you click 'new game' or 'PC Settings' the game instantly crashes and you can get no further.

* Resolution - Plug in an external monitor and make this your main screen. Start DARK SOULS and go to PC Settings and configure the settings you wish to have. Now create a new character. CALL IT SOMETHING THAT WILL REMIND YOU NOT TO DELETE IT (I called mine 'Config') it doesn't matter what this character is. Go through the setup brightness blah blah. This is a place keeper; do not play this character. Do not delete it.


* Now, this part is VERY important. Quit your game after entering it back to the menu and 'QUIT DARK SOULS' through the menu. This will save the settings. Closing the window or ALT+F4 will cause it to 'crash' and you won't be able to open it again and your PC Settings won't save.

* Unplug your monitor; start it up on your laptop screen and create a NEW character (leave config alone). 

You should have no problems from here on in making new characters. You CAN NOT go to PC SETTINGS. It crashes. But this does allow you to play DKS on a 48hz laptop. (Windows 10)

Note: This ONLY WORKS as long as you have a character saved. If you delete all character saves you are no longer able to start a new game. If you have a character already this 'work around' should already be working. Create a Config character that you never delete to ensure that you won't end up with no characters and you should have no issues.

 * Works with DSFix - Remember to turn off Anti Aliasing while on monitor or you get the ugly shrunken window.

non_PTSD,"So I'm a Onebro of DKS, DKS2 and DKS:SOTFS. I've PVP'd extensively in all the titles and beaten it all over and over. And I thought I'd share my take on Demon Souls after defeating it.

Demon Souls is my favorite in the series so far tied with Dark Souls and I'll be playing it through again to make a new build. I truly wish I'd been playing this amazing game in it's release day.

**The Good**

I found the game to be responsive and enjoyable; I recommend it to ANYONE that's coming from DKS or DKS2 to give it a real shot blind. When world tendencies changed on me I found myself exploring new areas and finding new items and actually THOROUGHLY enjoying the armor that's made for males, and for females. I played through as a female character and wore binded (something I got very early) but I'll be doing a new playthrough just to Dex build. Spells were tight and combat was really enjoyable. I spent a lot of time looking at characters and the .. detail.

Dark Souls has amazing details. It's extremely elaborate. Demon Souls is the same. Little things if you look hard enough like having slaves turning the cranks for the elevators. Items held up on chains and the movement of the weapons felt so natural.

I really enjoyed being a strength build. Watching things fly backwards from my great axe made it FEEL heavy. Something that's severely lacking in the later editions of Dark Souls. Heavy weapons FELT like you were throwing around a chunk of steel that'd run people over ending their miserable lives.

Most of the bosses felt unique and tidy. They were simple yet diverse and none of them were slow. They didn't give me places to attack or obvious cop outs and didn't telegraph what was about to happen. I was always on my toes and it truly felt like a fight.

**The Bad**

Valley of Defilement is a bitch. Seriously I don't know who decided to make a shortcut THAT FAR into the Valley; perhaps I missed a bonfire but it felt like FOREVER before I reached where I wanted to go.

The rolls felt locked in weird directions sometimes. On occasion especially against Maneater I rolled off a ledge when I swore I was holding to roll DOWN the bridge. It's something I adjusted to over time but it still felt very tight occasionally and I found myself in a lot of trouble.

The farming of Chunks is abysmal. It doesn't so much add to the difficulty as it does just drag out over time. +5 crushing took me about 45 minutes of constant farming ( I burned all the souls I gathered during this time without using them to keep my playthrough clean). I know the items can be duped but on my first play through I used no glitches and no bow.

The bosses bugged out easily. I chose to do the whole thing blind with no ranged and no glitches. But more than once I ran away from a boss and just had it .. derp out. The thief ring seemed to break a lot of things too. After a while I took it off purely for how abusive it was on the game mechanics. I felt that I wasn't getting all the game could give me. At least it's not Jesters Chest.

Some bosses felt .. underwhelming. No spoilers but one boss in particular was clearly there as a 'filler' and I felt let down. After great CGI I was ready for a fight that was going to rock my world .. instead I got .. well. A slug.

I feel there are some seriously powerful buffs that shoehorn faith into every build type. Without them you are at a huge disadvantage so if you want to PVP I feel they must be used. I refused to use Second Life in PVE. But I can greatly see it's merits.

**TLDR**

Over all I thought it was amazing and if you are PVPing and see 'AlmostArbitrary' please feel free to bow and then wreck my world.

a) What are the more 'common' pvp builds to look out for. I expect to be invaded and in DKS / DKS2 if I see Giant Dad / Katana buffed I know to be more careful. Are there any such 'horrendously skewered towards winning' builds in Demon Souls? (I avoid using the term Overpowered because I know that these builds can be beaten)

b) Are there any useful weapons to watch out for as I trek through beating the hell out of everything I come across along the way. I prefer weapons that are unique and/or are mostly unused. I find these are often the most entertaining weapons to visit and learn.

c) Does anyone have a good recommended build list for me to browse through and get some idea of what others have done until now. For DKS I can look at players like Oroboro but demon souls seems to have convoluted lists.

",AlmostArbitrary
non_PTSD,"Updated with thread suggestions.

Some people seem to be complaining about the meaning of 'cheese'. This thread rapidly turned into an 'easy way to beat bosses' thread. It is what it is; and there's PLENTY of cheese in it.

I have a few that I use that I'll list below:

**Smelter Demon(s):** With 100 Agi you can dive towards and left over his sword (while facing him, your left) and avoid almost all attacks. Because you end up slightly behind him it negates some of his combo attacks.

**Executioners Chariot:** Two words; Lingering Flame.

**Demon of Song:** Run up and push against the face until he opens armor. Roll back 2-3 times and wait for 2 attacks. Then run in and attack. Rince and repeat. (if demon does Frog Splash roll sideways then repeat)

**Duke Dear Freja:** Light a torch before going into the fight. Spiders are afraid of fire and makes the fight trivial.

**The Rotten:** Roll into the rottens stomach for every attack, then attack. Only roll back when the AOE starts up.

**Scorpioness Najka:** Wait on the concrete until she rises. Then run to the beginning of her tail where it attaches to her body. Stab/attack until she swings her tail (towards you hopefully) the sideways swipe. When this starts up run to the closest arm and stab / attack the arm. The swipe will miss. Rince and repeat until dead. She'll go into a 'swipe at you' loop.

**Old Iron King:** This fight is stupidly easy if you remember 3 things. A closed fist has to be dodge rolled. An open hand can be walked under if you walk closer to him. And a double hand attack usually has fire (move away before attacking). If you use these three things you can avoid all of his attacks while standing in front of him. With 100 agi I roll through any fire attacks  or just walk along stabbing / attacking his hand while he's blowing fire.

Alternatively, if you stand by the fog door he can't hit you with half of his attacks. The solution to most of his attacks is to just walk/roll to the right, he'll miss you completely and present an arm/horn/whatever to hit while he sets the part of the platform you're no longer at on fire.

**King Vendrick:** Jam yourself behind him between his left and right legs and swing at him when he stops moving. You can be here all damn day.

**Ancient Dragon:**  With a high damage output weapon. Run to HIS rear (left?) leg and stand between his toes. Beat the hell out of his leg. Only be weary of his breath attack.

**Dragon Rider (1st):** Do not raise any platforms. Enter fog gate and stand there until he takes (6 1/2 steps; his leg should be in the air when you start running) and run to his left (your right). He will thrust at you and fall off the edge.

**Mytha Snake Queen:** Sumon Jester Thomas (thanks guys)

**Royal Rat (Big Dog):** AOE the rats then stand beneath the 'dog' and AOE until dead. (Be weary of power vomit.) [thanks guys]

**Jester Thomas Invasion:** While not a true boss; Thomas will INSIST on gesturing you before the fight starts in Darksouls 2 (unconfirmed in SotFS) and will not do so while you stand near him. If you rush to him while he's being summoned and stand next to him; he will roll away and try to gesture until he gets it off. You can endlessly beat him until he dies during this time as long as you interrupt his gesture attempt.

**Covetus Demon (aka Jabba):** The jars above Covetous Demon's boss arena can be broken with iron arrows/bolts and the boss will ignore you and go after the hollows that fall down. ~ thanks /u/CheeseBiscuits

**Lud and Zallen, the King's Pets:** Use a homeward bone or aged feather and never get in the coffin ever again. ~ thanks /u/substandardgaussian

As a side note; this fight can be done by doing excessive damage to the first tiger before the second arrives to avoid fighting both.

Took off the back panel and the rear electric board is sparking like crazy. could this be the cause? there's also this silver ""box"" that's wired in directly to the rear electric panel, looks like a resistor but I'm not educated about these things. Could that be it?

here is the assembly. the silver box is what it think might be a resistor. the sparking occurs where the red wire attaches to the piece in the middle of the photo.

non_PTSD,"Last night was our first date. We met for drinks, had great conversation, she seemed smart and normal - it was a promising situation. I'll add that she is a 24 year old Japanese girl who moved to America six years ago. I've always been curious about sleeping with a born and raised in Japan Japanese chick - their porn and fetish stuff is so sick and twisted, will the real thing be equally bizarre?

Sad to say it was pretty tame, except for that whole ""crying during sex Japanese thing"". I mean what the hell is up with Japanese men and their preferences such that their female counterparts' lovesong has evolved to sound like a whimpering six year old?

Halfway through the act the whimpering suddenly stops and she gives me ""the look"". Those who have seen it know exactly what I'm talking about, and for those who have not yet experienced this moment I can best describe it as ""the moment her brain releases and epic dose of oxytocin which tricks her into falling in love, she becomes unreasonably attached, she now falsely believes I am the answer to all of her problems, and her uterus begins screaming for a baby milkshake."" I finish the deed, she gives me a back massage while I drift off to sleep hoping ""the look"" was a momentary incident and I won't be waking up next to a stage five clinger.

Upon awakening I find her lying next to me, smiling the creepiest smile I've ever seen and she's staring directly at me. ""I've been watching you sleep, and I think for the first time since I left japan I finally feel at home. I know I can make you happy, just give us a chance."" Then she starts cleaning my apartment.

I get ready and tell her I can drop her off at home on my way in to work and she responds that she's actually fine just hanging out at my place all day, that way it'll be easier for us to meet up later tonight.  Holy shit what a nutcase. 

I explain she can't stay but we'll hang out soon. It's been three hours and she already texted about 20 times even though I haven't responded.

What do you guys think, should I cut and run or stick around for a while?

I lock eyes with the frontmost man who has Down Syndrome, and slide into line in front of him. A few moments later I get a tap on the shoulder, and the man I had moments ago locked eyes with begins to explain in a broken, defeated voice that he's not with that group. I respond ""oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were..."" and my voice trails off as I realize that I had mistaken this rather unattractive man as having down syndrome and pretty much everyone in starbucks saw it go down.

I've accepted that I won't find that kind of chemistry again, but what I can't seem to do is stop thinking about the physical intimacy we had so that I can give myself a chance to move on. Let me be very clear about one thing: she turned out to be a really awful and terrible person who lied to me and betrayed me so I'm completely over her in 90% of the ways a person can move on...but I'm really stuck on the physical side of things.

I think about her every time I masterbate. I used to think about me fucking her but she has a new boyfriend now so that fantasy doesn't really compute, so now I think about her getting fucked by 'somebody'. I always think about her when I finish. I'm worried that every time this happens I grow more attached. I'm moving in the wrong direction.

My ability to date and sleep with other women has been impacted. The first few weeks with a new girl is always ok, but then I inevitably compare the sex I had with my ex to sex with the new girl...after that I lose interest in the new girl. 

I'm honestly terrified that my ex is going to live in my fantasies forever. That I'll never escape her. I'm experienceing a complete inability to move on. I'm scared that whoever I end up with I'll forever have this secret I'm keeping from her - that she isn't the object of my fantasies, and that I'm constantly thinking about and being aroused by thoughts of my ex.

It was an accidental series of events but I realized that having a pot roast in progress provides a very casual way to invite your date home, demonstrates your ability to cook (which is an alluring quality for most and will undoubtedly increase their attraction towards you), gives you the perfect excuse to crack a bottle of wine, and provides a one hour window of time alone with your date.

My mom does this thing where she asks me to drive her to places to run errands or buy groceries so I can get a lot of practice in. One day she asked me to take her to the local grocery store. Me being the kid that loves driving, I agreed. Now at this point, me pushing down a pedal to talk to someone became complete muscle memory. Around 2 minutes into the drive we have to stop at a red light. My mom starts talking to me about what car I want to get when I turn 16. I opened my mouth, and it happened.

Getting your hair washed by a cute girl is probably the closest I ever come to feeling like those guys in the movies who have beautiful women feed them grapes. (Idk, the analogy fits in my mind).  This girl goes all out.  Perfect water temperature, massages my scalp AND my neck!  I'm sitting here feeling absolutely amazing!  

She finishes up, puts some product in my hair and I'm feeling really good about how I look and feel.  This girl definitely earned her tip.  We walk over to the register and I swipe my card and await the prompt on the screen to add the tip.  My total comes to $16.20.  $5.00 tip is more than fair, especially since she went all out with the head massage.  I punch in my tip amount and immediately hit the confirm button.  As I wait for my recept, I watch the girls eyes get huge and she looks at me in excitiment.  She run from behind the counter and hugs me!  I'm flabbergasted!  She starts getting teary eyes and stumbles over herself to say ""thank you"" over and over.  I'm thinkin, man, it's just 5 bucks, but I won't say no to a hug from a cute random girl.  

She hands me my recept and I start to make my way to the door when I realize what had happened.  When I punched in the 5.00, I accidentally hit the 0 an extra time... I tipped her $50.00 instead of $5.00.  Shit.  At this point I need to make a decision.  Do I wreck this girls day by admitting I made a mistake, or do I just eat the $66.00 hair cut?  I turn around and take another look at her.  She's still so excited, looking close to tears.  She's probably thinking she's so lucky that this guy just came in, sat in her chair, and just helped her make her Christmas a little bit better out of the kindness of his heart.  I look at my recept again and sigh to myself.  ""Merry Christmas!""  I turn and leave, leaving a little bit of Christmas spirit and a nice chunk of my bank account.

TL;DR accedently tipped my hair dresser $50.00 instead of $5.00.  Didn't want to ruin her Christmas Spirit, let her keep it.

Edit: I'm male, stylist was female.

Edit2:  Holy crap my inbox...

So to clear up a few things.  

I've always gotten my hair washed after the cut.  This helps wash away the hair clippings so you're not itching all day.  I do my hair stylists a favor by washing my hair before each cut.

No I didn't shit on her chair.

I go to a Hair Cuttery.  I like it there.  People are nice and a cut is $20.  $16.20 with military discount.  I find it insane that people drop 50-100 every time they get a hair cut, but that's just me :)

As said above, I'm in the military, so I get my hair cut every two weeks.

Thanks for all the kind words and encouragement to attempt to go on a date with this hair dresser... if I can muster up the courage, I might, but I don't know if I want to rock the boat at a place I enjoy getting my hair cut.  Also, I'm less than 8 months from moving, not sure if nows the time to start a relationship.

I'm really glad some people can get a nice story from this, and if I changed a few lives because of it, that's all the gratuity I need.  I just want the world I live in to be a bit better.

The $50 would have gone to buying Fallout, but I'll be just fine picking it up after the new year. 

Merry Christmas ya'll

One more Edit I promise.

Thank you all who are offering to purchase Fallout for me, I really do appreciate the offer, but there are plenty of other people who would really benefit from your generosity more so than me.  You guys are awesome!

non_PTSD,"So, I'm a life long Cutters Choice smoker...well I say life long, I started on Golden Virginia and swiftly moved onto Cutters. And when I make my hand rolled cigarettes I use no filter so it is just tobacco and paper, I call it bareback!

Anyway, I just tried the Exquisite Blend of Cutters Choice tobacco, mainly because the shop had sold out of standard Cutters Choice. Having been a Cutters Choice smoker for some time now I was actually quite excited to see what it would taste(when smoked) like and what the aroma would be.

So I get back to my car, armed with my blue packet of Cutters Choice Exquisite Blend(this is where is goes down hill). When I opened the packet, there was no aroma at all, strange I thought... So I take out a cigarette paper and go to pull some tobacco out of the pouch but the tobacco is extremely dry and crumbly, it almost feels like paper that has been through the shredder. It is even difficult to make a cigarette without spilling a load of tobacco from it being so dry.

After much struggling(I may have emphasised this bit) I manage to wrap a cigarette paper around some of the dry crumbly tobacco and begin to smoke. Then, due to the tobacco being so dry, I get a mouthful of tobacco, something which hasn't happened since my first days of rolling cigarettes.

So, I'm now back home and just about to roll my 2nd bareback roll up! I hope this experience gets better as so far it hasn't been overly exquisite.

non_PTSD,"I'm a single guy and whenever my daughter asks what I want as a present, I always say she should bring me back a pretty girlfriend. It's like a running joke with her usual response being ""she better not be prettier than me""

Anyway I was recently really ill with tonsilitis. Like the most ill I've ever been as an adult, and after a week of it I decided to go to the docs to get some antibiotics. 

We're the waiting room of the surgery and daughter is reading through the magazines. She's holding up pictures of different women asking me ""how bout that one Dad? or that one, or that one"" I'm like ""what for?"" thinking she means hairstyles. She comes and whispers in my ear ""for a new girlfriend"" (bless her).

I tell her magazine people are not real and she needs to find me a real person to be my girlfriend. And that I would be really silly if I cut one of them out, put it in my pocket and told everyone that she was my girlfriend!

While we're having this stupid conversation a large elderly woman shuffles across the waiting room and sits opposite us. She remarks about daughter and how cute & well behaved she is....daughter looks at her, then at me, then back at her and says, as loud as anything....

""YOU CAN'T HAVE HER AS YOUR GIRLFRIEND, SHE EATS TOO MUCH!!!""

...before I had even processed what she just said, the stunned silence was broken by people giggling in the background, and the woman just ""hmmphd"" and turned away before I could apologise. ( I did say sorry)",burnmongham

non_PTSD,"So, my life seems to be stitched together by TIFU moments, going back as far as I can remember. Anyway this one happened this morning...

I was taking a shower, pretty normal, nothing out of the ordinary. I have a toothbrush and some toothpaste on the little rack thing, some days I'll brush my teeth while showering, some days I'll do it over the sink. 

I was up early so was taking my time doing stupid stuff like filling my ears up with water, seeing how hot I could handle the water...stupid shit like that..I'm 32 btw! 

Then I decided to brush my teeth. But instead of brushing to and fro with my hand, I closed my eyes and shook my head side to side. I was trying to see if I could get my whole mouth done while keeping my arm in a fixed position. It worked quite well until I'd finished...

The second I stopped brushing and opened my eyes I was unable see straight or balance and it felt like the whole bath tub was sinking on one side. I grabbed the shower curtain to steady myself, this immediately came off of the pole, I fell forwards out of the bath tub and ended up in a heap of naked ness and shower curtain on the bathroom floor! 

Still kind of disoriented I just lay there laughing, then I heard my 8 yo son run up the stairs and open the bathroom door to check on me! He immediately burst out crying! This made me laugh even more!!

When I finally got up off the floor and sorted the mess out and had spoken to my son he said he thought I'd gone crazy...he says heard me scream, then a big thud, then he came running up the stairs and saw my laying on the floor, naked, wrapped in the shower curtain, laughing my head off while I was foaming at the mouth! 



EDIT...tl/dr Brushed my teeth in the shower by moving my head only. Fell out of the bath tub, son burst into tears when he saw me naked, wrapped up in a shower curtain, laughing while foam was coming out of my mouth.

non_PTSD,Like a thousand pounds. Read a fuckin' book. ,awkwardurinalglance
non_PTSD,"I decided to go to a yoga class. OK. That’s obviously a lie. My GF talked me into it. She said something about how flexibility is a real turn on or people should be able to touch their toes without sweating and gargling, or some such malarkey. In reality, I think she just didn’t want to go alone, and taking me meant that there was no possible way for her to be the worst one there. And I’m obviously too dumb to realize all of this because it all just now occurred to me. Damn it. 

Anyways, I went. When we arrived, I was the only dude there. Everyone else was in good shape, female, and wearing all of the yoga accoutrements. Yoga pants, headbands, funky big shirts that still showed some part of their athletic tops, and bare feet. Most of them were standing around on one foot with their other foot flamingoed to their knees.  They were probably drinking herbal tea and discussing their upcoming retreat to India. They were all petite and graceful. And then there was me. I looked like a guy at a pick-up basketball game that was about to get chosen last.  

I walked over to the lady behind the computer to pay up. The computer was playing soft world music.  I paid my money, and was given a yoga mat, a towel, a foam block,  a nylon strap thingy, and a pillow.  I was fairly confused by most of these items, but I couldn’t help but be a little excited by the pillow and the prospect of a nap.  

When I walked in, nearly all of the spots were taken. There were two spots together in the far back corner next to the door and the fan. Perfect for the old cool down and escape routine I was already planning in my head. I put down my mat in its little premarked mat parking spot, and I flopped down. I left my brick, nylon strap, and pillow behind me.  I kept my towel close by. 

When the instructor came in and sat down, everyone got quiet. She spoke in a soft, pleasant voice. She used words like energy, spirit, awakening, inner, and good morning. 

The first thing she had us do was make a surfer, hang loose hand gesture and then hold our noses between our thumbs and pinkies. Then we were to alternate nostrils and take deep breaths in and out of one nostril then plugging it and breathing in and out of the other one.  Despite having a little cramp in my hand, I’d give myself a solid B+ for Nostril Plug Breathing Pose. 

After making sure that we got all of the snot out of our noses (I’m guessing that’s what it was for)  we were told to get on all fours. Once we were all into Mount Me Pose we were to alternate between Cow Pose and Cat Pose. Cow Pose means you put your chest and belly down. Being of a certain body type and having gravity on my side, this particular pose was no problem. Although, the term Cow Pose does seem a bit mean. Cat Pose is where you arch your back straight up like a cat stretching in the morning sunlight. Alternating between these two poses made me look like a giant, sweaty, dryheaving cat.  I’d give myself a B- for Yaking Kitty Flow.

After Yaking Kitty Flow, we moved into Child’s Pose.  Having taught children for years now, I’d say that this name is severely inaccurate. Child’s Pose should either be having your hand out asking for candy, pointing across the room because another kid did some stupid shit, or squirming around holding your crotch. This particular pose looked like a slave bowing to their masters in old films about Egypt. We were told that if we ever need to take a break, or if anything becomes too tough then we could always revert back to Eqyptian Slave Pose. This part worried me a bit since this pose wasn’t particularly comfortable. You are supposed to have your arms stretched out in front of you praying to the sun-god, Ra, while also placing your ass on the heels of your feet. But for some reason when I try to sit on my heels, it’s like I have a forcefield preventing me from going the rest of the way down. Apparently, my muscles are pretty stubborn. So, after the 4th  attempt of bouncing  my ass at my heels and nearly rocketing forward head first into the lady in front of me, I just accepted my version of Egyptian Slave With a Floaty Ass Pose. 

Next, we did a Plank. This is the top of a push up that you just hold for about forever and a day. Once your arms start to tremble pretty hard then you get to pick up one of your feet and point it straight up in the air at the ceiling. This is pretty smart because then your body doesn’t know which pain to focus on, so you just hone in on not drooling all over yourself. Once you feel like jelly, you get to swing your leg that’s supposed to be elegantly positioned at 12 o’clock, but in all actually is chillin more towards a shaky 4-4:30, all the way up to you chest and place your foot in between your hands. Having lost all feeling in my leg, I let it swing freely. My knee struck me in the chest and my foot landed on my hand, but my arms were thankful for the extra support of holding up my pudgy torso.

From here you get to stand up in Warrior 1 Pose. You pretty much stand like Rafiki holding up Simba for all the animals in the Lion King to see. From there you do a little jig and change to Warrior 2 Pose. This one makes you look like  you are surfing a huge wave. You put both arms out and pop a super hard gangster lean to one side. You’ll know you are doing it right when it feels like your leg is being slowly sawed off at the hip joint. Your arms are also supposed to be stretched out and strongly posed at 3 and 9 o’clock. But that shit hurts. When was the last time you held your arms up longer than the few seconds it takes to get something off of a high shelf or display your enjoyment when going on a roller coaster? So, after every few seconds, I kept pretending like I had different itches all over so I could release the tension from my arms. I also wondered how many people would notice if I just dropped down to Egyptian Slave With a Floaty Ass Pose. 

Then we cooled things down a bit. We laid down and just stretched our hand above our heads in ‘the remotes behind me and I can almost get it’ pose.  After this we were told to hug our knees and rock back and forth. This one was my favorite because after all this punishment, there wasn’t anything I wanted more than to get into the fetal position and rock back and forth. 

Now that we were good and warmed up we started doing our Venice Sausage Flow  (I may have misheard her). This is where you stand up. A+. Then you touch your toes (upper shins). C-. Then, you lumber down to a trembly plank. D+. Then you do this sort of circular push up that ends with your head up and your bosom thrusted forward like The Little Mermaid coming out of the ocean. It felt like a lap dance manuever. Then you stick your butt up in the air while on all fours, then sensually rise up. Then you just rinse and repeat. I’ll be honest, I felt a bit like Magic Mike with a hard emphasis on the XL.  

The next thing we did was cross our feet and and touch our toes (knees). At this point the GF assisted me by giving me my foam block. I would’ve prefered it be about 2 feet taller, but it did help quite a bit. This was the point that I started to notice how much I smelled. And despite being super happy to be right in front of the fan, I also happened to realize that it was doing very little to keep me cooler while simultaneously wafting my stench through the whole studio. Being super nice yoga chics, they only gagged slightly. If anything, it’ll prepare them for their Indian retreats.

After that we were told to get on our bellies. Aced that one. Then we were asked to bend our legs and grab our ankles from behind. In my younger days, we called this a flying squirrel. We would do this off the diving board all the time. Apparently, time has not been friendly to my joints.  Try as I might, I was unable to grasp both of my ankles. I got one of them once, but the little bastard slipped out of my sweaty hand as I lunged at the other one. This is when the instructor came over, grabbed my nylon strap, and put me into Self-Hogtie Pose. Fucking embarrassing. It was like sitting on an airplane, struggling to fasten your seat belt, and then having everyone watch as the stewardess brings your fat ass the seat belt extender. Since I was all tangled up, I was unable to just give up and enter Egyptian Slave With a Floaty Ass Pose. I just had to fight through the pain. 

After that we were told to get the pillow out. Finally, nap time! But instead we were instructed to put it behind our butts and lift our legs straight up in the air. Determined not to get strapped up again, I fucking killed it. My legs were straight as arrows for like a minute. Let’s be real though, they would drop considerably whenever the instructor wasn’t looking. But they were straight as shit when she was. 

After a whopping 75 minutes of self-inflicted pain, we were finally able to quit. At the end everyone was given time to sit quietly and reflect. At the end of self-reflection time, or as I like to call it, “swearing that I’ll never fucking do this bullshit again” time, everybody did an Asian hand clap motion and said the name of their favorite Indian restaurant.  I tucked my tail firmly between my legs and got the fuck outta dodge.  Yoga is not for everybody. 

TLDR- Stunk up a yoga studio, and got hog-tied by my instructor for sucking at life. 

Edit- Whoa! Thanks for the GOLD X7 !!!! That's unimaginable! I feel like Scrooge McDuck!

non_PTSD,"I finished C25K less than a year ago, but it was bittersweet. I could jog for 30 minutes straight, but I wasn't actually jogging at a 10km/h pace. So, it was a little disheartening to finish such a big accomplishment and still have so far to go. In less than a year however, I was able to finish running 5K in 20 minutes. I've lost about 20 kgs. I've never stopped struggling. I struggled to find time to run. I struggled to complete my runs. I challenged myself to work harder and run faster. It was uncomfortable at times. I never allowed myself to give up, but I also had to listen to my body so I didn't injure myself either. Try not to think of C25K as anything more than it is. It is a stepping stone to a better, healthier you. It's not a finish line, but it does strengthen your muscles and your heart enough to allow you to feel confident and run on your own. I love knowing that if anyone of my friends wants to go for a run, I can go now. If they want to go for a hike, I know that I am in shape enough to go. I am in shape. I am finally in shape. I can do all of the things that I could never do before. And if you just keep up the fantastic work (that I know you are doing already) then you can too. It's not a race. 9 weeks is not the finish line. It is a lifestyle change. I failed days. I repeated weeks. I struggled. And I am a better person for it. You are doing awesome. You will continue to do awesome, and I am proud of all of your hard work. Set your goals and knock them out of the park! You are going to be so proud of yourself and your amazing accomplishments that are yet to come. You will get there. I promise you. I got there. You will too. ",awkwardurinalglance

non_PTSD,"On the day before I was supposed to leave Vietnam I decided to go get another massage so that I could relax and hopefully catch some sleep before we had to head off back to Korea. The first massage I got was brilliant. This 90 pound Vietnamese girl just beat the living shit out of my muscles. She even did that Asian step on your shit with bare feet thing. As a helpful tip, if you are getting an Asian massage and you suspect that the masseuse is indeed foot-steppin’ on your shit, it is best not to try and roll over and see her in action. This movement will almost definitely cause her to fall off the table. (Mine luckily had cat-like reflexes and caught herself on a hanging picture) But besides that minor flub the whole experience was great. Plus it was cheap as shit (less that five bucks). So, I strolled on over to my old massage place that night and sure as shit it was closed. What kind of legitimate massagerie isn’t open at midnight on a Wednesday? Disappointed, yet undeterred I set off to find a new message place in which to break a 5 dollar bill. I assumed there would be a few 24 hour massage parlors in the area since the backpacker district mainly caters to foreigners. I also assumed that a 24 hour establishment would be shady as shit like many other aspects of Saigon. But I still searched the area through sexy bars, rats, and motorbiking hookers/drugdealers until I found the “perfect” spot. I ran across a really, really nice hotel that was advertising 24 hour sauna and massage. Booyah! This place was legit as fuck. I walked up to the 3rd floor and found an actual receptionist standing behind a nice hotelishy desk. Goddamn, this place was ranking pretty high up on the Legit-o-meter. Hell, it had already beat out my old massage parlor just for having a front door. I strolled up to the desk and took a gander at the prices.

SAUNA: $3
LEG MASSAGE: $3
FACE MASSAGE: $3
BODY MASSAGE: $9
VIP ROOM: $27

Luckily (I think), I only had about 15 dollars on me. I have long considered myself a VIP, but I am completely uncertain of what kind of special treatment one would get upon entering. Although I must admit I was curious. I mean if it had been $12 or even $15 I would have just chalked it up to hand job, blow job, or sex with a prostitute. But $27! That is like the GDP of that goddamn country. I can’t even imagine what they could be doing in there. I learned during my travels of the city through various cat calls (dog calls? siren sounds? Or maybe just hookers and drug dealers yelling shit at me) that pot was 6 bucks, cocaine was 9, and a smoking hot hooker was 12 (ugly one for 6). So, the best I could figure was that VIP meant you got to go in a room and sniff blow off of a smoking hot pothead prostie (or two ugly ones). But sadly, I will never know.

Instead I opted for the $9 body massage. A bit pricier than last time, but I was sure it would be that much awesomer. They led me into a changing room and gave me a towel to get into. There were two men just sitting in the room “working” (and/or watching dudes undress). When I put all my shit in the locker and locked it up they took me out into the next room. The sauna. It was nice and warm. There were a few steam rooms and a jacuzzi or three. My only issue with this room is that there were goddamn river rocks everywhere and they hurt the fuck out of my feet. But being the manly man I am I tiptoed through the pain with swan-like grace (and sailor-like cursing). Unsure as of where to go I just darted for the jacuzzi where all of the Asian businessmen were. But some worker caught me right before I could cannonball in. He led me into a steam room to “steam out my toxins” (I might have been a little drigh (drunk and high[on life.]{for mom ☺}).

I stepped into the steam room and almost suffocated on the goddamn smoke shit. It was hot as fuck in there. I asked if they could turn on the AC a little or something, but I don’t think they could understand. I don’t understand how anybody could find that relaxing. I was about to have a goddamn panic attack because I couldn’t breath and I accidentally scooted onto a hot bolt and I couldn’t find the goddamn door because there was more fog in there than a fucking KISS concert. Once I found the door I burst out of that shit all smooth-like, coughing my ass off, back onto those piece of shit ouchy rocks. The man that had brought me into the steamer now led me back into a different room away from the sauna area.

This new room looked like a prison cell. The walls were gray and barren and there was nothing in the room except for a cabinet on the wall, a drain hole in the middle, and two stainless steel tables (like the ones in the kitchen of a restaurant). The man asked me to lie down on one of the tables. I complied although I felt a little uncomfortable about what was happening. He gave me an inflatable pillow to lay my head on and then he snatched the towel right off me like David Copperfield. My comfort level continued to sink. Then he went digging under the table and came up with a water hose and began spraying me off like a dog. My comfort level rose back up a bit. “Right on, he’s just cleaning me off because I am all sweaty and shit. Sweet.” He stopped rinsing and then he went back under the table. This time he popped back up with a soapy glove. Before I could say anything the dude was washing the shit out of my back. I felt a bit awkward, but continued to chalk this up as a hygiene thing. I was just sweating my ass off in a steamer, it is just common decency to get showered off a little (although I am certain I could have done this myself). Then he went for my legs. “Well, goddamn.” I thought out loud. The worst part about the legs was that it tickled a lot. But if my Pops taught me nothing else, he certainly taught me not to giggle while naked and getting rubbed down by another man. I barely even smirked.

The next place he ventured was my asshole. I mean he didn’t enter the house, but I’ll be damned if the motherfucker wasn’t knocking on the door. He scrubbed my ass crack back and forth like he was swiping a Visa. The amazing part was that I didn’t want him there at all and I was doing my best to break off his fucking fingers and turn them into diamonds with my ass crack muscles but he just kept on cruising up and down Crack Ave. completely unabated by my defense systems. (I have to start doing some butt crunches or something)

(Author’s note: At this point I would love to say that this was the worst part of the story, but I simply cannot)

Once Dr. Touchybutt finished with my ass he slunk back down under the table and came back up with the hose and started to wash me off again. Even though I was bewildered as shit from having my rectum swiveled, I was fucking stoked that all of this would be over in a short second.
Then he said the last two word that I ever wanted to hear at that moment.

“Turn over”

I did. I have no idea why. (I do now know that I would have failed the fuck out of Milgram’s experiment) But I turned on over. There I was just laying there, cock swinging in the breeze, and hoping to shit that that guy from Law and Order: SVU would come smashing in and beat the fuck outta this bastard. All I could think was that if this dude starts jerking me off I am not going to like it one bit, and I am not tipping that much extra. Then Capt. Quickhands did a very “nice” thing and covered up my junk with a little towel (I mean huge towel!) and began the process of hosing my front. Then he once again soaped up and came back up with a glove and all I could think as he was scrubbing my chest was, “Goddamn, I hope that’s not the same glove”. He scrubbed my chest and armpits and then went down to my legs and feet. I actually kicked at him when he got to the bottom of my feet, because fuck that. I mean that shit tickles.

Then he went for IT….

Now he didn’t actually touch IT or rub IT. But what he did do was wrap “IT and friends” up in the towel that was over IT and he held “IT and friends” up while he scrubbed that no man’s land piece of skin between your balls and your butthole. So just to recap, he cleaned my taint (ancient southern saying: taint your nuts, but it taint your ass neither) while holding my towel-wrapped package ever so gently in the air (must’ve been strong, usually takes two hands). I have never felt so helpless in my life. I just basically went into opossum mode and played dead hoping he wouldn’t touch me anymore. Thank god he was only down there for a few minutes. I don’t think I could’ve taken much more. Then he put my package down and started hosing me off again. Then he asked me to stand up and give him the towel. He continued to hose me off.

Then he grabbed a towel and started to dry me off. I don’t know why this was my breaking point, but I snatched the towel from him and started drying my own damn self off. While I was wooling around my hair, I felt a towel go around me, and many tiny little fingers tucking it in at my waist. “For fuck’s sake!” I screamed in my head politely.

Once I was all dry and everything I was sooooooo ready to go get a massage by a woman. Hot or not. Regular massage or sexy. I just wanted to feel the least bit hetero. Then the bastard had the nerve to ask that I write down a tip so that I could be charged for being washed by a dude. There were two problems. One I didn’t want that fucking bath. And two I didn’t have very much money to hand out on me. I mean I should’ve tipped him fairly well, he worked his (and my) ass off. But I just didn’t have that much money so I did the only thing I could do in an Asian country. I pretended to be from Spain. Now I don’t speak any Spanish, but neither do they. I pretended not to know what a tip was. And after a frustrating 5 minutes he finally just took me into another room.

This next room looked pretty great. There were a bunch of chairs and juice and fruit and a movie playing. I plopped down on a chair and immediately a new dude came over with a tray of fruit and juice and sat them next to my chair. He got down on his knees in order to rub my legs, but luckily we both noticed at the same time that I was the only motherfucker in the whole room that was wearing a towel. The rest of the guys in the room were dressed in suits. I looked down at my new dude and said , “body massage?”. He took me over to a small smoking hot Vietnamese girl. FINAFUCKINGLY!!! I couldn’t help but think, “Just rub out a few of these recently added knots from the last room and we will just call it a day”.

The little woman led me into another room. Instead of a regular massage table, I found my self in the middle of four different chairs with sink things behind them. It looked like the shampoo station at the hair salon. She sat me down and made me lean way back. And then she….. washed my goddamn hair. For like a fucking hour. It would have been nice and all that except that this still was not what I wanted. And I knew that this bitch was also going to ask for a fucking tip. And like Mr. Grabass she deserved a great one, but I just didn’t have enough scratch to cover it. So, I sat there stiff and tense the whole time thinking about suicide. At one point a German guy came in and sat next to us and was talking quite dirty to his masseuse. The only reason I could tell was because of the way she was giggling after he said something and the fact that they asked me if I spoke any Vietnamese before they continued on. I of course said, “No bueno” trying to keep up my rouse of being a Spanish national. Then at the end of our session the little scalp juggler asked me to write down a tip just like the taint washer. Once again I played dumb as hell. I started walking into the hall and saying, “body massage?” and she just kept pushing a pen and paper into my hands and trying to force me to write down a number. I held strong and she was just about to give up when that German son of a bitch shouted from within the room.

“Hey, do you need my help? Where is he from? Does he speak German, Russian, English, French, Vietnamese, or Thai?”

She asked me where I was from. I was so fucking happy he didn’t say Spanish. I yelled back in the most American accent.

“Spain”

“¿Habla inglés?” and “¿Sabe de inclinar?”

I said, “Pour que?” which I think might be French because it seemed like he started rattling off in French or some goddamn language. Goddamn multi-lingual nazi. Anyways, fed up with life at that point and in general the cards being dealt that night, I just ran the fuck outta there. I told the chic that I had to check my wallet to make sure I had enough money. I ran back through the leg massage room, ran into and through the prison cell ass-rubber place, over the ouchy rock sauna and back into the changing room where I put on my clothes post haste and ran the fuck out. Before I left I dropped about 6 dollars on the counter and got the fuck outta there. I hope that the money gets to the buttrubber and the hairwasher, but at that point I could really give a fuck less. I walked back to my hotel room with my head down. I was ten times more tense now than I was before I went into that God forsaken place. Oh well, at least it only cost me six bucks. You gotta love a deal!



TL:DR- Went for a massage and got my taint and butthole washed by a tiny Vietnamese dude instead.

I work at an art gallery, and sometimes move around very expensive art pieces. Well, last week I had a terrible ear infection that gave me vertigo. I called in sick, but my boss told me I had to come in. After taking a tremendous amount of medicine, I felt alright, as long as I didn't stand, move, or breathe slightly.

My boss asked me to move a piece of art work, and I obliged because I'm an idiot. Not only did I have to move the artwork, but I had to put it up high on the wall because of the way we place our art. I had to get on a ladder and everything was fine until I started to get dizzy and dropped the canvas. The framing popped open, the glass shattered, and the canvas had a tear in it. 

I was near tears and my boss runs in and starts freaking out. Although I work in a gallery, I had no idea what was and wasn't expensive. This particular piece is worth $300k, and the artist, who is very well known, was loaning it to us.

I haven't been to work since and my boss let me go home early that day. I wish she would have just let me take the day off.

TL;DR Boss forced me to go to work, I damage $300k worth of paint.

EDIT: I haven't been to work since because I only work Monday-Wednesday. This happened on Wednesday. I haven't talked to anyone from the gallery since. 

Update: I decided to call my boss and she said she's setting up a meeting with the curator of the gallery and I should expect a reply on Monday if I still have my job. Might need to change this to TIFU by getting fired. 

Update Part 2: My co-worker just texted me and told me that the curator just got out of a meeting with the Board of Directors and they walked out of the meeting laughing. I might be safe. Maybe.

Update Part 3: I just got out of a meeting with the curator. He told me to let him know if I'm ever am sick and can't make it to work. I asked what happened to Linda (my boss). He said to wait for the employee meeting at noon to find out. RIP Linda. ",Fugeezy

I've always had a runny nose when it's starting to get cold outside, and it's annoying the shit out of me. It's mostly when I'm transitioning from hot places to cold places this occur, but sometimes when I'm in a stable temperature as well.

Example: I'm in my apartment (my nose is good now) and I go outside to the bus. My nose is usually good in the beginning (the first 1-2 minutes of being in the cold) but then it gets runny. And I'm sniffing the entire 15 minutes busride until I get to school, and I usually blow my nose when I get to school.

So I'm wondering what could be the cause to this, and how I can make it stop. I'm obviously producing more snot than everyone else, becuase I don't see any others sniffing their nose like I do on the bus (and they're not blowing their noses on the bus either).

I've tried a nose spray for runny noses, but I'd prefer a more permanent solution (Note: I have not used much nose spray, so that's not the cause. And it was runny before I tried nose spray as well). And I'd prefer not to blow my nose on the bus, because I have A LOT of snot and it makes nasty sounds.

non_PTSD,"This is a story from my hometown, Stavanger in Norway, and all the articles about the case is in Norwegian, so I'll do my best to translate for you.
___
**2000**

20 year old [Tina Jørgensen](http://static.vg.no/img/drap/sp0a494c.jpg) was on her way home from the city night to Sunday 24. september 2000 when she disappeared without a trace. She was last seen around 01:30am that night, in the city (Burger King).

During the investigation they were in a place called Lyngdal (100 miles from Stavanger), since Tina used to vacation there and had close friends there.

26 of october the same year, the police found her body in a manhole next to a church (Bore church) by coincidence. The manhole is about 20 miles from Stavanger (where she was last seen). She was murdered by being hit by a round object (according to the autopsy report). She was found in a white bag.
___
**2001**

Since 2000 they had checked the alibi on over 100 possible suspects, but they made their prime suspect on her boyfriend. They had a minor fight (relationship fight, not literally fighting) in a resturant earlier that night.
___
**2002**

In 2002 they dismissed her boyfriend as a suspect, and the case went cold with no suspects.
___
**2013**

During the winter of 2013 Rogaland Police Department decided to check up on some more new tips they had gotten over time. Short time later the case was officially reopened.

They also released drawn pictures of what the suspect might have looked like. It was a drawing of [""The Burger King Man""](http://www.vg.no/spesial/2015/faktakort-tina/img/fantomtegning.jpg), a person Tina had be seen with around the time she disappeared.

In September 2013 the case once again went cold.
___

**2015**

In the summer of 2015 the police got some new information about the case, pointing towards some people in Lyngdal.

The police received a sound recording from an anonymous source. In the sound recording one guy is talking about how he was there when Tina was killed, and what had happened.

On the sound recording, the suspect admits to recognising himself in the facial composite already in 2000. However the drawing wasn't public until 2013, and the police don't remember showing him the drawing in 2000. He also admitted to breaking in to Tina's apartment the same night to pick up a few things. Her purse and cellphone was never found. According to him, he had been on the phone with Tina a few days before.

16 september the 36 year old guy from the recording was put in custody. The next day 17 september they put 3 other guys in custody (one of them walked in to the police station and admitted he knew something about the murder, after reading the news that his friend had been put in custody), because of the guy from the sound recording.

Some of them, I think maybe all of them, knew Tina before the murder.

Three weeks after getting in custody, 9 october, they were to all surprise released. But they are (to this day) still suspects. They weren't sentenced because there wasn't enough evidence. And since it's a 15 year old case, they don't have any DNA profiles from the crime scene to connect to the suspects.

3 of the suspects all stopped working their regular jobs in 2001. Two of the have not had work since.

No one is arrested for the murder yet.

**EDIT**

This is a very broad case, with very many articles on it. Some articles say something, and then a few days/weeks later they correct was was said earlier. I did some more researc this morning, and I've added it in the original post. The changes I made were:

* The police already did some investigating in Lyngdal in 2000 after her disappearing, since that's where Tina used to go on vacation, and knew a lot of people. They thought maybe the body was hidden there.

* The sound recording guy admits on the sound record that he recognised himself from the facial composite in 2000, when they interviewed him in Lyngdal. However the police can't remember showing the facial composite so early (this was first public in 2013).

* In the recording he also admits that ""we broke in to Tina's apartment to pick up a few things"". He had been on the phone with Tina a couple of days before the murder.

non_PTSD,"So I need to get your opinion here. I dated this girl for around 3 weeks before I left 1 week on vacation (we agreed that we weren't seeing anyone else).

When I got home from the vacation, I was supposed to go on a cabin trip with her, some friends of her, and my siblings (they're good friends).

We didn't talk much during my vacation, because I was very busy (ski trip). Only a few snapchats.

2 days before I got home, I texted her and said I don't think I make the cabin trip, because I'm gonna be home so late.

Then, she blocked me from her ""mystory"" on snapchat (we did still snapchat each other, but I can't see her ""story"" snaps). So I get the feeling she's trying to hide something.

Turned out, since I couldn't make the cabin trip, she invited some guy from Tinder to join her. Without me knowing. At the cabin trip my brother and sister are on. Yeah....

I realise this is over, but I'm super pissed I had to find out through my brother. Anyway, I send her a text (very whipped text) saying ""I understand what's going on, but I'd appreciate if you told me instead of going behind my back. I hope this doesn't make it awkward between us"". (The reason I sent that, was because I'm probably gonna see her a lot because of my brother and sister).

She never responds.

The next morning, I wake up and see I got a snapchat from her. And that was a picture of the Tinder guy's dick.

Now I'm super pissed. I hadn't done her anything wrong. If she wasn't interested she could've just told me. One thing is cheating, but another thing is a picture of his fucking dick.

Yesterday I found out through a friend that she had been reading my messages when I was sleeping. A lot of them. And she has been talking to her friends (close and not so close friends) what it said. People talk, and people have found out about these texts.

I realise it may sound like I still have feelings for her, but I can guarantee you I have not. Now I'm just super pissed at this girl.

I want to confront her, to make her feel bad and honestly I wouldn't mind if I fucked up her future and friendships. But one part of me says ""Don't sink to her level"" and the other part says ""After all she's done to you, she deserves it"".

I want to hear your guys' input on this.

At least I always catch myself doing this. But whenever I try to keep cool, I'm afraid I come off as too serious. Especially when she tells a joke or says something funny, that I don't even find funny at all, I still catch myself laughing at it.

I've read a lot online about that this is a turn off for most women.

And it's not just the ""too serious"" stuff, it's also that I have a hard time being enthusiastic if I'm not smiling. I think it looks like I don't put my soul in my stories/replies.

I guess I'm not the only one who has/have had this problem, so I was just wondering if there are any ""hacks"" you can do to not smile too much.",Bagatell

It just seem like a lot of stress to write checks, cash them in, when you can just use your phone. And the security is amazing.

So I went around the front of the house and proceeded to lift open a grate which I thought would lead into my basement. I opened the grate and slid through this really tight sloping hole. Got covered in cobwebs, the lot. When my feet touched the ground I couldn't see a thing. Pitch black. I then stumbled into something metallic, like a drum kit. I turned my phone light on. I don't own a drum kit. Shit, this isn't my house. 

At that moment my next door neighbour comes running into his basement with a baseball bat ready to knock me the fuck out.

The lights switched on and i'm just stood there with the most sorry look on my face. He laughed it off in the end but I still felt like such an idiot.

non_PTSD,"This happened about 5 years ago while on a family vacation in Mexico. We were looking for things to do and my dad says he'll buy my brother and I a snorkeling trip for the next day. We agreed, had dinner, then me and my bro go to the bar at our resort for some drinks. My dad warns us not to get too wasted because the snorkeling trip is booked for 8am. Whatever Dad. We get to the bar, meet some girls, one thing leads to another and I get absolutely hammered off tequila shots. Blackout. Wake up to my dad knocking on the door pissed off saying to get the fuck out on the boat. 

Here's where the story begins. The rocking boat, scorching sun, and cheap tequila hangover were bad enough; then about two hours in I get the urge to explosively shit my shorts. No bathroom. I didn't want to move, but I decided taking a good ole fashion aqua-deuce is better than shitting on the deck. I grab some goggles, get in the water and swim away from the group of people. I figure I'm a good distance away, dive down a little, pull my shorts down and let loose. This was some next level shit. There's shit floating all around me, and that`s when I realize that fish fucking love shit. Tons of fish start pecking at it, and at this point some of the snorkelers are heading over since there's so many fish. I panic because I'm surrounded by my own feces so I just start wack-a-mole-ing the floating turds, trying to break them up. This causes more fish to come and more snorkelers as well. Before I know it, I'm surrounded by fish and snorkelers... and we are all swimming in my shit. In the end I'm not sure if anyone noticed my shit floating around, but it was still embarrassing as hell.

TL;DR Got wasted, went snorkeling hung over, explosively shit in the ocean causing fish and snorkelers to swim in it.

I'm living in Prague until May, and was wondering about options for downhill skiing in the area. A quick search turned up Rokytnice nad Jizerou, but I'd appreciate confirmation.

non_PTSD,"So I had this idea to make an old school adventure game using the directory system on my computer. Every decision you could make would be a different folder, and each folder would then contain a few more folders to choose from. Of course, this meant making thousands of folders, many of which would be redundant, and so I decided that the best way to make it would be by writing a brief little program. My proof of concept was a hedge maze, without any decisions at each step besides North, East, South, and West; before I did that, though, I wanted to check that my code for making a large nested directory tree worked, and so I wrote up my program. And then I compiled it. And ran it.

Hagrid.java was only a few seconds into creating his hedge maze when I had the horrifying realization that I had told my computer to make a directory tree with a depth of 100, and was thus on my way to creating 4^100 nested folders. I immediately reset my computer, but by the time I had booted it up again, there were 33,315,196 folders on my desktop.

Shift-Del gave an estimated time of 12 days to delete the thing, so I just made sure it wasn't being indexed by the computer and set it as an operating system file, so I'll never have to see it again. Nobody will ever know.

But *I* know. I know that somewhere, hidden on my desktop, there are millions and millions of empty folders. :(

**Edit 4:** Thank you everyone who made suggestions on how to fix my ridiculous problem! The one that finally did the trick was 

    cd blank
    robocopy blank ""Hedge Maze"" /mir > NUL

which fixed everything in a mere five or so hours. I've also edited my previous edit to say where my background's from and give a non-compressed version.

Thanks all! You make my mistakes a joy

**Edit 3:** Here's my [wallpaper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5yfxmxo96d0wuav/Streets%20of%20Rage%20BG.png?dl=0), which is originally from the SEGA game Streets of Rage.

**Edit 2:** Yes, I tried rmdir /s /q and not just Shift-Del. The reason why I decided just to hide them all was because that was also taking a kind of preposterous amount of time. (Then again, I have the patience of a flea, so who knows...)

**Edit:** [Proof!](http://i.imgur.com/oSxqxZJ.png) Well, kinda. My earlier attempts to delete got rid of around a million files, so I guess you'll just have to take it on faith that there were 33 million and not just 32.

(as well as a generic cd/dvd drive and keyboard)


I definitely would like to keep the case, monitor, and hard drive. I'm definitely getting a new motherboard, processor, power supply, and mouse (which has finally perished after a venerable 12-year run). I could be argued either way on the GPU and keyboard.




###Build Help:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)?**

Yep.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

This is the computer I use for everything, which in my case means wordprocessing, excel, listening to music, transferring photos from my camera, programming (Java and Haskell), and the internet (google, facebook, webcomics, reddit, deviantart, wikipedia, blogs, youtube, fanfiction, wolfram|alpha). I also use Sibelius (music notation software) and will occasionally brute-force my way through some data in Mathematica. I play video games, but not frequently and not competitively.

The primary goal for this build is longevity. Most of the things I do aren't super demanding, but I would still like to do those not-super-demanding things in five to ten years. This'll be the third pc I've built, so I'm comfortable swapping out parts to keep it running longer, but I'd rather spend more money now if it means fewer upgrades and less maintenance.

Finally, this computer lives in my kitchen/dining room, and my roommate is very noise-sensitive, so I'd prefer for it to be as quiet as is possible.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for?**

I have no need for a high-performance gaming rig. Those few games I play are generally low-impact indie games like Cave Story or Spelunky, RTS's that I don't play competitively, or games I wrote in Java.

**What is your budget?**

For new parts I guess target range is $500 to $750, but this is flexible. I'm willing to spend more for a noticeable increase in reliability/quietness/performance, but I'm also willing to spend more to make the computer feel more special (which is silly, I know, but I'm building it because I want it to be something I love and something that feels really mine). For example, I really don't need the fanless cooler, but it'll be quieter and it's beautiful so I'm probably going to get it. I guess you could say I fall more under the romanticist school of building rather than the pragmatist one.


**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA. I live outside of Boston, in the case that physical location is important too.

**Post a draft of your potential build here**.

My main questions/concerns are:

- Should I be replacing my old video card/RAM? I don't need much oomph from a GPU, but they're also one of the parts that go obsolete the fastest. And my hunch is that my old RAM is just as well as new RAM, but is this misfounded?
- Is my motherboard as reliable as they get? And is it compatible with the heatsink I'd like to have? With regards to the latter, NoFan's website has a list of compatible motherboards but they're all MSI, leading me to think that MSI has some sort of deal with NoFan, and not that all other motherboards won't work. Then again, it may truly be that MSI is the only compatible motherboard manufacturer.
- What should I be thinking for peripherals? I need a new mouse, ideally one that has buttons on the left and right for forward/back on webpages, but not one that is some sort of button monstrosity. I also need a new surge protector, because this is the second time lightning's struck my well and zapped my computer. Do y'all have any recommendations there? Lastly, should I be upgrading my keyboard? Are mechanical's worth the money? If I'm trying for a quiet build, is getting a mechanical just silly?

After a long long flight through a few connections from Kuwait, my dad wakes me up telling me that the plane has landed and we take our things from the overhead compartment and wait for the signal that it is safe to leave the plane.

The signal is given and we start leaving the plane to enter JFK and head to the security point to stamp our passports.

Everything goes well and after a few questions that the immigration officer had asked my dad, his passport was stamped.

non_PTSD,"I'll try to make this quick.

Basically, I met this girl from Tinder at a bar last night. We had great chemistry and ended up staying at the bar until close. During the date, I asked if she had met up with other guys from Tinder and how those previous dates went. She explained how during her last Tinder date, after a couple of drinks the guy asked her to come back to his apartment. She said no, she wasn't like that. The guy then proceeded to convince her that ""that's not how Tinder dates work"". Long story short, she ended up leaving and didn't talk to him again.

Now, I found this hilarious so throughout the rest of the night anytime she said no to any of my questions, I would respond with ""**But that's not how Tinder dates work.**""

Me: ""You should buy me a drink?"" Her: ""You should be buying ME a drink!"" Me: ""But that's not how Tinder dates work.""

Me: ""Want to play pool?"" Her: ""No, I'm not very good."" Me: ""But that's not how Tinder dates work.""

Me: ""Want to take another shot?"" Her: ""No, I have work tomorrow."" Me: ""But that's not how Tinder dates work.""

You get the idea. Anyways, we both found this to be very funny and an easy way to lighten the conversation. It was all in good fun.

So here's the fuck up part: At the end of the night, somehow we ended up going back to my place and getting in bed together. After some kissing play, she took off my pants and started sucking my dick. After a minute of this, I couldn't resists myself and in one of my creepiest voices, I said ""**Now this is how Tinder dates work.**""

At first she started with somewhat loud dick-in-the-mouth nervous laughter. But then she stopped and couldn't believe what I just said. And then it had killed the mood so much that she ended up putting her top back on and decided to quickly leave. Leaving me laying in bed, naked, with a semi-hard, thinking about how badly I just fucked that up.",throwaway_mi_dick

No problem, I thought as I reached down, took hold of his wrists, and lifted him carefully, in much the same way as I've seen a thousand parents lift a thousand kids in the past, the only problem being that for some reason I fucked it up and the next thing he was screaming like he had a broken arm. Horrified at hurting my child I balled him up in my arms and carried him straight home, apologizing all the way and assuring him that daddy loved him and didn't mean to hurt him. Turned out to be a sprain, no biggy, but it was a shock nonetheless.

Anyway, cut to later that night and the discovery that a child of two is more than capable of holding a grudge and being a vindictive little bastard, because no sooner had I switched off the light and lain my head on the pillow, lying peacefully on my side with my wife and son tucked up comfortably behind me, than I felt someone move and realized my son was standing over me. I turned my head and in the half light could barely make out his eyes, cold and without feeling. He opened his jammies and I had just enough time to cry out in horror, ""No!"" before he whipped out his tally-whacker, took a very deliberate aim, and pissed all over my head.

non_PTSD,"I'm looking after my sister's house for a few days while she's away. Been here a couple of days and I'm settled in. It's nice and sunny outside, so I decide take the dog on a bit of a hike. It was lovely. Sun beating down, bluebells in the woods, tweeting birds - it was a proper walk in the countryside. Happy days.

Got home and I'm a bit sweaty (balls are sticking to my leg) so obviously I need to jump in the shower. ""Ahh, a nice relaxing shower"" I think to myself as I soap up and feel the hot blast of water cascading over my shoulders. Bliss.
Then I hear the dog going crazy downstairs, barking and jumping around. So I jump out of the shower and open the window to see what he's barking at. Shit, it's a courier! I completely forgot my sister told me she had some parcels coming. I quickly wrap a towel around my waist, run downstairs and head for the door.

The delivery guy spots me through the glass and waits as I calm the dog down and tell him to sit. Good dog. I open the door a crack and the dog gets a bit twitchy. ""Stay!"" I tell him, and he settles. Good boy. Your training is going well. You deserve a biscuit. I open the door to deal with the delivery.
The guy hands me a parcel, taps his touchpad a couple of times and gives it to me to sign. I stuff the parcel under one arm, take the touchpad and look for where I need to sign.

Then I hear a woman talking. Then a little girl. It's the neighbour from a couple of doors down, pushing her baby's buggy up the street and talking to her (I'm guessing) 5 year-old daughter, who occasionally plays in the garden with the pup.
The dog hears his little friend and makes a bolt for the door. But I'm too quick for him. I put my leg out to block his way. Little shit dips his shoulders and rushes between my legs, catching my towel over his head and ripping it away from my waist!

So I'm standing there, bollock naked, touchpad in one hand, parcel under one arm, my junk basking in the summer sun, shouting for the dog to stop while my brain is trying to work out what the fuck is going on! Too many things happening at once! Confusion intensifies!

Delivery bloke bursts out laughing, neighbour's eyes lock onto my man parts, jaw drops and she scrambles to cover her little girl's eyes, who's standing there staring at my sausage with a look of utter confusion/horror on her face.
I quickly drop the touchpad over the offending appendage, shuffle backwards into the house, pull the door to and gather myself as best I can. Delivery guy (who's now in tears) hands me the towel through the crack in the door and I cover myself. I sign with a X, shout the bloody dog back inside, look up and lock eyes with the neighbour again as I shamefully slink back into the living room. Then I sit holding my head in my hands for about 20 minutes.

But here's the kicker. I opened the parcel to check everything is ok with [the order](http://i.imgur.com/JsCCQWPh.jpg)

Arse!


TL;DR I answered the door in a towel and now I'm probably a sex offender. Plus irony is a bitch.

When I was in high school I took a class on graphic design (photoshop'n'shit), and we used the computers in the school which always had the default school image loaded with a shitty green background, not much on the inspiration side of things. So, everyday when I would log on, I would change the wallpaper to get the creative juices flowing, and since Im a fan of sloths (who isnt?), I decided to set it to a picture of a sloth,[Sloth Pic I used](http://imgur.com/C0m38e4). All good, I get my work done, log off, and I leave a happy man.

Until about 2 hours later, when 2 of the vice principals (VP1, VP2) pull me out of my shop class and bring me to the office. I was asking what this was all about but they wouldn't say. So I'm sitting in a chair in the back room in the office when my graphic design teacher walks in, along with a police officer and the 2 vice principals from before. At this point im thinking ""Shit Shit Shit! the fuck did I do now?!!"", I'm sweating and I look nervous as fuck because who wouldn't be? After a what seemed like forever of them just staring at me, VP1 asks in a very angry tone, ""So, you like Beavers!?"" and VP2 says ""Because we don't!"". Now at this point I'm confused as all fuck, I have no clue what they are talking about. Im just sitting there staring at them with this blank look on my face. My Graphic design teacher was looking at me with probably the most disappointed look I have ever seen. I tell them I have no idea what they are talking about but they clearly didnt believe me because they started telling me that I could be expelled for this, and that I sent a girl (student) home in tears.  They tell me that this kind of sexist behavior will not be tolerated and that I should be in counselling. I finally start to clue in as to what they are talking about and I ask them if this is all about the wallpaper I set this morning. They tell me yes and that this is very serious. I try to explain my self to these people but they aren't really believing me so I convinced them to show me this in person. We take a walk down to the class which was empty at the time, I log onto the computer and lo and behold, there is my beautiful screen saver but because of the size of monitor it had been cropped. [This is what the wallpaper looked like](http://imgur.com/mjqN05T). I actually start dying of laugher, partly because of relief but mostly because I realized their fuckup. They thought that the shoulder of the girl in the picture was a actually a crotch/womans vadge area and that the sloth was a beaver (since beaver can be used as slang for pussy). And when I logged out, since the machine was not shut down, the background remained for the next user who happened to be a very sensitive girl I guess. She was so offended that the police were called (a little extreme if you ask me).  So im sitting there explaining my self and almost dying of laughter and I made sure to show them the full image. VP1 sighed and facepalmed and VP2 muttered ""I dont have time for this crap"" and walked out. I basically just got a stern talking to by my graphic design teacher about improper use of school computers and the whole thing was let go. I still laugh at this to this day.

TL;DR 
I set my wallpaper to a sloth but teacher thought it was a beaver-pussy picture. Almost got expelled when I was just trying to be creative.

However there is one thing that what's threatens the well being and longevity of these dreams; keeping my self asleep once I have realized I have conscious thought.  My dreams are often over before they begin because of this and in order to overcome this, it takes every last bit of will power I have to stay within the dream. I don't know if this is the case for others but it always seems my body wants to wake once I obtain conscious thought. 

Any ways, in the rare occasion I manage to over come the urge to wake, I have almost complete control over every aspect of my dream world, my abilities, other people etc., except flying, just like staying asleep flying takes a disgusting amount of will power to do and often times it's a risk that ends up with me falling hundreds of feet to my death, where I wake up and become pissed I tried it again.

Disclaimer: This fuck up happened back in November, on my brothers birthday.

Me and my older brother live in an apartment together in Toronto. His wife goes to college in New York. It's not TOO far of a drive, but definitely not close enough to travel to often. Because of this, he doesn't see her in person very often, but they skype each other for hours every night. In November, it was my brothers birthday and his wife decided to take a week off school to come visit and celebrate his birthday with him. 

A couple days before his birthday, my brother told me to go stay with a friend for the day because he wanted to dedicate the day to just ""chilling"" with his wife. Fair enough. I planned with a friend to stay with him for a couple days.

On the morning of his birthday, while he was still asleep, so I left him a little birthday present. We have a board in the kitchen where we pin stuff like bills, so I left him a note that said ""happy birthday big bro, have fun"" and I also pinned a condom and a $50 bill to the board. And as a joke, put 3 thumbtacks through the condom. My brothers a smart dude, so I figured he would see the condom has 3 thumbtacks, laugh, and throw it away. I thought wrong.

I leave for my friends house and everything goes as normal. I sleep over at my friends, come back home a couple days later, and celebrate my brothers birth week.

A little over a month later, on Christmas Day, my parents are over, and my brother makes an announcement. He tells us all that he is moving to Buffalo to live with his wife, who is now pregnant. Knowing my brother, I knew that he didn't want to have kids until he was at least 40, so after the announcement I pull him aside to congratulate him and ask for details. He tells me that the baby wasn't planned, and that when he had sex with his wife on his birthday, the condom broke. 

I explain the whole thing to him, and to my surprise, he actually laughed. He wasn't angry at all. After finding out his wife was pregnant, he realized that deep down he really wanted a kid, and didn't realize it. Now, his wife has a baby on the way, he is moving to New York next month, and I gotta find a new roommate to help pay rent.



TL:DR 

~~Got my bro a condom that was shitty~~

~~Now he's moving to the big city~~

(since Buffalo isn't the big city, here's a more accurate TL:DR)

Gave a broken condom to my bro

Now he's gonna move to Buffalo

A term that is very popular amongst many dopeheads is the term that is the term ""FADED AF"". Faded obviously meaning, drunk on thc, af meaning ""as F***"". Its popular because it is spelt the same way forward and backwards.

Update 3: fell asleep for 30 minutes before my friend noticed and woke me up. i keep thinking of random stuff, then feeling like that stuff isn't new like it's been a part of my life since birth it's weird.i tend to be thinking of cells like what you see in microscopes, I don't know why. probably because I have a science test soon

Update 4: I wrote my science test yesterday. It was about light and mirrors, I think I did pretty well, the only question that I think I made a mistake on is that I was supposed to give 5 an examples of a convex mirror.

Last night, I was alone, and I was bored. So I went to my local LCBO and purchased a 750 mL bottle of Gibsons whiskey. I've never been drunk before, so I figured why not try it out. I ended up drinking 2 50/50 drinks of whiskey and coke, and then a bunch of shots. I don't know how many shots, but I ended up drinking a little bit over half of the bottle, so like 375 mL. I woke up this morning, and I puked a few times, but that's it. I didn't have a headache or anything, just a stomach ache for a couple hours. After a couple hours I was completely fine.

**Tl;dr of [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2qliev/tifupdate_letting_the_corporate_holiday_party/):** Corporate Holiday party. Infatuated with beautiful coworker who has two hot friends who are also coworkers. Lots of alcohol. Four-way. Ran out of condoms. Start dating the girl of my dreams. Find out I impregnated both of her hot friends. One of them is crazy.

I think the easiest way to do this update is going to just be a per-person update. I'll elaborate if I need to. Also, sorry that there's more names to keep track of. 

**Me (I):**

I'm still with Angie, she's living full-time at my place and has been since February. At work, I'm off probation and now I'm working directly at a client site. The last of the pranks was when I walked in to work the day before Valentine's day to find a box of 1000 condoms. The fuckers spring loaded it. They were everywhere. Now that I'm in a client environment where the people who know either can't or wouldn't dare continue the joke, my career seems to have come out without too much tarnish on it. 


**Angie:**

She moved in with me and broke her lease shortly after. She got a new job offer at the start of the month that came with a substantial raise and I encouraged her to take it. She started Monday and so far she loves that the people she works with aren't fully aware of our personal life. She went out drinking with her new coworkers Friday, she explicitly forbid me from joining them but did so with a smile. I don't know how long that's going to last, but I'm not sure I'm eager for it to change either. 


**Heather:**

Angie and I went with Heather to terminate the pregnancy in early January. She never told her sister about it. She decided that where she was in life it was going to hurt her career to carry the child to term, even if she would be giving it away. She just wanted it all behind her, and it seems to be. She's no longer friends with Lena and hasn't spoken to her in months.

Management seems to have put a lot of the fault of our situation onto her, but she referred in a major contract for the company and has since been promoted. She's no longer involved with development and is now primarily part of the sales team.

Heather and her girlfriend are frequent visitors to our home. I've learned my lesson, if Angie and I retreat to the bedroom while they're still here, I lock the door.


**Lena:**

She's still pregnant and she's still crazy. 

At first, she was still adamant that we were going to end up together. There's been a couple times when I have bought a single rose to put on Angie's desk in the morning, when I got one on my desk for my birthday (Jan 17), I just smiled and set it aside. Then Angie came over for us to go to lunch and asked whom it was from. If you've never had to simultaneously process that the gift on your desk isn't from your GF while explaining to your GF that you thought it was from her, it's a stressful situation. She almost freaked when we got back and there was a cake on my desk. Thankfully, my boss claimed responsibility for the cake. 

The next day, I had a deployment scheduled so as usual, a couple people on my team (myself included) came in late and would stay until about 9pm (opposed to the usual 5:30). My role in deployments has me there solely to hotfix any issues, I'm not part of the main sequence and I just sit on netflix most of the night. I went to the restroom at about 7:30 and thought nothing of the door opening as I stepped to the urinal, thinking it was just another member of my team. Then a pair of hands wrapped around my waist and moaned ""It's time for your birthday present!"" In shock, I spin around and find Lena in naught but a lace bra and crotchless panties. I started stammering about wtf she was doing but she wouldn't hear it and just said ""your mouth is saying no but your body disagrees..."" Then the door opens. Adam, my team's system admin walks in to find barely-clothed Lena with her hand on my chest and me shouting obscenities with my cock flying free at full mast. I collect myself enough to bark ""GET THE FUCK OUT!"" to Lena, she grabs her longcoat and runs past Adam crying. I turn back to the urinal and do my business. Adam, a man of few words, steps up to one of the urinals and just says ""that's why you don't stick your dick in crazy"". I laughed and vowed that that man would never pay for another drink in my presence. 

Lena got fired the next day. I'm damned lucky that Adam heard me objecting before he opened the door or I might've shared her fate.



That weekend, I'm at my place hanging out with my friend, James, when there's a knock at the door. It's a man I don't recognize in jeans and a dress shirt, I didn't think anything of it and open the door. 

""Hi""

""Are you <my name>?"" 

""Yes? Can I hel-"" 

He cold clocked me. 

I'm really lucky James was there because I was not recovering fast enough to defend myself. James steps in and the guy had no interest fighting him so he just starts shouting at me ""First you raped and impregnated my sister, now you've gotten her fired? I should fucking kill you!"" That was my first introduction to Travis, Lena's older brother. 

I responded ""Fuck you! I didn't rape her and she got fired for trying to rape ME!"" That surprised Travis enough that he demanded I explain. He calmed down when I told him about the girl's conversation in the bathroom that night and sat down to let me tell my side. The version Lena had told him had me going home with only her and then forcing myself upon her when she wanted to take it slow and that I had told her to meet me in the restroom at work. 

Angie came home to find the three of us sitting on the couch sharing a beer while I held an ice pack to my eye.  He told me that as early as Thanksgiving (weeks before the party), she had told her family that she had a boyfriend whom she worked with by my name. I'm the only person at my company with my name. I explained to Travis that I've never had feelings for his sister and that I never would. I told him that, although I think she should terminate the pregnancy, I was more than willing to pay child support or even take custody of the child when it's born (conditional on a paternity test). He apologized for the punch and gave me his number, saying I can send any communication for Lena through him so he can keep her in line.



Travis and I have sort of become friends, though he was transparent in why he wanted to spend more time with me, he wanted to know if he would be comfortable with me raising his niece/nephew. Yesterday, Travis organized me meeting their father, and the two of them are now going to try to convince Lena to give me the child. Since she started showing and her mother knows she's pregnant, getting an abortion is no longer an option. Lena has moved back in with her parents and got herself a comparable job elsewhere. The baby's first ultrasound showed nothing to be concerned about, so at least there's that. 

TL;DR the update: Don't stick your dick in crazy, also read the story of Icarus and actually take it to heart. ",BestChristmasParty
non_PTSD,"I originally posted this story Thursday night, but eventually ran into Rule 11. So before I give an update, here’s the original story. I’m not unable to sleep and typing on an ipad anymore, so I took the time to clean up what had been a stream of consciousness. People complained about my use of first initials rather than pseudonyms, so I fixed that (A is now Angie, H = Heather, L = Lena if anyone wouldn’t have picked up on that.

EDIT: I've been narrated! Big thanks to /u/Cyae1

Original Story (Christmas Night):

This TIFU is still developing, but requires a little backstory first. I've been working at my company for the past year, it's my first job out of college. Additionally, my office is blessed with a surprisingly high number of attractive women for a tech company (most of them were business majors, but I’ll take it). I've become very close friends with one of them, Angie.

It took me less than a month of working with Angie before I was convinced she was the girl of my dreams. Being the new guy and having to directly work with her daily I never tried to be more than friends in fear of the situation if she said no. She moved to a different team in June so we rarely see each other during work anymore. Angie got engaged in July. When discussing it with her I made a comment to the extent of ""I'm happy for you but sad that we never got to try 'us'."" I was drunk and knew it was a fuck up immediately but I was glad to have it off my chest.

We didn't talk for a few days and then I got a text inviting me out for drinks like a normal Friday night and both went on like I never said it. Fast forward to October and she catches her fiancé with an ex. Angie is no longer engaged. She came to me crying and we just sat on my porch drinking for the night. She tells me she is done dating for a while. I recognized then that I loved her as my best friend and just held her for a few hours. We started spending a lot more time together, but it was always just as friends.

So that sets up my relationship with Angie. Other coworkers you need to know: Heather and Lena. They’ve been best friends since college and Angie has kind of joined their little circle. Both of them are attractive but I've spent the past year unable to get Angie out of my mind (I'm forever the romantic, fuck me). I’m “friends” with them to the extent that they go out drinking with Angie and me regularly, but I don’t really talk to them much during the week. 

Now for our company's Holiday party on December 6th.

My company is a work hard, party harder company. The amount of alcohol we drink is insane for the corporate world, with over 2000 drinks served for ~320 people before the after-party.  I went alone to the party and so did Angie. We got drinking and midway through the party she gives me a quick kiss in front of Heather and Lena. The kiss throws me completely off as I'm now wrestling with feelings I thought I had tamed while being afraid of taking advantage of her since she was still upset about the breakup. The trio starts giggling and I’m thinking that that kiss might just be something Heather and Lena tease me about on Monday.

The night continues and the four of us share a cab to the after-party. Angie sits on my lap for the cab ride and kisses me again. I was hard under her leg for the rest of the ride and only got a couple winks from her as acknowledgement of it. Getting out of the cab Angie whispers in my ear ""neither of us are going home alone tonight, but first we party"".  My three companions all go towards the restroom and I make a beeline for the open bar and swap over to vodka red bull to drown what’s left of my inhibitions; I'm going home with the girl of my dreams tonight. Oh how I wish we had just dropped off Heather and Lena and gone to my place then.

With a few vodka red bulls and Angie’s comment replaying in my mind, they were able to coax me onto the dance floor. I know I can't dance so I actively avoid the dance floor. Apparently I could dance that night though. Spending the time on the dance floor allowed me to sober up enough to realize Lena is dancing on me almost as much as Angie. I decided to stop drinking then so that a) I could remember everything from this night and b) I wasn't going to underperform for Angie. If only I had kept drinking.

Getting a straight red bull from the bar when I go to grab the girls more, I returned to the dance floor to see them dancing together in a way that I will never be able to want to forget. I step back and watch for a few minutes. Oh how I wish I had rushed back out there with their drinks.

While watching, I see Heather kiss Lena. I knew Heather was bi, but I never thought about Lena. Heather then kisses Angie and I damn near dropped the drinks. I believe I operated with a low blood supply for organs above my belt for the rest of the night. When I get to them with their drinks, Heather downs hers and kisses me. I thought it was going to ruin everything between me and Angie until Angie ran her hand across my arm and I saw she didn't object. I'm now convinced I'll never have a better night than tonight. I pull away and suggest to Angie we say our goodbyes, meet outside, and head back to my place. I knew what I was hoping for but only expected Angie to join me. My life would be so much easier if I did not get what I had been hoping for.

I say goodbye to a few important people and head outside to hail a cab. Angie is standing there with Heather and winks at me again right before Lena grabs my ass and joins us. I get us a cab and again Angie is in my lap. I get more than a wink this time as she wouldn't sit still and was effectively giving me a lap dance for the short ride home with constant eye contact. I think Heather and Lena were making out but I wasn't paying attention to anyone other than Angie. I don't know how that cab ride could have gone differently, but I wish they would've fallen asleep or something before getting to my place.

We get to my place, Heather and Lena move to my couch as Angie and I are tearing each other's clothes off on the way upstairs to my bed. Why couldn't I have locked my door...

I'm on top of Angie when I feel extra hands touch my back. Raw excitement and realizing that I didn’t misread any of the earlier cues cost me my condom. My last condom. Angie whispers that she's on the pill and it’s game on for a foursome I'll forever cherish and regret.

The next morning, I wake up with 3 beautiful women in my bed and I felt like a Greek god for the first time in my life. After brunch, Heather and Lena both kiss me goodbye and get into a cab. Once they had left, Angie kisses me and returns us to they had so rudely interrupted the night before...

Angie and I have been dating since that night and she is everything I imagined her to be. I've spent most of December thinking I'm the luckiest guy on the planet. I got girl of my dreams and it got serious after a four-way. While most of the office now knows Angie and I are dating, almost no one knows the true events of that night so it hasn't really changed anything at the office. I’ve been talking to Heather and Lena more often though.

Fast forward to Tuesday. Angie and I are driving to my parents for Christmas (we went to hers for Hanukkah) when I get a distressed call from Heather over Bluetooth so Angie is part of the conversation too.

Heather is pregnant.
I'm the only man she's been with this year, so she hasn’t been taking the pill. Fuck. Angie is the first to start crying and I pull over before I am tempted to take the car into incoming traffic. We sit there and talk for a half hour before cooler heads prevail and we agree that Angie and I will leave early and be back early Friday. We'd have turned around immediately but keeping my parents oblivious will make it so much easier. Angie and I talk for the remaining hour of the drive and she says she's not mad at me since the four-way was her idea and we'll get through this. My parents pick up that I was stressed, but we manage to pass it off as stress from corporate politics.

Then there's today. Christmas. I get a call from Lena when I'm out alone with the dogs.
Lena is pregnant.
She doesn't know about Heather or at least doesn't mention it. What she does do is confess that she's in love with me and wants to keep it. She wants me to leave Angie and marry her before the baby starts showing or she's going to claim I forced myself onto her while she was passed out at my place.

I talk to Angie and she's in tears again. She hugs me and keeps saying we’ll get through this. I bring in my uncle (also my lawyer) to address her threat and says so long as Heather tells my side of story I'll be fine but we need to tell HR everything first thing Monday. Angie was holding my arm crying into my shoulder the whole time but she agreed. 

The last 48 hours has been an emotional roller coaster and it doesn't look to be ending anytime soon.

P.S. No, I didn't bat 3/3, let's just say I didn't enjoy Hanukkah as much as I wanted to.

TL;DR: Corporate Holiday party. Infatuated with beautiful coworker who has two hot friends who are also coworkers. Lots of alcohol. Four-way. Ran out of condoms. Start dating the girl of my dreams. Find out I impregnated both of her hot friends. One of them is crazy.

Additional info, most of which was posted in comments of the old thread:
 
* Yes, Angie’s ass is Kate good.
* Mentally, I heard Angie telling me she was on the pill to mean they all were. She thought they were too.
* My best friend bought a pregnancy test and took it to Heather on Tuesday, it was positive.
* Heather was supposed to start her period on the 10th, she had been taking tests since the 12th and first tested positive on the 22nd, she called me when she tested positive the morning of the 23rd.
* I went to the doctor on the 19th, I need to check up with him again next month, but I got a clean bill of health.
* I came 3 times: in the condom, in Angie, and on Heather’s stomach. I apparently pulled out late on the last one.
* On the last one, Lena had pushed me into her quickly afterwards. I had thought she was just trying to keep the party going. My mortality caused me to tap out shortly into round 4.
* None of them are supermodels, but Angie gets a solid 9 and the other two are both 7.5+.
* The foursome was a result of Heather joking about it on that bathroom trip and then Angie convincing them to make it more than a joke. According to Angie, Heather’s made the joke before.
* Heather is business-side while I’m a developer, but she would be my superior if we were on the same team. It can be assumed she makes more than I do.
* Lena is in accounting. I have no idea what she makes.
* Angie tried to talk to Lena yesterday. She hung up when Lena started shouting at her.
* For what it’s worth, I’m 24, Angie is 23, both Heather and Lena are 26.

I also want to include the comment that made me laugh the hardest on the last post:

By /u/moshisimo
>A and I are driving to my parents for Christmas

I? Who the fuck is I? When was I introduced??? Oh... never mind...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 1: On Friday, Angie and I talked to Heather upon getting back in town. She doesn’t want to keep the child, though she is going to ask her older sister if her and her husband want to adopt it. Her sister is infertile due to complications from her first child. If they say no, she’s going to terminate the pregnancy. She doesn’t expect assistance from me with either option, though I volunteered to pay for the termination if that’s where it goes.
 
She hadn’t talked to Lena but is appalled by her threat. Apparently Lena’s parents have been pressuring her to settle down and have kids while she’s young. Her family is very religious and will likely disown her for having a child outside of marriage. Heather told us that Lena has had a crush on me for months, I was just too obsessed with Angie to see it. She’s been upset about Angie and I being together. Her self-image took a hit when I was unable to keep going while in her (It was round four damn it!). I was the first man she had ever not used a condom with and she blames Heather for convincing her to do it.
 
Heather volunteered to talk to her as I wouldn’t be able to calm down Lena without a ring.
 
Update 2: Angie accompanied Heather to the doctor Friday afternoon for a blood test. They got the results early this morning. Heather is definitely pregnant. She’s going to wait a month to make sure there are no issues before making the offer to her sister. For now, all quiet on the western front.
 
Update 3: Heather talked to Lena. It didn’t go well. At least Heather recorded it.
 
Lena did get a positive result on the pregnancy test that Heather brought with her. Heather watched and knows it wasn’t tampered with. Fuck.
 
Lena is maintaining that I would be far happier with her than I would be with Angie. She said that we’re destined for each other and the baby proved it.
 
When confronted about the threat, she turned on Heather. She was yelling at Heather for how much she drank that night and pressuring her into joining the foursome knowing her feelings about me.  

When Heather informed Lena that she was also pregnant from that night and was considering an abortion, Lena went full holier-than-thou and likely ended their friendship with some of the comments made. The conversation ended there with the situation involving Lena infinitely worse now that Heather can't talk to her either.

-----------------------------------------------------
UPDATE 4: Angie heard me listening to the narration again. She's now reading the comments. So far, she's said I shouldn't have posted this, but y'all are making her laugh, so I should be ok.

-----------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 5: A coworker just text me ""For Frodo!"" Tomorrow is going to suck. He's enough of a friend that it won't be break room gossip, but I'm now considering who else could connect the dots.
Update 5.1: I'm removing a couple comments because of this. He said he only made the connection because he saw Heather kiss me, but I'm still going to cover my ass on this one. None of the comments I'm removing include stuff that happened that night.

-----------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 6: I have assholes for coworkers that are on reddit. I a four boxes of condoms were on my desk when I got in this morning. I'm lucky that I got in earlier than my boss. Other than a few ""For Frodo!"" calls, there wasn't anything else said to my face. Thankfully they've spared Angie so far.

Update 7: Talking to HR wasn't as bad as expected. Angie and I went to them as soon as they got in. They let us talk, it was mostly me exempt for the parts where I wasn't there like the restroom trip. We actually did manage some laughs from the guys in HR, one of them had actually read this TIFU. He said that I stopped short of identifying the company so posting this doesn't add to my situation. There is a good chance all four of us will end up on probation, but if we can keep it civil and avoid additional fuckups, we should be ok. 

They talked to Heather and Lena individually. Lena went home for the day afterwards and I don't know any more details about her. Angie has been talking to Heather since she got home. Apparently she was told similar things by HR, though the responsibility talk from one of her bosses was apparently very awkward.

But there's always that one friend who doesn't understand boundaries and why you shouldn't cross them. That ignorant bastard. 

""So, did you kill anybody?"" 

I can feel my heart sink into my stomach, and with those five words all the memories I've tried so desperately to repress come flowing through my mind. 

Images forever burned into my conscience. 

How we got into this situation was the same for most of us: we wanted to be heroes. We wanted to be a part of something bigger than us. Granted, there is that one guy - down on his luck - who is up to his knees in debt. They told him all his worries would disappear if he just signed on the dotted line. He needed a way out and couldn't think of any other options. But even then, in the back of his mind, the idea of ending another man's life without consequence - maybe even praise - had to impact his decision in some way. He could have chose a safer job... Anything but Combat Arms. But why fix the damage when you can inflict the damage? You're a joke if you get a medal for making sure everyone gets paid on time. 

In the long run all we really want is recognition. 

One-hundred and thirty-eight days in country and not a single thing to write home about. You could feel the hostility in the air. Each and every one of us were growing tired of the monotony. All we wanted was a real reason to clean our weapons. And this is the insanity that the US Military inflicts among its servants. Train a man to kill, give him guns and grenades, throw him into a desert and suddenly he wants to get shot at. We were all normal once-upon-a-time. Eventually everything fades to gray and you can't remember what exactly normal is anymore. At this point every man in Charlie Co., 2st Platoon, Alpha Team didn't realize they've crossed the point of no return. 

I couldn't see what I was shooting at, but it didn't matter. The gurgled screams let me know I was hitting something. It felt good. I'd clean this M2 better than I ever had when I get back. The lesson I learned that day is that Positive Identification isn't always necessary. Before I get ahead of myself, let me explain. Those bastards thought they could take shots at us then run into a Mosque and they would be safe. Well, your Holy Place isn't mine. Your God can't judge me. Out here life is a gift, and you have to be willing to take that gift away without a second thought about it. 

Out here, standing by a road with a shovel can get you killed. 

With my adrenaline pumping I guess I didn't notice what time it was... it just slipped my mind. All that matters is the target was eliminated; mission accomplished. The weight had immediately been lifted off my shoulders. I finally got what I was looking for and I felt vindicated. 

After the Air strike there wasn't much left of the Mosque, and the screams finally subsided. Sifting through the rubble, the pride I felt started to subside, and a sense of nausea overcame me. I stumbled upon what appeared to be a hand - a tiny little hand. I had never seen gore like this. A hand, a foot, an arm, a leg. Things unrecognizable as human. Ground beef. What have I done? These people weren't the enemy. These were human beings like you and I. Men, women, and children reduced to humps of body parts. I can never look at a hamburger the same way again.

I was 18 years old and had just moved out of my apartment about a month prior. An acquaintance of mine moved into the same apartment 'block' as me a month before I moved out. This is important. 

She held a party one summer evening at her apartment and I attended with some friends. I should say, at the time I was known as a guy that likes to drink. Tonight was no exception. Bring on the whiskey.

Cue blackout. 
You know when you wake up from a night of heavy drinking and your memories are just flashes of pictures. You string them along creating a hazy timeline.

Picture:
Me stumbling down the stairs

""I'm hungry...""

Picture:
Me standing at the drive through window

""You need a car to use the drive through. We can't serve you.""

When I wake up after drinking way too much alcohol my consciousness comes in stages. First I became aware of my body. I'm uncomfortable and cold, why do I not have a blanket? What the fuck am I laying on?

A 35lbs weight. 

I open my eyes and see I'm sleeping on the ground and in what appears to be a weight room; I was sleeping next to the bench press. Things start churching in my disoriented, hungover mind as I started recognizing my surroundings, and I begin to panic. I was in my old bedroom! 

How the fuck did this happen!?!? I tried thinking of ways out of this. I put my head to the door and could hear voices. A male and a female. Can I climb out the window? No, that's a long fall. There was only one way out of this and I knew what I had to do. 

With my ear against the door I lightly knocked. I heard a gasp and a murmur. There was no turning back now. I opened the door and came out with my hands up. The new apartment owners were an asian couple in their mid 20s and the they were NOT very happy to see me.

I immediately tried to explain that I used to live here, I don't know how this happened, please don't call the cops or kick my ass. I told him I still had a key to the apartment as I was never told to turn it in and never bothered to take it off my keyring. I figured the locks would get changed. I gave him the key and he told me to empty my pockets to show I didn't steal anything. We were at a standstill, and he was seriously considering calling the cops.

And do you blame him!? Imagine that! Cooking breakfast with your significant other on a Sunday morning when some haggard looking stranger comes wallowing out of your weight room! How do you react to that?

He eventually let me go. He told me to never come back to that apartment complex. I agreed and left. I ran faster than i've ever ran. I must have ran a good mile before I stopped and called my friend to pick me up.

Apparently I told them I was going to get some food and never came back to the party. Turned my cellphone off and said fuck it.

non_PTSD,"Chargers fan stationed here at Fort Riley, KS. I've been planning on going to the game this weekend for sometime now. I have duty on Sunday but I'm having someone cover for me so I can go to the game. Mapquest says it's a 2.5 hour drive to the stadium (assuming that's without traffic).

It's kind of a broad question with many variables, but how long can I expect to be sitting in traffic before I hit the freeway? Assuming the game ends around 3pm, that gives me 3.5 hours to make the 2.5 hour drive. I can leave early if I have to, but I'm wondering if that will be necessary.

This is for myself.

My psychiatrist told me it would be good for me to put my thoughts down on paper.  Well, I don't have any paper. I guess this will have to do.

It's hard to imagine the feeling of coming home from a long day of work, opening the front door and finding your only son hanging from the upstairs banister. Blue in the face and cold to the touch. A chair knocked on its side under his dangling feet. He had worn the suit his father had given him before he passed away.

Cancer. 

He was never the same after that. I suppose he wanted to make a good impression, wherever he may end up. The EMTs would later find the letter he had written stashed away in his breast pocket. Coincidentally, the suit he was wearing at his death would be the same suit he would be buried in. 

He wanted an end to his suffering, and he found his cure. His suffering had ended, but in doing so he piled more onto his mother.

I hadn't talked to Robert in some time before his passing, and for that I blame myself. Things had changed between him and I, but I couldn't point my finger on exactly *what.* His father had passed away 4 months prior, and at the time he seemed more into isolation than anything else. In hindsight I should have known exactly what was going on in his head. How obvious it is now - years later - having thought about it day after day. What I should have done differently...

Blame.

Guilt.

Robert and I used to be inseparable, and his mother revered me as her other son. It was nice having a motherly figure in my life. My family life hadn't been stable for as long as I could remember, and often times we were left to fend for ourselves. I would come over and eat dinner with Robert and his Mother and Father nearly everyday, and for that hour or so at a time I felt like I actually had a family that loved me. 

There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about Robert's funeral. He was a fairly popular kid, and nearly our entire 8th grade class was there. Friends would take turns sharing anecdotes from times spent with Robert, laughing and crying all the while. Robert's mother had sat in the front row of the church, and there wasn't a single break in her sobs. I had tried to console her at one point, but she brushed me off. I was taken aback, but I figured she just needed her space. 

She composed herself momentarily and addressed the audience, thanking us for attending. She told us it meant a lot to her and that she had something to share with us. It was the note Robert had left. Through broken tears, this is what she read:

*Lately life hasn't been what it used to be. I don't find joy in anything I once did and everyday is a constant struggle. If you're reading this right now, I've lost that struggle. I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused you, and I hope that you can be strong without me. I've gone to be with Dad, and I hope to see you all when you get here. Love, Robert.*

She put the note down on the podium and reached for her purse. Pulling the metallic object and placing it to her head.

*Click*

*Boom*

* How do you generally like it there? For what it's worth i'll be PCSing to 4th brigade.

* Are there any establishments that are off limits? This may differ from unit to unit? The only thing that makes this assignment worth it to me is the night life and the big name artists that come through the various venues. 

* Do E-5s live in the barracks? How are the barracks? Mostly new? Mostly old? What i'm in right now were suppose to be condemned but we got a crazy influx of soldiers within the last year or so.. so here i am. 

* How big is the base? Google maps makes it look like a small COS.

* Are the civilian public receptive of soldiers on Fort Bliss? Where i am now is near a college town and civilians are constantly pushing our buttons because they know it's double jeopardy for us and most of the time there's no consequences for them.

I still have quite awhile till my report date. I may call Branch and see if i can get any other options. But, seeing as i don't have a sponsor yet, i figured i would reach out to reddit to see if i could get some guidance. ",Geloni

Siding with Mr. House is, in my mind, the best choice you can make in FO:NV. Why? He is the only person with a god damned plan that isn't just power. I just got done talking to Yes Man and was heading up to shoot Mr. House in the face with A Light in Shining Darkness, and decided to talk to him first. The man is so fucking charismatic and well written, and as soon as he shared his plan for humanities future I had to abandon my plan to kill him. 


> ""With all that money pouring in? Give me 20 years, and I'll reignite the high technology development sectors. 50 years, and I'll have people in orbit. 100 years, and my colony ships will be heading for the stars, to search for planets unpolluted by the wrath and folly of a bygone generation.""

Its those two quotes that basically changed my mind. He is the only choice that can see the big picture. He isnt just fighting for power or control, like the NCR or the Legion. He is playing the game to get humanity back up to speed, and then further. He is a dreamer with ambition. Vegas is best in his hands, at lest for the time being. Maybe sometime in the future he will have ran his course, but currently the world needs someone like him that can see the big picture.

Of course he is kind of a dick sometimes, and is okay with wiping out people if they stand in his way. But in the grand scale, is that really a bad thing?

I am studying abroad in Paris this year. It's already been a semester and I am having the time of my life. I have been trying to learn and practice my French while I am here because, well when in Rome...

Anyways I was feeling a little homesick the other day, missing my parents but my mom especially. Then a great idea hit me. She always used to make me this French dish for breakfast when I was young. It was basically an egg on toast. I think it's a pretty common thing? Well she always called it ""mer-dwa-so"" which I always just assumed meant ""egg on toast"" or some shit in French. Maybe I just assumed that was the name of the dish, like it didn't translate to anything. I guess I never really thought about it at all. Big mistake. 

I figured to myself ""hell this must be a French dish, and it will remind me of home. I'm going to go order it.""

So I went into a little café around from where I am staying and I went up to the lady, and in French asked her if they had any mer-dwa-so

You should have seen the look on her face. She basically just stared at me in disbelief and said what?

So I repeated it. 3 times. Until I realized that I was saying ""merde d'oiseaux"" which is literally bird shit. 

I left with no egg and toast. I called my mom and she explained to me, In-between fits of laughter, that they made that name up because it kind of looks like bird poop, spattered on a windshield (the toast). She said they translated it to French because it ""sounded fancier and because you can't say ""bird shit"" to a child every day.""

As we know from the Bible, Abraham was going to sacrifice his son, Isaac, to The Lord to prove his devotion. The game is obviously based on this. You play as Isaac, trying to escape your mothers crazed zealotry. She wants to sacrifice you to prove her loyalty. 

Just like the bible. 

The difference comes with the path you choose. 

Isaac from the bible chose submission, and The Lord eventually spared him from his intended fate. 

Isaac from our game chooses to fight and run. The Lord is no longer on our side, so who else to turn to?

It always starts off small. You need to be able to fight better to make it through, so maybe you get one upgrade, and it has a slight change in your appearance. 

But as it gets harder and harder you need more and more. Your ""treasure rooms"" are all bargains with the devil. Until eventually you are a monster. A demon.

> Proyecto de la investigación de estudiar el lenguaje español
> 
> 	Para mi proyecto, yo entrevistado una mejor amigo mío. Él l nació en Las estacas, municipio de Villamar, estado de Michoacán, México, y vive allí para una parte de su vida infancia. Cuando era niño, él fue a Los Estados Unidos, y el ha estado viviendo aquí para la mejoría tiempo de su vida. Aprendió Inglés como segunda lengua y como ha llegado a dominar por completo. Luego pasó a asistir a la universidad estatal de -name omitted- y obtuvo su licenciatura en Matemáticas. Él todavía visita México regularmente, para ver a los amigos y parientes. Él vive ahora en -name omitted- con su madre y hermanos. Es un comunicador muy sólido y una persona muy agradable estar cerca, en general, una conversación con él fácil. Su trabajo consiste en corregir problemas de palabras en inglés para una gran editorial de libros de texto y material didáctico, así que usa inglés todos los días. Anteriormente fue profesor de matemáticas, y se comunicó con hablantes de inglés todos los días. Él sabe Inglés tan bien o mejor que la mayoría de los hablantes nativos de inglés. Su madre sólo habla español y habla español en su casa, y está enseñando a su pequeño hermano, así como sus sobrinos y sobrinas español. En mi tiempo con él, he aprendido mucho español, y se centrará en la palabra del argot mexicano diptongo "" guey "" , así como la "" s "" vs "" c"" vs pronunciación "" z"" , y la pronunciación ""ll"".
> La primera característica que voy a examinar es el diptongo en la palabra "" guey "", que es la jerga mexicana para , básicamente, ""dude"" en Inglés . Si has seguido la pronunciación del libro ha presentado, sería pronunciado [Gwey ] . El U cambia a una W , ya que viene por primera vez en el diptongo . Esto es interesante, sin embargo, porque no es así como se pronuncia, al menos por mi amigo . Él y su familia usan la palabra todo el tiempo, y pronuncia simplemente como [camino ] . Veo esto como una prueba de que el lenguaje siempre está cambiando, y algunas palabras, especialmente argot, no voy a seguir las reglas. Tuvimos una muy larga conversación acerca de esta palabra, y la forma en que se escribía me confundió al principio.
> 
>La segunda característica que voy a examinar es su uso de la "" s "" vs "" c"" vs ""z"". En ciertas palabras como "" cerveza "", solía pronunciar [ser -be- za] . Nos bromear sobre la España pronunciación española y cómo utilizar el sonido ""th"" en lugar de la "" s "" suena bastante a menudo. En la mayoría de las palabras, su pronunciación de estas cartas seguiría las reglas del libro ha declarado. "" Corre "", con una ""k"" sonido duro , [ ko -RE ] . Hablamos mucho sobre esto, y le pregunté si podía pensar en ninguna palabra que no siguieron el método del libro había descrito. No podíamos pensar en ninguna. "" Veces "" se pronuncia [ ser - ses ] con él.
> 
>La tercera característica que voy a examinar es la pronunciación de la l sonido doble. Me siento como si esta es una de las características que cambian a menudo en función del país . Por ejemplo argentinos pronuncian la ""ll"" como una especie de sonido ""ch"" . Llamas del te de Como ? [ Ko- Mo-Te -ga- mas] . Mi amigo, sin embargo, la pronuncia como un sonido ""y"". Llamas del te de Como ? [ Ko- Mo-Te -ya- mas] . También a las 6:57 en mi video, mi entrevistado dice la palabra "" caballo“ que utiliza el mismo pronunciación .
> 
>Después de entrevistar a mi entrevistado, me di cuenta de algunas cosas. La primera es que la jerga no sigue las reglas de la pronunciación, que a pesar de que no me sorprende que aprender esto , me parece un poco obvio mirando hacia atrás , es algo que nunca he pensado . Mi entrevistado también dijo algo que me hizo pensar. Dijo que cuando se aprende un acento en español, por ejemplo, el español de México, usted será capaz de entender todos los otros acentos en su mayor parte. ""La diferencia es la misma en Inglés "", dijo. "" Su acento, vs un acento bostoniano, vs un acento del sur, frente a un acento Inglés, vs un acento australiano, etc. Usted puede pensar que suena un poco raro , pero casi siempre será capaz de entender lo que están diciendo. “nunca había pensado en eso antes y creo que es un muy buen punto. Tengo un poco para darse cuenta también que no existe una manera ""correcta "" de decir las cosas. El lenguaje es fluido y siempre cambiante.

**
Here is is in english, if there is any confusion about what I was trying to say**



> Paragraph 1
> For my project I interviewed an good friend of mine. He was born in las Estacas, municipio de villamar, estado de Michoacán, Mexico and lived there for a good portion of his childhood. When he was young he came to the United States and has been living here for the majority of the time since. He learned English as a second language and has since come to fully master it. He went on to attend Sacramento state college and obtained his bachelor’s degree in Mathematics. He still visits México regularly, to see friends and relatives. He lives now in Yuba City with his mother, and brothers. He is a very solid communicator and a very nice person to be around in general, making conversation with him easy. His work involves correcting English word problems for a large publisher of textbooks and learning materials, so he uses English every day. Previously he was a math teacher, and communicated with English speakers every day. In short, he knows English as well as or better than most native English speakers.  His mother speaks only Spanish and he speaks Spanish in his home, and is teaching his little brother, as well as his nephews and nieces Spanish. In my time with him, I have learned much Spanish, and will focus on the diptongo Mexican slang word “guey”, as well as the “s” vs “c” vs “z” pronunciation, and the “ll” pronunciation. 
> Paragraph 2
> The first characteristic I am going to examine is the diptongo in the word “guey” which is Mexican slang for basically “dude” in English. If you followed the pronunciation the book has laid out, it would be pronounced [Gwey]. The U changes to a W because it comes first in the Diptongo. This is interesting, however, because that is not how it is pronounced, at least by my friend. He and his family use the word all the time, and pronounce it simply as [way]. I see this as proof that language is always changing, and some words, especially slang, will not follow the rules. We had a pretty long conversation about this word, and the way it was spelled confused me at first. 
> Paragraph 3
> The second characteristic I am going to examine is his use of “s” vs “c” vs “z”. In certain words such as “cerveza” he would pronounce it [ser-be-za]. We would joke about the Spain Spanish pronunciation and how they use the “th” sound in place of the “s” sound quite often. In most words, his pronunciation of these letters would follow the rules the book has stated. “Corre” with a hard “k” sound, [ko- r̺e]. We spoke a lot on this, and I asked him if he could think of any words that did not follow the method the book had described. We could not think of any. “veces” would be pronounced [be-ses] with him.
> Paragraph 4
> The third characteristic I am going to examine is his pronunciation of the double l sound. I feel as though this is one of the characteristics which change often depending on country. For example Argentinians pronounce the “ll” as a sort of “ch” sound. Como te llamas? [Ko-mo-te-ga-mas]. My friend however, pronounces it as a “y” sound. Como te llamas? [Ko-mo-te-ya-mas].  Also at 6:57 in my video, my interviewee says the word “caballo”, which uses the same pronounciatiom.
> 
> Paragraph 5
> After interviewing my interviewee, I realized a few things. First is that slang does not follow rules of pronunciation, which even though I am not surprised to learn this, it seems a bit obvious looking back on it, it is something I have never thought about. My interviewee also said something that got me thinking. He said that when you learn one accent in Spanish, for example Mexican Spanish, you will be able to understand all other accents for the most part. “The difference is the same in English” he said. “Your accent, vs a bostonian accent, vs a southern accent, vs an English accent, vs an Australian accent, etc. You may think they sound a bit funny, but you will almost always be able to understand what they are saying.” I had never thought of that before and think it is a very good point. I have some to realize also that there is no “correct” way to say things. Language is fluid and always changing.

Es muy mórbido y miedo, especialmente cuando era joven. Hoy, no es miedo, yo sé que es nada más que cadáveres y ellos no son una amenaza. Hoy, you pienso cementerios están tranquila.",Mad_V

I know they are used in nuclear reactors and I know it has something to do with them deteriorating or something? And rods are put down to absorb the atoms breaking off and hitting each other, which causes heat and therefore is used to power steam turbines...? 


My understanding of them is very limited.


First of all, what is the difference between uranium and plutonium? They are both used in nuclear reactors right? Which one is better and why?


Do they produce different wastes? I always hear ""nuclear waste"" as a big broad term. What is that really?


How do you even find uranium or plutonium? I know they are elements but, many elements are almost never found in their natural state, eg. potassium. Do you mine it? Synthesize it?


Is it actually green? You always see nuclear waste or nuclear cells portrayed as bright glowing green. Is that actually how it is?


Was my explanation of nuclear power plants even close to correct? What actually goes on there?


Ive always heard that nuclear energy is actually really safe and efficient, but that so many people point to things like Fukushima and Chernobyl, and get scared. I know that once you actually start understanding things, they become less scary and you can approach discussion about them with a much more level head. So educate me, if you would be so kind Reddit.",Mad_V

I just got a new computer with the ability to actually run this smoothly, so I want to get back into it. So where to I go?",Mad_V

non_PTSD,"Wouldn't it be nice to be able to sync multiple tanks to each other, so when one action is given to one, all synced tanks do it at the same time, simultaneously?

For example it's such a pain trying to transfer fuel from two smaller outer tanks into one larger middle one. You always end up with one tank being more or less empty than its brother on the opposite side of your craft, causing uneven distribution of weight.

There's not a way to do this already? Is there? If not, does anyone else think this would be a nice feature?",Mad_V
