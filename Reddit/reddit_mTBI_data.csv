3zn5gc,TBI,"I suffered my TBI in October 2011 in a motorcycle accident. It was a closed head diffuse axonal injury that was categorized as severe. I was potentially headed to a nursing home for the rest of my life. Now, I am 28, 29 tomorrow (Jan 6). I had given up on college prior to the injury and had thought graduating from college was unrealistic after the accident. I graduated from The Fisher College of Business at The Ohio State University, a very reputable program. Don't give up."
3gbstq,TBI,"So, a lot of people wanted me to post the results of my first date with the woman who I met, that has a TBI. My original post is:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TBI/comments/3ftb1n/dating_a_woman_with_a_tbi_advicehelp_needed/

So, the date went very well. She was very guarded at first, but I expected that. We had some drinks and food, walked around a little bit, and she started to open up. She struggled with speaking. A lot of the time, she had to type it out on her phone and show me. I also had to read the menu to her because her vision is so poor. 

The only thing I could think of the entire time was how adorable she was. She was very shy, but opened up quite a bit. I thoroughly enjoyed the night. 

I'm very glad I stopped here to ask questions prior to my date. A lot of the advice you all gave me was very helpful and understanding the condition. It really did make a big difference. So again, I want to thank everyone who responded on the thread and PM'd me, you were all incredibly helpful. 

Cheers!"
3h3ke4,TBI,"In June, I returned to my job after being out for 7 months because of my TBI.  It has not been easy, but it is very satisfying to work again.  I say that as someone who has never generally been very hard-working or careerist.  I think I've learned a thing or two along the way about returning to work, so here's some advice:

**1. You will never feel ready to return to work** - After my injury, my line of thinking was ""I will return to work once I'm better.""  As we all know, the definition of ""better"" is likely to change throughout  recovery and healing is very much a seesawing process, with progress followed by setbacks.  When I decided to go back to work, my capabilities were still far under what I would have originally considered prerequisite for the tasks I had to do.  In the months since returning, however, my abilities have grown and grown.  This is not to say that you should return to work before it is medically safe to do so, only that you should not expect, or wait for, the day when you ""feel ready.""

**2.  Be upfront about your limitations** - Before I returned to work, I made sure that I was explicit about my condition and limitations with not only my immediate project manager, but everyone up the chain.  Since our injuries are largely invisible, it is important that we are clear and vocal about what we can and can't do.  Even after telling people initially, they will tend to forget.  It is our job to remind them.  Do not be ashamed about doing this.  

**3. Meet with coworkers in the weeks before your return date** - Returning to work after a long absence is naturally awkward.  That absence being precipitated by health problems makes it even worse.  People do not know how to interact with you or what to say, and you may find that you don't know either.  A lot of the stress associated with Day 1, however, can be alleviated by meeting with your coworkers before your actual start date.  I got lunch and coffee with a few colleagues and managers in the weeks leading up to my return.  This helped to make my eventual start date less stressful.

**4. Consider a stimulant** - I was originally against taking any kind of stimulant to help me function after my TBI.  I did not want to become dependent on drugs and felt that stimulants specifically would interfere with the healing process, which I understood to be sleeping as much as possible.  That said, I have been taking Ritalin since returning to work and find it very helpful.  Of course, this is something to discuss with your doctor.  

**5. Work only as much as you can** - I started working 5 hours a day in June and I am still working that amount.  This was the minimum acceptable amount of hours set by my firm.  Would they like it if I could work more?  Of course.  Do I let this bother me?  No.  5 is what I can do while still preserving my ability to function in the evenings and on weekends.  When I find that I have energy left over, I will add another daily hour.  Don't be ashamed or apologetic about your limitations!

**6. Disability was not a vacation** - In one of my lunch meetings leading up to the start of work, one of my managers joked that I ""can't take vacation for a year.""  This was a thoughtless comment, of course, but I did not let it upset me.  I actually took a vacation 1 month into my return, which had been planned for since before my injury.  You may feel compelled to be a martyr, to ""make up"" for your absence.  You don't owe that to anyone.  Your time on disability was NOT a vacation, and if you have the days, you should take them when you want.  

**7. You are changed** - Like most of you I'm sure, I am obsessed with the differences in myself caused by my TBI.  Almost nowhere will those differences be as obvious as in the workplace.  Not only will your purely negative changes be obvious, such as worsened memory, attention, fatigue and tolerance to stress, but more subtle and neutral changes may surface as well.  For example, I notice that I speak and act with much less of a filter now.  My doctors think this is either a result of my TBI or the experience of having one.  I actually like this new aspect of myself -- hopefully you find some changes to yourself are actually for the best as well.  

**8. You have power** - While you may feel very weak and small in returning to work, you have a tremendous amount of power. Yes, work is more difficult, but you have already survived something more traumatic and trying than whatever TPS report your manager is freaking out about.  Try to locate the power within yourself that comes from having survived something painful.  Try also to locate the power that comes from the fact that people are, indeed, rooting for you.  People generally want you to succeed, and if you're attuned to their emotions, that should be evident.  Finally, remember that the law is on your side.  Employers have to make reasonable accommodations for someone with a disability.  While I know this may not always happen in reality, any place with an HR department is going to know this full well and will be communicating it to your managers.  

That's all I've got for now.  I know this advice will not be applicable to all of you, so try to use your judgement as to whether these things are or will be true for you.  My injury may have been milder than yours, and my company may be particularly understanding. If anyone else has advice for returning to work, please share it.

Stay strong everybody."
41shy9,TBI,"I went riding since my TBI I had 2 years ago. I went last month and it was crazy difficult. I knew what I needed to do but it just wasn't happening. 

I went again last weekend and I finally was able to link some carves. I fell a lot, but as us skiers and riders say ""if you ain't falling, you ain't learning"". I got a gopro for xmas and used it to record one of the trails. 

I don't want any karma for it since it's probably not the coolest video out there, but I just want to share it with people that know what I've gone through for the most part. So, [here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QwaZ-C6KKA).

40ehrt,TBI,"ohhh the things lost in my memory or attention or Internet abilities....

Hello all. So I'm part of the crowd here, loved to find this subreddit.

Back in October of 2014 I was walking to a gas station and weirdly had a seizure (all the doctors found was a low sodium problem for God knows why, passed the alcohol and drug check). I hit my head severely bad. Not a normal fall, one where I went straight down on my skull. Someone saw and he called an ambulance (can't wait to find that guy!!!) and I was rushed in and had a brain surgery. I was bleeding bad in my head. One part of my skull was cut off and I sent away. Then they checked my head again and I was still bleeding, so they put me back in surgery and cut out another part of my skull. Then I ended up in a coma for about 2 weeks that the doctors told my parents that I might never wake up from, and even if I do I might never walk or speak again. I improved beyond expectation, but I was stuck in a wheelchair for a while and had a totally gone memory (barely even recognized my parents when they visited). 

Then I spent about 3 months in a hospital (in Austin, Texas), then was sent to a rehab unit for the next 2 months. Was finally released. Doctors said it would take 1.5 years to get better and I'm doing surprisingly well. My memory is still terrible and I'm a former literature major who can barely get through a book these days, but I think I can write and speak mostly normally. If you met me on the street, you wouldn't know I have brain problems unless you happened to ask me to name all the vegetables there are (I can only think of 3 types!!! At least a few months ago it was only one, heh. ONIONS!!!!).

I made a thread in the Austin subreddit if you want to read through it and see some posts in the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/3bc5xw/someone_called_the_ambulance_for_me_8_months_ago/

Happy to be here guys and girls and I wish you all the best of luck! Feel free to ask me any questions about recovery or anything else. I'm still in therapy. I have a psychologist and a speech therapist and they're both great and helping me a lot. I am in a way kind of am happy this happened. I made a living since college (I'm 31 years old) by playing a silly game online for a living, but now I'm getting a real job and joining the real world with plans to improve my social skills and happiness.

Wish you all the best!

3sfyd8,TBI,"     Though several years have passed since my brain injury, I have finally found a job that is seeming to ""stick"" and with which I am successful!  I don't know if anyone else has had problems finding the right fit of employment after attaining a brain injury, but I have been through several jobs since.  Having a degree in something completely unrelated has merely given me the confidence to succeed with what I am doing currently.  
     I am finding myself to be much more ""open"" to strangers and easier to talk to.  I can now, I believe due to my experiences with TBI, open up to people about random ideas and subjects.  I find myself to be much more patient with others and am able to explain subject matter related to my job very easily to them.  I have, in turn, been rewarded several times and received a lot of  recognition for the job I am able to perform.
   I am merely explaining this as proof that things to in-fact ""get better"" after Traumatic Brain Injury.  This is only a stepping-stone to who you are and whom you will become.  I am discovering new abilities I have all the time and am utilizing them the best ways I can.  In closing, my advice is to simply look at this experience as a positive one from which you may learn.  My TBI is a God-given gift from which I plan to take advantage of fully and continue from which to learn!"

1tsy4l,TBI,Had a TBI last year and would like to talk with someone who can relate
3hmidr,TBI,"     Having sustained a Traumatic Brain Injury in the spring of 2002 as the result of a roll-over car accident and being ejected from a Chevy Tahoe traveling at around eighty miles-per hour, I want to feel ""mostly if not all the way"" recovered and back to normal.  Although I may never return to exactly the way I was pre-accident, I'd like to pretend that I'm well on my way!  A recent question I've pondered recently; ""Do I WANT to be the old me?"" really gets me thinking about who I was and what I believed.  Has my self-worth actually increased (on a personal level)?  Would I have been motivated to make some of the same accomplishments I've made since then?   

     After having been affiliated with ""reddit TBI"" for several weeks now, I'm starting to feel better and more positive about my situation.  I've been doing some ""self-meditation"", so to speak, and am attributing many of my successes at work, with other people, and life in general not only to my ability to persevere and overcome adversity but to my time spent here sharing my story and hearing from others like me!  For quite some time I couldn't help but feeling, like I'm sure many other TBI sustainers feel, does anyone else feel this way and understand the ""bullshit"" and weird ways of thinking I do?  Feeling alone or misguided aren't really clear-cut ways to explain emotions I've experienced through this, but they definitely come close!  At times throughout my recovery I almost want to explain as if I've had out-of-body experiences, watching myself rediscover and learn about the world around me.  It's almost been invaluable for me to share things with others and hear about people, other than me, rediscovering themselves as well!  This is a strange ""journey"" we've all embarked upon, but we will all gain hope and encouragement to surpass our troubles!

     I guess the main point of this post is to get others' reactions and ideals about what this web-based portal means to people like me.  Has anyone found the same value in being able to share experiences, feelings, fears, etc.. as I have.  I feel as though this experience and ability to communicate so personally with people who've gone through situations very similar to mine has been extremely helpful and positive for me!  I no longer feel alone and scared in a barren land or life in general.  Several abilities I had have been only heightened or perfected, as I'm sure many of yours will.  In closing, remember that we can and WILL all overcome this slight road-block and will return to, if not surpass, our desired state of cognition and understanding.  (I used the term ""slight"" in my previous sentence very loosely as I'm well aware there is absolutely nothing slight or miniscule about Traumatic Brain Injury!  This is very serious business.)  Please pass along your thoughts on what this has done for you and for others, and encourage others to take advantage of this ""invaluable"" online resource.  We must make ourselves heard and truly understand what TBI is!"

2hlj8a,TBI,"These statements and many more like them are hard for me. I feel like they are dismissing what I am really going through. I don't feel great and I am not doing great. I try not to focus on it but my processing speeds are slow, my vision is doubled, my sense of time is gone, fatigue is huge, focussing is brutal. I could go on but you guys get it. 

I am giving it all I have got. It is taking everything I have. I don't have enough but I have more than I did a year ago. I am grateful for where I am, don't get me wrong.

There other day I saw a post on Reddit a kid made a sign or something that said adults are weird because they ask you how you are but only want to hear that you are great. It's true.

I had another point that I was wanting to put on here that I can't remember. Oh the joys. Now fast someone try and make me feel better by telling me that happens to you and you don't even have a TBI.

24htie,TBI,"I was in an automobile accident three years ago, and suffered a TBI. Having grown up in an abusive and torturous environment, concussions were an old friend of mine and I quickly learned to reprogram my brain and keep going, from an early age. 

But this...this was different, and terrifying. I told myself the memory lapses were just the pain medication they had given me for my injuries. I told myself that I just needed to rest. I told myself that it would get better, and weaned myself off of the pain medication, only taking it when I couldn't stand the pain in my back/hip. 

I lived alone, so it took me a while to realize all of my symptoms. I couldn't write my own name or even the alphabet; had issues with rounded letters especially. My head ached when I tried to remember something, anything. I had tremors so bad that I had trouble feeding myself because my hands would just fling the food off of the fork/spoon. I sometimes forgot how to swallow that food, and would choke. I had reccuring episodes of syncope, and would wake up on the floor. I had memory lapses that were horrifying: one minute I would be in the room with a visiting friend, and the next they would be gone and I had no memory of how/when they had left, or what we had discussed. I would find myself on a walk alone late at night, with no memory of leaving my house. I didn't know what day it was, or remember the last time I had tended to hygiene or eaten. I had wicked migraines, that tended to come with double or blurry vision. An opera of ringing would torment my ears. Bright lights and loud sounds were absolutely unbearable, and I began to be afraid of even leaving my apartment. I could not control my ability to laugh or cry, and would create inappropriate and awkward moments. I was angry, so angry, and felt unable to control my emotions. The worst was that I began to forget that people existed, or what they looked like-even family members. 

I also had no insurance. It was just me, and the diagnosis from the ER doctor, who in my opinion, should have done more than tossing me two prescriptions and sending me on my way into the great unknown. 

I still have no insurance. That's okay though...I'm a smart girl and am certainly no victim. I'm stubborn, so I decided to tackle it as best that I could. 

I began with writing my ABC's/123's for hours, between fatigue naps. I gave myself a daily exercising of choosing three words to remember for the next day. I enlisted friends who I trusted to give me a phrase to remember, or to come stay with me and tell me stories of our time together. I wrote lists and posted them everywhere in my apartment: ""Hey, did you brush your teeth?"" and ""Have you eaten today?"". I researched and read everything I could get my hands on about TBI and treatments until my brain literally ached. I pushed myself, everyday...but also learned to be patient with myself. I slowed down and put conscious thought into chewing and swallowing, even breathing. I learned coping mechanisms like distracting someone I was speaking to when my face would seize up or I would trip over words. (Magician's tricks were the most helpful with this.) 

I did everything I could think of to get better, and even to hide my issue. I was (and still am) afraid that some people would take advantage of me. Some people did anyway, and now my condition is a secret that only a few people close to me even know. 

I'm getting better, but there is still so far to go. One of the worst things is realizing that I had to give myself the opportunity to mourn who I used to be. I am still me, but I am not my former self. This has been the hardest part, and something that I am still actively trying to overcome. 

But...there's hope in that as well, yeah? In a way, we've been given an opportunity to reinvent ourselves, to disconnect from the bad habits and former behaviors. Sure, it comes at the cost of seizures, tremors, frustration, hopelessness, depression, loss of friends/family, and some really heavy stuff. 

Maybe I am crazy, but I find that those things are not as difficult if I focus on the silver lining of a new beginning, a new perspective. The above-listed items make me (and others) miserable, but in a way I feel like my injury has made me a better person than that ""former self"". 

I slow down now. I appreciate the simple act of being alive. I celebrate little victories, like remembering to eat, shower, and brush my teeth or form simple sentences. So many people take these things for granted, but we-we know how important they really are. And though cynicism likes to try to rear its ugly head in moments of frustration, I have found that my ""new self"" has a much better sense of humor, since she sees the beauty in being alive. 

I don't know what my point is exactly. I suppose you'll understand that my train of thought tends to run off of the tracks sometimes. 

I guess what I am trying to say is that all is not lost, and there is still so much hope in focusing on what we have gained in the process of dealing with TBI. 

It is so incredibly difficult at times, I know. Feeling like a toddler at thirty-two is enough to make anyone want to just give up. I almost did, more times than I'd like to admit. I felt like everyone would be better off not having to know me or deal with me. Not having the gall to commit actual suicide, I committed social suicide instead. For the last six months, I have only left my house to visit the grocery store, late at night when only the employees are there. 

There was one exception last week that changed everything: I went on a walk with an old schoolmate around the lake. The dam in my head broke, and I confessed it all. I spoke openly about what the last three years have been like. Color me confused when instead of balking, he was taken aback and commented on my strength. 

It hit me like a ton of bricks. ""Strength? No, no..you don't understand. I am weaker now, dumber, slower, less coordinated."" 

I sat in silence after I arrived home, mulling the whole thing over. You know what guys? He was right. We are strong. We are capable of overcoming this. We get better every day. Maybe we just have to let go of who we used to be, learn to measure the little victories so that we realize how big they are, compared to where we started. 

I am still not sure why I typed this all out. Maybe just spilling it out of my brain will help me. Maybe the familiarity will help you. Because in the end, even if you are like me and have very few people you can trust-you are not alone, and neither am I. We are not hopeless. We will get better, because well-we already have, yeah? 

Thank you for taking the time to read my gibberish. "
3zewrv,TBI,
3kmdaw,TBI,"      Hello, I am new to this subreddit. Before my brain injury I used to always come to reddit to pass the time in between my classes at Chico State University. I never thought to look for a TBI subreddit until now. I want to go to TBI support groups but I lost my drivers license, and it would take me a long time to get there on the bus. I thought it would be good to communicate with other people that have TBI, because a lot of my friends do not understand how difficult this is for me. Luckily, my family and friends have helped with everything and I am grateful for all of them. But, my therapist also said to speak with other people that have have had of this injury.  
    With that in mind I want to communicate with others, hopefully some of you can give me advice. A few weeks ago I started to take classes at San Jose State University. I transferred to it because it is closer to my parents house. My family and friends have helped with everything and I am grateful for all of them. Otherwise this difficult situation would be that much tougher for my family and myself. I am only taking two classes right now and I have an appointment with the accessible education center in a couple weeks. They will help me to adjust to my classes i.e. more time for assignments, and quiet spaces to take exams. It was their first available appointment otherwise I would have had it as soon as I could.  
  My injury, I was in a car accident in January of this year when I was on break from school. I sustained a DAI and I was in the hospital for a month, the hospital cleared me to leave but, then I was transferred to therapy. I have been in therapy ever since but insurance has been cutting my therapy down. Currently, I am in therapy on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Monday and Wednesday I go to school at San Jose State. I have changed since my accident, but I know that I will continue to change as time progresses. I am just glad to still be alive and I found this subreddit to communicate with others. I am open to any advice, support, and anything you want to say. "
3jmjbc,TBI,"     My take on life (and entire perspective on life now) is that it is too short to let obstacles, such as a brain injury define who you are or control life's every 'turn'.  The one little bit of advice I can give to others like me whom are overcoming TBI is to find a new OUTLET or activity in life that makes you feel good about yourself.  Mine has been exercise, more specifically long-distance running, and my life thus far has changed drastically.  Not only do I feel better about who I am and my accomplishments but I seem to perform well at work with this new attitude, get along better with others and can explain myself more clearly to those around me.  
     I would definitely recommend finding that outlet out there to almost be completely consumed in.  Finding this outlet has  enabled me to enjoy my life a lot more, just by having more positive feelings about myself!  Try picking up an old hobby or finding a new one, but I promise can and will change your attitude about things you may or not be able to do.  I am partaking in my second Half-Marathon in a couple weeks, and having that goal has really given me extra encouragement and motivation to work hard and overcome any obstacles this TBI has given me!  Good luck to everyone fighting this ""battle"" within yourself, and I hope everyone is able to find something that gives them some purpose (other than surviving) in life to make themselves great and find happiness with who they are! "
2igoer,TBI,"The American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology are launching a new subspecialty, Brain Injury Medicine.  The first examination was given today (October 6, 2014), so we should be seeing doctors with specific qualifications in TBI issues before the end of the year.  I hope everyone here who is having problems from their TBI can find a physician who can help them as much as possible.  "
2cv2bg,TBI,"Since my TBI six years ago, I have come up with a theory that seems to hold some water. I call it the ""Estranged Uncle Syndrome"" because everyone has or knows an uncle who suddenly stopped talking to everyone and totally isolated himself. I am that uncle.

I believe that brain injuries are much more common than most people believe. I was hit by a car in 1971, when I was eight years old. I was unconscious until the police arrived, but instead of being taken to the hospital, I was driven home by a nice policeman. Because I was young, and people thought our skulls served as some sort of functional helmet, the incident was never connected to the following years of academic failure and general fucked-upness. The fact that I had suffered a concussion was never even discussed until 2012, when my more recent injury was diagnosed.

Is it a coincidence that football players, who bash their bodies together, tend to also be aggressive and mentally slow? It starts in high school, and by the time they get to college, they can't pass a test. This doesn't seem to happen to other athletes in sports with less contact. But it does seem to be true for violent sports. The effect is much clearer in boxing. Brain injuries, but not diagnosed as such. 

Abused children, or at least those who are beaten, must suffer the effects, and often wind up as violent failures. How many brain injuries are ignored as the psychological symptoms of abuse?

A majority of homeless men and men in jail suffered a TBI before becoming homeless or going to jail. Same with boys in juvenile detention. Many came from violent households. Maybe the cycle of violence is because of brain injuries being passed on from generation to generation.

Who knows? Maybe some of the syndromes we see today, like ADD and even Autism, which have no biological marker, are from minor brain injuries suffered during infancy.

Getting knocked out is a lot more serious than people think it is. The brain is so delicate, every blow changes it a little bit. The changes can be gradual, or they can be sudden, but the damage is done.
"
27grnr,TBI,"So yeah, I fell from a second story railing at a friend's (Apparently I started sitting there in the early Summer of last year, when my memory started going completely) at a ""last party before college"" thing with the same 5 people usually there (well 1 couldn't). 

I went into a coma in August (20) and came out in October. Right now, I'm doing rehab & the rec center for exercise. It's helping just a bit. 

I miss walking & using my right (main) arm. I'm suicidal.

Edit: I don't expect anyone to read this or care. I know a lot of people have it worse than me."
23866x,TBI,"My sister was in a car accident at the end of March, and she was in a coma.  She has severe TBI and has recently started opening her eyes and trying to communicate, but she can't because she had a tracheostomy. 

I've been looking for people who have had similar experiences, but I can't seem to find anything like this.

She is awake and somewhat responsive (will stick out her tongue if you ask her to) and it seems like she's trying to talk.

Her arms are strapped to the bed because her whole body is thrashing around and she keeps trying to rip out her feeding tubes and her trach.

She is constantly in motion, and seems so angry. Every once in a while she will smile, but it's fleeting.  She is in diapers and the nurses have gloves (big, like boxing gloves) on her hands to avoid her harming herself. 

Her body is covered in bruises, not from the accident, but from the constant thrashing motions.  It's honestly like watching a scene from The Walking Dead.

She was initially a GCS of 6, and now is at a 9T (9 and intubated)

Does anyone have advice on how to cope with watching someone going through so much pain?  I feel like keeping her on life support might not have been the best choice... but it wasn't mine to make. 

I guess I'm having issues seeing how this is ""in her best interest"", and can't shake the feeling that things aren't going to get better.

Sorry if this is all over the place.  I feel like I have nowhere to turn, as my family wants to keep a lot of this information private.

1: When I was 13 years old. A friend and I were out enjoying biking, like all good young teen boys do. We were being silly, popping wheelies, jumping off our bikes. The usual. I was riding along an alleyway and I approached this ledge. I wanted to jump it, because you know THAT WOULD BE COOL! But I misjudged the height (about 4ft) and my speed. My bicycle went half over, front wheel first, and I flew off my bike, Landing straight down on my head. Helmet shattered (probably saved my life), But the pain was still immense. My head, Neck, back, chest, all felt caved in. To this day, still the only time I remember calling someone and saying ""take me to the hospital please"". Was not diagnoised with much other than ""you're lucky to be alive"" by the hospital. Prescribed muscle relaxants and a lot of painkillers, and spent the next few weeks in bed

2: Fast Forward a half dozen years. 19 year old at a Rob Zombie concerts.. Because, you know. Mosh pits are cool! Everything seemed fine till THWUMP. Pain, darkness and diziness.. Someone landed right on my head. DIdn't think much of it at first, but headaches persisted, But they eventually subsided. Of course, the word ""concussion"" didn't seem to exist in my vocabulary at the time.

3: a few more years later, I started playing ice hockey. Now in my 20's, I wasn't very good, But I had to keep at it. Was playing in a friendly houseleague (or so I thought) in my hometown. I made a diving play, slid behind the net, and started to stand up. Well the guy I stopped was bitter, and skated right through behind me, knee first into the back of my skull. Helped off the ice, head spinning. This is the first time it ever occured to me, wait somethings not right. My sister was watching the game and immediately ""You've got a concussion!"". I didnt think much of it. head hurting, ""Ive felt this before, its not like i'm crippled or anything"". next few days I was constantly exhausted, headaches, dizzyness, didn't even know that my sister was waking me up every couple hours during the night. Had no memory of that at all

4: Skiing with my Cousins. It had been a couple years, But I felt great! it was like riding a bike! Cousin made a joke ""I bet you can still do jumps, I dare you""... OH of course, I couldn't resist such comment. ""What could go wrong"". Famous last words I guess. Got airborne before I remembered, that I forgot how to land. Landed hard on my feet, Knees buckled, head whipped backwards and THWUMP off the ground. Vision went white for about 5 minutes as I sat there on the ground, unable to see, and hearing people around me yelling ""ARE YOU OK?!!?"". I just remember lookin up a the ski lift, and seeing most people wearing helmets, and thinking ""Helmet, Oh, Hey, that would be a good idea while skiing"" (when I grew up skiing, ther really weren't helmets). Took one more slow run down the bunny hill when it hit me that something was reallly not right. Comparatively to my other bumps to my head, this one was absolutely feeling a lo worse than ever. After Doc visit, Rest for months. Back to working out. Life went one.

5: a few years later, I'm playing Ice hocke again. Now a goalie, and actually doing very well, As an adult progressed from learning the position to playing men's A league. Sho comes in, I smother it, and bam, right to the top of my head, player comes crashing into me. right into my head. I have that moment of ""White"" vision again. Shake my head a few times, and, the game goes on. I'm feeling weird. Logic is gone. 

5.5: Game continues, I'm clearly not making wise decisions, but I guess I didnt know that then. PLay went behind the net, I backed up to the cross bar, but bent to low. My head is about 10cm in front of the bar when a fight broke out behind the net, and they shoved the net hard. The net striked the back of my head (skull plate probably prevented a skull fracture), and next thing I realize I am laying face down, on the ice, with the net firmly laying accross the back of my head. My team is to busy arguing with the ref over a call. THe other team comes and helps me up! Ref comes over ""are you ok"", I stand up, fall down, Stand up again, fall back down. finally 3rd time, I'm on my skates again. ""I'm ok""... Seriously, I said that. I know I said it. I remember saying it. But then the rest of the game is a blur. Game ends 15-1, we lose, I could have sworn we were up 1-0. I sit in the dressing room for 45 minutes before I can start to change. Next thing I realize, I'm 2 hours driving from home. Lost. What should have been a 5 minute drive, with 2 turns, has me in the middle of nowhere. I turned around, Called my dad and had him take me right to a Doctor

those two in one hour period were the hardest thing I've ever recovered from.  Months of seeing a sports doctor, going to physiotherapy, and rehabing in the gym, I finally return to play pickup hockey with some good old timer friends. 3 weeks of playing, and My vision started randomly blacking out again one game. Get a lift from one of the hockey guys to the doc. Back to rehab.

6: Few years later, i'm doing well, Back to shape again. Back to playing hockey (Although I've given up higher level leagues at this point, now playing lowest friendly pickup games). And I sliipped in the shower. Smacked the back of my head off the wall. 6 months on the shelf again.

Sort of 7? About 4 years ago, I went to disneyworld with the nieces. Went on a ride in epcot called Mission Space. Didnt even hit my head. Months of Post concussion symptoms. Dizzyness. Nausea and vomiting before I feel normal again

7: Rewind to Last april. Hockey (AGAIN, I seriously think i'm done playing forever now). Not as a goalie, just casual low level with some beginners. How dangerous could that be. Well, when the other guy doesn't know how to skate, doesnt' matter how well I can. Beginner gets right in front of me. Stops, and freaks out, drops his shoulder, which I skated my head directly into. I knew I was fucked at this point. just sat there in the ice in pain. Got up. Skated to the doors to leave the ice. swore, then sat down on the bench and then jumped on for my next shift... Wait a minute, I thought I went ot the dressing room! 

Went back through the doctors, Rehab, had a bit of a heart scare in there, back to the gym low key, went for a casual skate and immediately got dizzy and haven't even tried working out since then. All the family doctors i've gone to have said the same thing ""rest"". Can't get an MRI, cant get anything. I'm exhausted non stop, I wake up at 6am every morning absolutely more tired than when i went to bed at 8pm. All I do now is eat, sleep and go to work. By the end of the day, my head is aching, my eyes are watering, and I struggle just to keep my eyes open. When I sleep I feel conscious throughout constant nightmares. Work is absolutely starting to pass me by. I'm in the tech field, and I can't keep up at all anymore. I feel like I'm obsoleted by kids 10 years younger than me, and I just can't retain anything new (Or a lot of the stuff I once knew either). 

Thankfully, My logic hasn't failed me for work yet and I am squeaking by. But I know it's only a matter of time before I'm completely lost. 

Emotionally, I'm a wreck. I've always suffered from depression, which seeing my history of head injuries makes sense, but with the inability to go out and do stuff, And the constant exhaustion, I've just about lost all my friends (they've moved on with their lives, and most of them were through hockey). I can't hold a relationship down. I can't get up to go even meet new people withou't being overwhelmed with anxiety and insane panic attacks. And honestly it feels like everything is snowballing down hill.

And at the end of the day, All i can think to myself is, What do I need to do. Who do I need to see, Who the hell can I talk to, Because I want to feel better. I KNOW i can feel better. There has to be something someone can help me with. But I don't even know where to start. My General Practictioner has been a joke and I've told him to fuck off. I've been told by most of the clinics for rehab and brain injuries, that unless I've been admitted to the hospital recently for injury they can't help me. I feel utterly lost. And many people don't understand it. They dn't see a cast, or crutches so I don't think they relate or understand. 

Sorry for the long rant. But /r/tbi, as others who have suffered similar, What did you do? what should I do next? I'm not sure where to even start. The Last doctor I did get to help, has closed practice and there are now condo's where his office used to be.

I'm in the Toronto Area if that matters. Would love to be pointed in the right direction.

Thank You"
4206f8,TBI,"Hi there, since an accident with a TBI two and a half years ago, I´ve been suffering from sleep disorders. I wake up at least seven times a night and feel like shit in the morning. Do you have any ideas what I could do against that? What has helped you to cope with sleep disorders ?"
410w7w,TBI,"While I was in the service, I was thrown by a blast. I have a documented case of mild to moderate TBI; nothing overly serious. I have migraines from time to time, and a real tough time sleeping. Recently my memory has been starting to go. Little things, like I can't remember putting up Christmas lights, I've gone inside my house with the car still running, and names of people I see every day seem to always be right on the tip of my tongue. The incident was almost 7 years ago. Is it normal for memory to start slipping this long after the fact? It has caused a rift between my wife and I. We are expecting our first baby in March and she is worried about leaving me alone with it(we're keeping the sex a surprise) for long periods of time. I know I should talk to my health care provider, but I just want to get other people's take on the situation. "
3tbqkw,TBI,"Better than a month late, but I'm still kicking myself. The embarrassment of having taken the day off, paying to park, and realizing I'd psyched myself up for nothing is bad. Worse still is having to wait another month. The true twist - not being able to keep my calendar straight is one of my lingering concussion issues, that I'm looking for help in at cognitive rehab.  

/frustration"
3kfvww,TBI,
3ftb1n,TBI,"So, I was talking to a young woman recently and asked her on a date. Everything up until this point, I had no clue she had a TBI, but she did tell me a little bit about it before we ended that conversation. 

She was in a car accident back in 2008, struggled to walk, talk and function as she had prior to. Since then she's made tremendous strides to regain most of what she had lost due to her TBI. I've only texted her, haven't really spoken to her, so I don't know if her TBI affects her speech or if she has any communication issues. 

Currently, all I know is that she can not legally drive due to her vision issues. She goes to the gym regularly and has been working on getting back to school. She seems smart and we go back and forth flirting quite a bit, so socially she at least seems to me that she's relatively unaffected by her injury. 

My main concern is that she said she needed to talk to me about her condition more prior to our first date (this weekend). I assured her that I wasn't going to be disinterested in her regardless of what she had to say because I'd already gotten to see her personality and I still wanted to take her out.

I'm just nervous really, that I don't know a lot about this sort of thing and I want to be knowledgeable, or at least as knowledgeable as I can be in the next 3-4 days, about this sort of thing. What advice do you guys have for me? Should I ask her outright about her injury prior to the first date? Or give her time and space, so that she's comfortable while communicating her condition with me? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
3emwu8,TBI,"About 3 years ago, I was injured in a car accident which I walked away from and assumed that everything was fine. 

About 2 to 3 weeks after the car accident, sleep began to become progressively more difficult for me. After several weeks, I dropped into a period of getting about 45 minutes of sleep a night. With a lack of sleep, an old epilepsy diagnosis came roaring its angry head with a vengeance and I began having significant aura activity. At first, it was just light dejavue and moments of panic, but it quickly grew into intense auras like I had never experienced before. 

My primary doctor tried to put a bandaid on the situation, prescribing ambien, then lorazepam, diazepam and clonazepam. After exceeding 4 times the original dosing to get an extra half an hour to 45 minutes of sleep, I began looking at other means to address my sleep issues. 

After about a month of only getting about 45 minutes a night, and many nights of going without, the slight headaches I had after the accident progressed into full blown migraines, followed by an even more intense increase in seizure activity. 

My medical care became a series of throwing anti-seizure med after anti-seizure med at me, first with Lamictal, then Keppra, Depakote, Zonegran, Trileptal, Dilantin and Topamax. After many failed attempts to end my auras and seizures, my 'specialist' almost talked me into a VNS, however, after looking up their kickbacks from Cyberonics, I decided that it was time to look elsewhere for medical care. 

My migraines resulted in a weekly regimen of Sumavel injections, 4 times a week for well over a year, which again was just a bandaid, but allowed me to function, however, as the weeks became months and the months encroached into a year post injury, I still continued to struggle with sleep and was still averaging less than 45 minutes a night and many nights, no sleep at night. I tried Trazadone and Tizanidine, Norco, Oxy and many others, but got to a point where addiction and suicidality from post TBI depression were becoming significant concerns.  

I continued to slide further into a non-functional state, often missing time from work because of fear an aura might turn into a full blown seizure or fear that I might fall asleep for a few seconds, which would result in immediate termination of employment. My short term memory was the first to go, then my long term began to blur and somewhat fade. My concept of time slipped into a state in which I didn't know what day it was or what time it was and relied solely on my phone for daily reminders for things as simple as when to take medications, when to leave for work and what appointments I had for the day, functions which were all easily recalled from memory before. 

A little over a year after the injury, I went approximately 177 hours without sleep. I talked with my doctors and was given an option of ""deal with it"" or ""we can put you in a temporary chemical coma... but given your brain's abnormal function right now, we are not sure how well you will come out of it"" response. 

I opted to take control of my life, moved into doing my own research and eventually made a step toward a non-traditional route of care and got a medical marijuana card. Through the use of tinctures, oils and edibles, my life improved significantly. My memory still remained an issue, and while sleep and migraines greatly improved, my mood went out the window. I quickly became very angry, easily agitated, and overall felt that I was loosing control over my life. 

I fell into a period of life where basic functions like brushing my teeth, taking my meds, bathing regularly, etc. became a major issue. Depression began to rule over my life and I fell into such a deep hole that eventually my partner asked to add a third to our relationship, and eventually ended leaving me for her (whole other story, some what related, but in many regards not). 

Today, I try to make the best of my life, I try to be the best person I can, knowing very well that I can't do things the way I once did, and that in many regards I am having to relearn to live in a different way all over again. Depression still has a strong hold on me and I often struggle with alcoholism. I am slowly getting life under control, but realize that life as I once enjoyed it will never be again. I have changed as a person, mostly for what I consider the worse, but also realize that all in all, I have had it pretty easy and overall, nothing compared to some I know with TBIs that have completely physically changed their lives. 

I still try to stay strong and consider myself fortunate, but at times struggle with the day to day aftermath that comes with having a TBI almost 3 years ago.

3b6hap,TBI,"It's been 1 month since I received a TBI in a car accident. It's been an extremely frustrating, confusing, and blank, month. I was given an RX for glasses which has really helped my non-active headaches. Still getting severe headaches with any activity. Since I've been home alone for a month, I haven't had much face to face interaction, but the other day I went out for lunch with a couple friends and realized I couldn't participate in conversation. That's had me worried...I hope it gets better in time.  I feel really drawn to things like puzzles right now. I was wondering if anybody had anything to suggest or donate that helped them with working out their brains. Also, I just discovered this sub, so I plan on being very active. I read a couple posts that made me tear up...It makes me feel better knowing that other people know what I'm going through."
2i0c3x,TBI,I'm a couple years into it but for the life of me I can't buy grocerys.  I walk into a grocery store get overwhelmed and leave with just a gallon of milk.  I  mostly go out to eat but that is neither healthy or financially a good idea.
2hi8s0,TBI,"I have been lurking here for about a month. I've read every post . I want to thank you all for being here. One year ago I got what every parent fears but never think it would happen to them. The knock on the door at 3:30 in the morning. My 18 year old son swerved to avoid a deer and struck a tree on his way home from work. We got extremely lucky that someone saw him and told police who were just a couple of miles away. An ambulance that was called off one call was also very close within the hour he was in surgery. A few hours later he was out ,missing the left side of his skull,and in a coma ,but out of surgery. He spent the next twenty days like that. I never left his side. I will never forget when he gave that first thumbs up. I cried for hours. His recovery was up and down in the begining. He had a punctured lung a fractured sacrum and a tbi. He developed. Hydrocephalus and had to have a shunt installed. It drives him nuts. He is extremely lucky and has recovered incredibly. But still has I won't say a lot he's probably going to read this so some issues. Memory issues, fatigue, and a few more he doesn't think I know about. It is nothing that he won't adapt to. We got lucky.
 This sub, the people here you guys have let me know that I'm not crazy. You have helped me so much in understanding what my son has been going thru. Most people don't understand what TBI is. They think since you look fine that you are fine and that is far from the truth. When he was in the coma everyone was afraid that he wouldn't wake up. I was just scared of what he would be when he did. The doctors always seem to give worse case scenario they aren't much comfort in these type of situations as you already know. They were all wrong. 
 My sons life changed forever at 3:30 am one year ago almost to the minute.  It isn't the big deal that the docs make it out to be. They kind of make you feel like there will be some sense of normalcy when it finally comes but there isn't.  We will learn. We will hope. We will go on but most importantly he will have a life it just won't be the one he had and that's OK. I guess I'm just rambling now. I apologize for the grammer. I just needed to say thank you."
2fwpf4,TBI,"I had my brain injury last winter. It was pretty bad given the circumstances. I came around in the spring and came home in the summer.

All my friends stopped talking to me. I try to text to see if they want to hang out or something but nothing. I spend all my time at home, doctor appointments, PT/OT/ST and other therapies... but that's the only time I'm out and about.

I don't really know why everyone stopped talking to me, but my guess would be my speech, personality and being unable to walk that great. I don't know how to make friends anymore.

Any advice?"
29fych,TBI,"My wife was hit a by a car while jogging over a year ago. Luckily she survive but really rattle her skull. Its been a long road and she has made progress but she is not there yet. She was always tough, and she keeps her problems, for better or worse, to herself. But she has sort of bunkered herself emotionally recently. Her progress has stalled, I know its driving her nuts but she doesn't respond to anything. But we have reached to point where we are no longer talking. Issues bubble up, I make my points about her unwillingness to compromise but its all attacks on her according to her. It's destroying our relationship (we have been married 21 years). I know her well enough to recognize that this is a defensive response with her but I can't make any progress with her, in the mean time I'm losing it. I'm alone, she seems unreasonable and unwilling to even consider my requests. We have 2 kids and many of my concerns revolve around them. But I am just wrong, always, according to her. I fear this is all falling apart, after everything we have gone through I can no longer speak to her. I am severely worried about our family and I just don't even know where to begin any longer. Any help would be appreciated. 
"
257kw6,TBI,"Roughly six months after I sustained my TBI. No more physical therapy, speech therapy, or anything for me. I'm still reteaching myself a number of things I took for granted, I guess. Such as walking, eating, or cognitive attributes. I was getting a little overwhelmed with all the appointments so I'm kind of happy I no longer have to go here and there every other day. I keep having to answer questions that seem repetitive, so I usually answer in the same manor now. Something along the line of: ""you had to be there"" or I'll just blame it on my clinically diagnosed amnesia. I honestly don't have answers most of the time. Brain is healing... I think? Just slowly, glacially slowly. Physical pain still exist, no surprise. It gets even worse when I have to tackle stairs or slopes (inclines/declines). Reteaching myself how to walk is a major bummer, I could do without my moms bitchin' ""walk straight!"". I don't need her two cents, it worsens so many aspects of my mental state. I mean come on I was in a coma and atrophy set in, are serious?! cut me some slack.  "
24orhq,TBI,"One of the things I was warned about after my TBI was an increased risk of seizures. I can only assume that other TBI sufferers were told similarly. Has anyone who suffered TBI had seizures since their injury, and if so, what are the circumstances surrounding your seizures?

I have had one seizure since my injury. I was taken to a psychiatrist, and after some evaluation, he prescribed me a medication to help with some behavioral issues I was exhibiting. I only took the medication one time. After I took it, I seized up on the couch while talking to my roommate and neighbor. 

Obviously, I stopped taking that medication, and I refused any other medications from my psychiatrist."

238kdh,TBI,"I have a relative suffering from a TBI, after his initial coma and craniotomy, he is slowly returning to function, with very limited communication, and several other complications. 

My questions is, what are some easy ways to help him communicate, since he can't speak and has limited use of limbs. He can pick up a pen but can't quite get the words written, and he can raise his arms and legs on command. (We're really, really happy)

Are there any iPad apps, or other techniques or resources recommended for people with handicaps that may make communication easier? Thanks!"
41nw8d,TBI,"A friend of mine recommended I watch this a while ago and I just finished it and thought it was a fantastic movie. It should really hit right at home with all of us. It's The Crash Reel, a movie about the snowboard rider Kevin Pearce who suffers from a TBI caused by an accident. 

I searched the TBI subreddit and found it's already been linked here (https://www.reddit.com/r/TBI/comments/2tspab/the_crash_reel/) but since that was a while ago I thought it needed another mention if anyone didn't see that post. 

He really goes through symptoms that I imagine are just about identical to what we're going through, yet he handles things in an interesting and helpful way.

I also loved this part. I shared it with all my friends and I'm pretty sure every single one will think ""YEP, THAT HAPPENS."":

""It's definitely embarrassing sometimes for us to be out in public with Kevin. No offense Kevin. But sometimes he'll just say something inappropriate, coming off as me like too upfront and blunt about things.""

3vqhbj,TBI,"Hi.  I suffered a severe diffuse axonal injury TBI last July, and I'm back at college now and am going to graduate in 2 weeks at the end of this semester.  Double major in Business and international studies, somewhat mediocre but not awful GPA.  I'll admit I made a miraculous recovery, but the past 2 months I've been battling really severe depression and anxiety.  I think it has to do with being back at school (Fall semester is quite short) and having tons of ""I could have"" moments.  Time just seems to fly way too quickly lol.  I'm asking for your honest opinion, what are the chances of me finding and keeping a job that's white collar, hopefully at a large company?  My memory is sometimes abysmal.  I'm not going to name my school but I can assure you that it ranks in the top 30 every year and has well known in the northeast, particularly in NYC and Boston.  Throughout my recovery so far I have dreamed of having a job and living in nyc like my friends but now I'm realizing that was a bloody pipe dream.  I'm definitely not the same person that I was before my injury, oh well. Thanks!"
3pwuo3,TBI,"Here's my problem, I got in a car wreck in July, got a 3 on the Glasgow Coma Scale which is the worst you can get. I was in a coma for about a month, was in the hospital for 3 months.  I broke my C2 and C3 in my neck, my collarbone and my hip. I clearly had a TBI because I went to inpatient rehab to relearn how to walk and I'm currently in outpatient rehab. I still use a walker to walk.  

Here's the thing. I feel like the classes at outpatient therapy teach common sense. I don't want to be rude and say this is all just common sense, because I know it might be helpful for the other 4 people in there. 

I'm only 28 and I'm college educated so I know it can be harder to understand where I'm at for the cognitive tasks given by the therapists. I sort of just feel like it's a waste of time/too easy because I go every week day for 6 hours a day.  Like I understand I probably need it just with harder stuff. Has anyone else felt this way?"
3impu7,TBI,"My bosses at work have been suspecting for a long time something is wrong about me when I can't remember off the top of my head what shifts I have for work, even if it's literally tomorrow, or how many chicken I just dropped in the frier. 

The heat is on and I'm debating telling them. And over in medical land, I am struggling to get a neuropsychological evaluation because nobody wants to pay for it. I can't, medicaid won't, and auto doesn't exist. (The car accident that probably caused this--there were a few other incidents that could have caused the TBI, but I point to auto because it has MRIs after it and it won't lead to criminal charges against people I still somewhat care about (abuse is complicated)--was over a decade ago, and the information about it simply doesn't exist in insurance records anymore. But everyone is behaving like it's acting yesterday.

So let's laugh at the quirks.

How productive it is when my brain decides five minutes is five hours. I get a shitton of homework done when I slip into a brain-time-vortex! (then I get really really bored.) 

How, when the guy next to me on drive thru asked every person ""do you want to donate to 'no child left hungry?' My brain interpreted it throughout the day as:

1. no child gets dessert
2. no child is hungry
3. no child gets to be hungry

Those were the major variations. (Dessert is my favorite. ""No dessert for children, anywhere!"")

Or how I swear I heard my manager ask me to drop 600 mozzarella sticks into the frier, and I was almost going to do it (while puzzling if we even had that many in the fry freezer) before I said ""hang on a second, can you repeat yourself?"" (she said six.)

Or how, in another fast food place, I was trying to puzzle out why the hell a guy was wearing a polka-dotted hat when I realized no, my brain had just decided to merge his hair with a woman's shirt. (The woman was in front of him.) 

Most of this is fucking awful and depressing and frustrating. I hate it. I hate feeling like my brain has turned against me. But I have to laugh when I can. Or I'll just get nuttier. "
3gm1ni,TBI,"Alright, ( I have started typing this 3 times now?) May as well stop with the backspace.

I had a pretty bad jolt to the head 4 years ago in September. I was attacked, choked and my head bashed repeatedly into a hardwood floor, I don't know how many times.  I was very lucky to come out of the situation with my life.

A long night in the emergency room, 3 staples later the next month was a very quiet one. My roommate at the time informed me much later that I had been silent for days on end, robotic in my day to day motions. Lacking in personality or social input. 

It has been 4 years since the incident. I did very little follow up with the concussion (it wasn't my first) and I actually managed to crack my head one good time on my own and get another concussion. (came up and smacked into an open medicine cabinet, blood everywhere, headaches for days)

Now, I recognize that in the area of long term effects I AM VERY FORTUNATE. I space out a bit at times,...I am not as...sharp; as I was once. I have some headaches, an occasional bit of confusion with how I should react to emotional situations. 

The big one..my short term memory...it is a problem.
Most of the time in my daily life, I allow it to be joked about, passed over as being a little ditsy or just plain forgetful.
It is maddening though, I am goddamn smart *shrug/sigh* but I just...I don't retain certain things as well as I wish I did.  

I am going to a brain/spine center to see a specialist this month and start to be proactive about this stuff. It has taken me 4 years in September to get myself to the point of actually dealing with it all. 

There is a lot I want to do, I need degrees to do these things.
I am so scared of math in school...I haven't been in college since the incident and when I took the math portion of testing to start my new college where I live now...I cried when I got to the car later. 

Anyone else dealt with ""back to school"" aspect? Or the daily shit of just...not having the sharpness you had once? any thoughts? Maybe I just needed to rant where I had a hope of being understood. "
3ebkzk,TBI,"I feel like NOBODY understands what I am going through but I know truthfully somebody here will which is why I need to vent/share. Sorry this is so long.

15 years ago when my now husband then high school boyfriend was 15 he was in a catastrophic go kart accident. He went head first into a tree no helmet. He ended up with 17 skull fractures was in shock and it was such a rural area he was basically hanging on by a thread once he got to the hospital.


He was rushed into emergency surgery as the entire back of his skull was exposed. We were told he would not survive and if he did survive he wouldn't be who he was before. The topic of organ donation came up it was all surreal. His head was so messed up they couldn't even focus on his other injured body parts at that time but at last he made it through surgery.

He did remarkably well nurses and doctors in intensive care were shocked. They put a lot of stock that his open skull fractures actually helped him with pressure etc. He only spent one week in intensive care and then he went home which seemed so fast after such terrible injuries but not unheard of.

He went back to school a few weeks after going home and back to his normal high school life. Everything was great for years and years. We graduated we got married in our early twenties. And for a while everything was perfect he had a head ache here or there sometimes migraines. He also would struggle with his long term memory and sometimes short term but he just dealt with it in his own way.

Lately my husband has been complaining of terrible pain around the scars on the back of his head. He takes whatever otc pain reliever we have in the house and it seems to go away. I am here because with the pain comes marked mood changes and behavioral issues I have never seen in him have and it's scary. The problem is he doesn't seem to think he is having rapid mood changes. I don't think he remembers them. 

He gets frustrated with simple task that he never had a problem with before and the smallest sounds have started driving him crazy. He has also become extremely impulsive in regards to spending money. All of these issues seem to begin and end with the pain/headaches around the scars. 

When he has no pain and feels good he is back to his old self but once he gets a tinge of pain it's on. I just stay out of his way because he will look for something to essentially be mad about.

I have talked to him about going to the doctor but he refuses. I am concerned because after his accident once released from the hospital he never really had any after care except one or two visits to the family doctor. 

How do I convince him to see a doctor should I just go ahead and make an appointment with a neurologist for him??? I just don't want to go about this the wrong way.

3c5aoz,TBI,"My TBI was 5 months ago. I didn't sustain any cognitive or memory deficits but I'm paralyzed on my left side. My leg has improved a lot. I'm walking with a cane and I have a small amount of movement in my arm but nothing useful. I can't do any of the things I used to enjoy, I've lost all of my friends and I spend every day laying in bed alone wishing I was just dead. I think I'll kill myself this weekend I just haven't decided how. I'm not willing to live if I have to live the rest of my life like this. I want to swim again. I want to run and hike and have my fully functional body back. And if I can't get that I refuse to continue. I hate my life and everything about it. "

2qnljl,TBI,"For everyone who suffers or has suffered post-traumatic brain injury (PTBI) headaches, I have several questions:

1. Did you have headaches before your TBI?
2. Is the headache on one side or both?
3. Does the headache affect your vision or hearing?
4. How long does the headache usually last?
5. How would you describe the type of pain?
6. How many weeks/months has it been since your injury?
7. What relief (if any) have you found?
8. Has anything been found on MRI re: your headaches? 
9. Do you normally wake up with a headache?
10. Anything you would like people in general to know about these headaches?

I have no particular purpose in asking. I'm affected by headaches and they're debilitating sometimes so I just want to throw these questions out there and see what other people are dealing with."
2mmwii,TBI,"I work at a pretty big company, before my accident, I was well liked and very social, I was a popular low level supervisor and coordinated a constant stream of snacks, pot luck lunches, etc.

After the accident, I was a pariah, I had become short tempered and clumsy, I fall a lot, wear an eyepatch, and can't remember my coworkers. In addition, my employer has tried to isolate me as I'm ""bad for morale.""

So after half a year of this, I've adopted a new tactic.

I am a TBI ambassador. I answer every silly question, defuse the embarrassment by being very forthright.

It's hard telling people I can't remember things, or that when they show me a funny thing on their phone it is just a blur. Or explaining why I can't drive, or walk into things. I make a lot of jokes.

Does it work? IDK, maybe. At least nobody avoids me anymore, people always visit my isolated work area and now that the hard questions are in the open, they often come by just to chit chat.

Best of all, my employer's attempts to shut me away have failed, rather than me being isolated, my workspace is the new favorite lunch spot.

Maybe this isn't for everyone, but Im going to keep trying it and see if it works for me."
2lx1af,TBI,"My SO suffered a serious head injury a few months ago.  He has a severe TBI (traumatic brain injury).  He was in a coma for about a week, and since coming out of it he has steadily improved.  After 5 weeks he was able to be transferred to an inpatient rehab center, where he worked really hard.  Two months after his injury, he was released and continues to go to outpatient rehab appointments weekly.

In general, he is doing much better.  His doctors and nurses are surprised at the speed in which he has improved.  His memory seems fine, his personality seems to be intact, and his motor control has improved vastly.

But there are changes.  Granted, for a TBI he is still early in the recovery phase so there is hope that these things will continue to get better.  His cognition is slower (though not very bad honestly- it is hardly noticeable.  I notice because I knew him before the accident).  His vision was affected (partial blindness).  His speech is a bit slurry (but improving).  In the beginning it was possible he could die, then not wake up, then be wheelchair bound.  He has overcome so much in such a short time that the deficits he has now seem more and more insignificant.

I love him so much.  Before the accident we were discussing long term plans together- including getting married.  I was certain this was the man I was going to marry.  And you know what?  I still am.  I’ve been by his side throughout his painful hospital experiences, comforting him and keeping him motivated- and that has made our bond even stronger.  He has a long way to go in his recovery and in his healing, and there is still so much that is possible to get better.  And his positive attitude through the whole thing is so inspiring.  Yes it is hard.  Yes we have a long way to go in the recovery process.  Yes it is scary not knowing how much he will recover of his previous self.  But I have taken the time to become well informed of TBI recovery- I am aware of the coming challenges.  I love him more than ever, and I want to be there to help him.  

So- the problem is that everyone under the sun has their damn unsolicited opinions about what I should do.  Such as: that the chances of us being in a happy successful relationship are lower (actual words a friend said to me).  That it would be less painful for me to break off being his girlfriend.  That I am in danger of investing too much time in someone who may not fully recover (I am nearing the end of my child-bearing years).

I am trying to block what these people say, and trust my own intuition and judgment.  But it is hard and wears me down, especially when the comments come from family and close friends.  Most of the comments come from people who haven’t witnessed his recovery progression and don’t know very much about TBI.  The people most supportive of me are my SO’s family.  

The comments people make don’t change how I feel about my decision to stay and be there for my SO, but it does make me sad and discouraged at times.  I know it comes from a place of concern that people have for me, but it just feels unsupportive.

TL;DR: Committed to my SO in his recovery from a severe TBI, family and friends don’t understand and make unsupportive comments that make me feel discouraged.

2lt6yu,TBI,"Hello all. I am a TBI survivor. My accident was 4.5 years ago. I crashed a powered parachute (it wasn't flying) into a metal gate and broke my femur, a vertebrae, my sternum, and had 14 facial bone and skull fractures along with subarachnoid hemorrhage. It was a long road to recovery; although it felt like forever at the time it seems like a long way to come in a pretty short amount of time. I am a registered nurse. I worked trauma/ER before the crash and I work in Gastroenterology now. I was out of work for about 18 months and started back (and still am) part time. My physical injuries have all healed. I was left without a sense of smell from a basilar skull fracture. I still have some issues with TBI related problems. I am here to see what others have to discuss about TBI and offer any advise I can. Please feel free to inbox me any questions!! Nice to 'meet' you all :)

28hcqe,TBI,"I don't know if I can give any specific advice to anybody. All I can say is, persevere. Stay strong. Stick through it. Life can be so fucking hard. It can feel so unfair. It's got a lot of potential to be a really beautiful experience though. There were points in my recovery when I would really rather have been dead than alive. I didn't quite get to the point of being suicidal, I think that had more to do with me simply being too scared. I just didn't want to be alive anymore. Amazingly, I'm past that stage. I've gotten to where I can love life. I see all the beautiful things life has to provide, and I know how worth it life can be. A big part of that has been coming to acceptance. Accepting the things in life for the way they are. Life is unpredictable. There are so many things that we have no control over. Try not to get so caught up in those things, worry about the things you have actual control over. Set realistic goals. Accomplish those goals. Have love for people. At the end of the day, everybody's human. Shitty people are shitty because of their own insecurities. I'll let ya know though, it's pretty hard being a shitty person to a genuinely kind and empathetic human being."

43ms4x,TBI,"I sustained a DAI TBI in '05... I am trying to get this tbi waiver that will allow me to receive treatment from several specialist. However, right now, I am in limbo, but when I have been able to be awake and such, I have looked into various things that I have been experiencing so then I am able to at least keep them in mind.. but again, until then, I have zero neuro doctors. I've figured out a lot, but I am concerned about the concept of me burning glucose so rapidly cause constant hunger and thirst (yes, I understand that I need to eat REAL food/am mainly vegan.. i've been living off of $70/week) 

The other day, I just started typing in all of these symptoms that I was experiencing into Google and all of the top results (that were accurate with my symptoms) were about starvation. 

This made me (reasonably) concerned. I don't really know what's going on.. I mean, starvation is a fairly big deal, ha. I mean, when I am hungry, I can't function, I think it's fairly accurate to say that my body begins to shut down.. 
I've been so broke (my dog eats better than I do and life) that I have had very minimal food (yes, I am going to try to go to a food pantry) but for the time being, I have really just been sleeping, and having less food... I don't know if I should like watch out for certain symptoms or etc. that could be serious...

404kn4,TBI,"I suffered a traumatic brain injury when I was 13 as the result of an accident with my horse. I was in a coma for a week and went through a month of rehabilitation to regain all muscle and motor use. Coming out of the coma was a slow process; I could not talk, hold my own head up, walk, or anything even close to that. My grandmother told me post accident that drinking would always be 10x worse for me but I just sort of assumed she made it up but then just today my mom told me that one of my doctors had told me that I should probably never drink. However, another doctor said after two years I would be just like anybody else. As far as they could tell there was no permanent damage (no bleeding of the brain or anything). 
Update..I am 25 years old and graduated with a Master's degree in August. The first time I ever drank alcohol was when I was 16 years old and I was sick for a week. Following that I drank a couple more times in high school and then quite a bit for about 3 months when I turned 18. For the next few years I drank here and there; sometimes just a couple glasses of wine but other times a long night out type of scenario. I don't drink too much now but I do enjoy a few glasses of wine with boyfriend on the weekend. There has been a handful of times where we drank enough to classify it as ""binge"" drinking. Overall I am healthy; I teach group exercise classes, run half marathons, and have a healthy diet. My anxiety gets the best of me at times and right now I am hoping to get some answers. Do you think I caused any permanent damage by drinking in the years since the accident? Will drinking on occasion, say, hinder my mental capacity (both short term and long term) above that of somebody who never suffered a TBI? Factual, scientifically proven information (if it's out there) would be much appreciated. Personal experiences may provide some consolation or harsh truths as well. "

3snwvq,TBI,"My boyfriend and I are both in college (juniors).  We are both studying physics and have great job opportunities in our field after we graduate.  I was a B+ average student before the accident.  

Problem is that we got into a car accident.  The car rolled and we were thrown off the highway due to ice.  **He was driving.**  He came out unscathed, but I hit my head really hard on the side window.  I was only out for a minute, but when I came to was just in shock.  My boyfriend was incredibly frustrated at himself for the accident so most of my attention was on him.

I never went to the ER because I felt okay for the most part (shock) and didn't want my family upset with my boyfriend for the accident.    

The following day however, I knew my injury was not something small.  Couldn't sleep, bad headaches, sensitivity to light all were there. I got a CT and then went through the long process of tests, dropping classes due to the TBI, and stressing about my life.

Months following the concussion I got dramatically better, but only in some aspects.  I currently just don't feel 'the same' as before.  

**It has been almost a year since my concussion.**

Memory, anxiety, depression, and ADHD have all gotten worse after the accident and its starting to take a toll on my academic career.  I can't learn like I used to, preform like I used to, and struggle with the stress of knowing it's not my best!

Needless to say my parents are upset.  I was supposed to start a 5th year after taking last semester off, but I may need to go longer considering I still have issues when pushed hard academically.  

My parents think I'm back 100%, but the truth is things still aren't the way they should be.  However, my boyfriend's family is not well off financially and I'm afraid my parents may sue/push for more compensation from the accident settlement due to needing more school/pushing graduation/job offer.

Speaking of job offers, I had signed a job offer with the mindset that I would be back 100% by now, but I have not healed completely and I am worried the change in start date will lose my offer.  Or they won't want to honor an offer to a TBI patient.

I'm lost as to what I can do now.  I don't want to take 6 years for college as I just feel ashamed of it.  But I'm so close to finishing, I can't stop.  My family just expects me to be better and I worry about my boyfriend and our future with finances piling up.

My boyfriend was so supportive at first (and still is!) but I can feel his frustration when he hears me say I have to drop a class, or I may need another year.  My psychiatrist has been helpful here, as I vent to him not my boyfriend, but I'm afraid my bf will grow tired of 'excuse after excuse' especially when the TBI effects are not physical at this point.

Lost and frustrated.  It felt good to vent and get it all out there though."
3jjnqw,TBI,"It's been 2 years since my TBI and ABI. I've been in rehab since, but I'm starting to feel ready. My rehab doctor says that it's just a ""thinking"" problem I have that makes me think I'm ready... but I really am. 

I'm hoping to be back on campus next fall. I am planning on dorming again, but closer to home. I need to get my independence back and figure out my own problems again. 

I still have a bit to figure out what I want to do again, I've been thinking about it for a year now, but I still haven't figured it out. I was in nursing school before my injury, but I know I won't be able to work in that field anymore. Maybe it's just that I just don't want to be a nurse anymore? I do, but I don't. That is the #1 reason why someone shouldn't go into that field. So I'm not anymore.

I know I'm not the same person who I was before. I'm fucking brain damaged, who wouldn't be? I may not make friends that easily, but I'll try. I'm not going to be one of those people that make their peers feel bad by bringing up my injury. If they notice scars on my head then I'll have to, but otherwise not right away.  

It'll be weird going back to school. I mean, my injury happened right when I turned 21 and I'm almost 23... I hope it won't be weird. 

Sorry, this is going into more of a rant than anything. 

But I just want to hear what other TBI survivors have to say about their experience returning to school. How far in advance were you getting ready? Dorm or commute? Just any sort of advice or anything I should be prepared for."

3cfmpc,TBI,"I'm not sure if a speech lag is exactly what I mean, so let me explain. Essentially I was in a car accident (drunk driver totaled my car) that resulted in me taking a bad blow to the head. A month or so after the accident, myself and those around me began to notice that my memory was going, and that I would often forget I was speaking whilst mid-sentence and then be confused by why everyone was staring at me. They eventually found a piece of glass from the car accident was lodged in the back of my head, pressing on my brain (which explained the huge amount of blood all over the car). They removed it, and things got a lot better, and gradually I went pretty much back to normal. I've lost some of the time around the accident, but they think that may come back in time. However, I was unfortunately in another car accident (lorry driver didn't see me, reversed into me whilst I was stationary) last week. Today I have noticed that it is happening again, where essentially I am talking and then it is like all the words are gone, and I can't remember what I was saying. The only way I can really explain is that it feels like my brain reboots itself and it takes a while to reload what I was saying before it shut down? They gave me brain training exercises and all that, but its honestly unbelievably annoying. I am someone who talks very fast, so to be mid flow and then suddenly stop is very annoying, and it's making me look stupid at work. I'm hoping that this is a stress response to having hit my head/whiplash during the most recent accident, and that my brain will go back to how it was post-surgery, but if anyone has any tips on how to handle it then that would be great. Thank you."
3a7lbm,TBI,"Several months ago my SO was injured in an accident at work.  As a result he has a mild/moderate TBI.  He has recently returned to work on light duty and is doing well.  He is still improving, but from what I understand, at some point will ""hit a wall"" and improvement will slow or stop.

The differences are subtle to others, but for him, they are huge.  He talks to me about feeling like he doesn't know himself, can't trust himself.  He confides that he isn't who he used to be and just wants to feel like himself again.  I know this may be the new him.  I tell him his soul is the same.  He still wants to do the same kind of activities, camping, fishing. He still loves the same music, tv shows, movies, finds the same jokes funny and has the same values.  

He still loves good food and has just this week began doing some light cooking again.  He loved to cook before, but for a long time the process confused him.  He couldn't figure out what needed to be done first, etc.  Sometimes even making a sandwich is overwhelming for him.  He said he can't always figure out what to do first.  He knows what is needed.  Bread, meat, cheese, mayo...but how to get those things together, where to start- just escaped him.  

He has issues with remembering things and recalling information.  He gets tired easily and confused, has problems reading (which he used to love to do), is slow to comprehend things he reads or hears, has issues with loud noises, gets overwhelmed with crowds (he used to be a very social person).  He stumbles over words and sometimes just straight-up stutters. He gets severe headaches which on occasion are completely incapacitating.  He is much more easily stressed and agitated than he used to be.

He has trouble paying bills and with general household management. Remembering to pay them or paying them twice.  (I have now moved in and we take care of these together.)

He is sometimes very embarrassed, even with me.  For instance just last night he had to ask me what state New Orleans is in.  He tells me that very often, the word is right there, but he can't make it come out of his mouth.  I told him, then he got down on himself because he couldn't recall.  

I do my best not to let him wallow.  I make him get out, do things, even if it's just light yard work.  I don't know how hard to push him.  Are there things we can do (like board games maybe?) that will help with memory?  We stick to a fairly strict schedule which seems to help.  We have a white board where we map out our week so he knows what's upcoming, what we are having for dinner, etc.  

We've developed a bit of a system for when we are with others.  I watch him to make sure he is doing ok, and he has a certain look he will give me if he needs help understanding something that has been said.  I can then say it a different way or we can step aside and talk it though.  He puts his hand on my shoulder if he is getting overwhelmed and needs to go or on my waist if he just needs a little balance assistance.  

I love this man.  What can I do to better help him?

37j8oj,TBI,"So I was a roller derby player for a number of years, and a hockey player for many years prior to that, and managed to not have really serious injuries until October. Then there was an accident where someone jumped a whistle and body-checked unsuspecting me in the face, and I bounced my head off the floor on the way down.

I was diagnosed with a concussion, and settled in for recovery. Except it never happened, not really.

Six months later, I'm still really messed up. I sleep ten to twelve hours every night minimum, and still need naps in the afternoon. I can't seem to plan out tasks very well anymore. My thinking is still super slow, I forget stuff constantly, my fingers are clumsy, my temper is weirdly short for no apparent reason. It's all I can do to edit enough stuff online to make basic rent and grocery money. (I am an editor/writer by trade. That has obviously been pretty fucked up as well.)

My doctor estimated another six months to a year of rest before I can start light exercise again. My question is, is there a difference between post-concussion syndrome and a TBI? Is there anything that can help me in any way? Whenever I've been to the doctor, she's just told me to keep resting.

I can't even go to the store to buy groceries without basically having to sleep all day the next day."
338jzp,TBI,"I posted this to a veteran's disability forum off this site, but I would appreciate the help of non-veterans as well.  I tried searching for my title on Reddit and got no hits.  This is my first Reddit post, please let me know if I did it wrong.

I have been discharged since 2009, and never received any type of help from the VA despite begin rated for TBI and Migraines, except for a couple of migraine drugs.  When I started college I went to the disability office to inquire about parking in handicap spots on campus.  The lady reviewed my VA rating letter and said she could help with everything a doctor had seen me for, but said I should really look into getting cognitive testing for the TBI issue since I was having trouble in my classes.  I said the VA was not very receptive to helping me with that, my VA always think Vets are just looking for money, and I left it there.  

Fast forward to today, my wife and I would like to start a family but I have noticed a lot of memory related problems.  Getting out of the car and leaving it running, forgetting what cupboard the glasses are in, can't remember medications.  When I was a substitute teacher I would forget the kids were at lunch or another classroom, I couldn't remember lesson plans for more than a minute, and going to the wrong school for work.  And there have been a few times when I have been driving and I have completely forgot where I was, who I was, and so on; that has been very freighting while it was happening.  After a couple of those last episodes my VA primary care doctor referred me to the TBI clinic.  But they say there is no reason for me to be there, they are trying to make me out to be a scammer, and it is really just a depressing situation to be in.  One doctor at the VA says I need help, when I go for that help, they make me out to be a crook.

I was hoping someone out there would know if there is some kind of service in the metro Detroit area that is kind of like physical therapy, but for TBI.  Someone we could sit down with and explain that I am afraid I would forget the kids in the car, or forget to change the diaper regularly, and whatever you have to do with a baby.  And maybe there is some stuff we can buy or do that would help.  I can't use anything I have to remember to use (like a stuffed animal that I move around in the car, starting an app, or using a check list).  I need to use things that don't require me to remember to use them in the first place.  I have seen car seats that car be hardwired into the car's ignition, and beep until weight is removed from the car seat when the car is shut off.  I think that is a solid way to go for the car rides.  But then there is the shopping cart, or leaving the kid at home on accident, remembering to change diapers, and everything else.  Maybe even a professional opinion if I should even watch the kid on my own.  So that is why I think there must be someone or a specialty out there that we could pay for out of pocket (out of the VA healthcare system) to help me.  I don't think I could live with myself if I accidentally killed my kid because I forgot them.  Any suggestions are welcome, thank in advance for your input.

2xw8j1,TBI,"Hi,

Before I get started, I'd like to thank this community for providing a proxy-inspiration for me. I don't have a TBI, but my Dad does (60 years old), and seeing individuals who have suffered a TBI interact in this forum gives me hope for not only myself, but for my father as well. I have tried, during the past 11 months of being the sole caretaker of my father, to understand his point of view; but even with all of my experience with him pre- and post-TBI, I feel that our relationship to eachother has changed. He has changed during his recovery, and I have certainly changed in the time since his accident. I know that TBIs are incredibly varied between individuals, but reading about so many of your struggles and triumphs against a criminally-neglected condition inspires in me a sense of hope I haven't felt in a long, long time. Thank you.

Now, to my story: On April 6th, 2014, my father suffered a TBI as a result of a motorcycle wreck. He was ""unconscious"" (as the doctors carefully termed it) for about a week. After, he ""woke up"" and tried to communicate to myself and his girlfriend. BTW, I'm 27 years old (26 at the time); I have no siblings or spouse and neither does he. His parents are deceased. His inpatient recovery took approximately 1 month. He was in outpatient therapy for 2 months. His progress since his accident have been amazing, and disappointing, at the same time. He went from not being able to walk, talk, feed himself, remember my name, remember his girlfriends name, recall brief periods of time before prompting, to being able to do all of those things without confabulating or losing temper. He still cannot drive (due to displopia), remember trivial memories (such as what he had for breakfast, or what he wants from the grocery store, or who called him 30 minutes ago), use the right side of his body proficiently (due to the accident impairing his use of his ride side, from sight and speech to motor function), or incorporate empathy into his interactions with others.

I dropped out of graduate school to take care of him. There's nobody else here with me, except for his girlfriend, who he stays with occasionally. There's nobody else. I hate to come here, which seems to be a forum of survivors and talk about how hard it is to be with my dad, but I'm desperate for help. I live in Alabama; the resources for TBI survivors and family members in this state are woefully inadequate. I'm honestly just looking for someone to talk to, to share experiences with, to share hope with. Because I'm terrified...I'm terrified that neither myself nor my Dad will be able to live a satisfying life, and that I will grow to resent him for being so foolish and negatively impacting not only himself but the lives of those around him.

If there is someone or something (forums, meetings, whatever) who is able to listen and share with me, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you."
2xg0hk,TBI,"Hi everyone.  I'm hoping anyone who reads this can let me know if anything I'm describing sounds familiar in the context of TBI.

A little over a year ago, my 70 year old father sustained a head injury.  He hit his head very hard and opened a gash in his scalp that bled a fair amount but did not require stitches.  He was diagnosed with a mild concussion.  A CT scan was done which led to an MRI, but the MRI showed nothing of concern.  Just ""normal aging"", they said.  

My father experienced a lot of emotional lability in the weeks following the incident, as reported by both himself and my mother.  He had a couple of aggressive outbursts which were uncharacteristic in their ferocity.  He went to see a therapist during this time.

My father is a complicated guy - he has a lot of good qualities and talents, but he has also always been very narcissistic, often very negative and critical and as his family, we have always lived with a sort of controlled explosiveness, not abusive, but a sense that he is always getting set off and frustrated by things.  All that stuff has been pretty constant in his life.  He also, for the last 20 years or so, has brought up the topic of divorce with my mother about every five years, but has always realized that it wasn't what he wanted to do, and recommitted.  

This year, around eight or nine months after his injury, he announced that he was leaving the marriage, and moving out.  He moved quickly into a new place.  He said his intention was to still be in the area to maintain family connections - grandkids, etc.  One month ago, he announced that he'd met someone 3 months earlier, and that they were going to move across the country and buy a home together.  

All of this could just be normal human folly, but there are a few things that make me wonder if some of this is a result of a TBI.  

Since the incident, he has displayed a great degree of irritation in regards to noise.  He's always been irritated by things, but this particular problem seems to be a preoccupying feature of his life now.  The sound of cars especially seems to get him very worked up.  

He seems to swing a bit wildly, cognitively... He will send an email one day proclaiming his deep sentimental attachment to something in the household (we're working on dividing up all the ""stuff""), and the next day he will reverse his position and say he's not actually interested after all.

These are kind of the major ones:  indifference, inability to see the impact of his actions on others, risk-taking, disregard for the future.  He seems mostly rational when you talk to him, but he also seems somehow not to recognize or care about the pain he's causing.  There's just a strange quality, it's hard to put a finger on it.  There's some kind of unreachable quality to him.  We (his family and many friends) feel like we don't really know him anymore.  I don't really know how to explain it.  It isn't just the actions, it's a quality that pervades them that just seems off.  Like a reflective element that used to be there is missing?  As if there was a wiser part of him that despite all of his more immature(?) inclinations, kept him on a better road - and that light seems to have just gone out.  And I don't know what kind of decision-making it is to leave all of your family, friends, and community, and move across the country to buy a house with someone you met three months ago.... but it seems at least mildly suspect.

I realize this is so long - thank you so much to anyone who reads it.  All this stuff could just be his true heart's desire.  There could be normal ageing issues involved, and part of that could just be a late-life crisis.  Some of it could just be the fruition of narcissistic, unpredictable, escapist and grandiose qualities that have always been there. IDK.  Just thought I'd check in and see if anyone can relate to seeing any of this stuff manifest in TBI symptomology in your lives.  Thanks again for reading.  (I'm not sure what could be done if it is TBI, when he thinks he's fine, but I'm just wanting to explore the possibility.)

TL;DR:  My dad hit his head and went nuttier than usual.  Do indifference to others, hyper reactivity to sound, impulsivity, poor planning, inability to see impact of ones behaviors on others sound familiar as TBI symptoms?

I want to add - I hope my flippancy in my tl;dr description isn't offensive... I sustained a skull fracture and concussion at a very young age, which I feel has had profound implications and repercussions in my life.  I was just trying to lighten the (my) mood.  "
2t5uup,TBI,"It's only been a month since I've been back to this sub but felt like forever (I had to check with my 'history' more than once). I know.. er... am pretty sure it's been longer than that since I've submitted anything though. Would love to say ""I've been busy with 'life'"" but honestly, the depression worsened. It's been over a year since my coma and not much has changed. I know nothing's ""night and day"" but it has been a rough year and I still don't see a light, just a really long dark tunnel. The PTSD is no help. Medication is the only way I've been coping. A year of this b/s is more than enough... Waiting for things to ""look up"", change."

Sorry I haven't posted here before. It sounds stereotypical but I literally was about to create a sub for post concussion syndrome, then I checked and found not only does this sub exist, I was already subscribed to it...and I don't remember subscribing... heh... the way she goes, boys, the way she goes. 

I've also dealt with drug addiction, so it's a smorgasbord of problems...but that's kinda par for the course with TBIs, isn't it? I had 3 diagnoses (major depression, general anxiety, ADHD) before my doctor and I reached the conclusion that these symptoms stem from my injury.

I would love to hear your feedback about this...this condition can be a bewildering and frightening experience, and everyone has a different take on it. I hope to do an AMA tomorrow; as the sidebar says, these things are not fully understood. Comments and constructive criticism are welcome, please! As you might understand, I don't really know if I'm beating a dead horse, or if this is a good thing for those of us with a TBI (the AMA and the podcast, that is)...thanks in advance :)"

2nsvj4,TBI,I've always has bad deja vu but it's gotten considerably worse since my head injury
2n409j,TBI,"My brother fell over an indoor stairwell balcony, four stories, with no sort of head protection, on Halloween (about 3 weeks ago). He was immediately rushed to the hospital and had a Glasgow Coma Score of 7 or 8 upon arrival. He had to big breaks in his right arm (upper arm and wrist, which was sticking out), 7 broken ribs on one side and 3 on the other and then 3 skulls fractures. Miraculously, no spinal injuries and somehow he doesn't seem to have a single bruise on him.


He has ""severe contusions"" on his frontal lobe (more on the left than the right) as well as some bruising on the parietal lobe. About five days after his injury, they had to do a bi-frontal craniotomy because his intracranial pressure kept spiking and they had used up all other intervention methods.

After about 12-14 days in a medically induced coma, he's slowly started waking up. Eyes are quite alert now and he's tracking us around the room. He moves his good arm and has reached for his feeding tube and trach many times but seems to lack dexterity in his fingers. He's also breathing on his own with only a trach cradle now to moisturize the air.
In the past two days he's been moving his legs more and bending his toes, but it is all seeming to be sporadic movement.

He responds to pain in neuro tests but still doesn't seem to respond to us or doctors actually asking him to do things (i.e.: ""Squeeze my hand… Wiggle your toes…""). We talk to him and keep ""practicing"" the things the doctors or asking but they seem to be more and more negative each time he doesn't react the way they want.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what more we can do to help him? Whether it's exercises or just what he could be experiencing or anything at all to help him? We are pretty desperate for anything that provides a bit of hope at this point.

TL:DR; brother has severe TBI. not responding to neuro tests but moving limbs sporadically. suggestions for things we could do to help him?"

2ha6qc,TBI,"I suffered my TBI a little over 2 years ago on 5/17/2012. I was in a car wreck on the interstate where I was ejected from the vehicle and was in a coma for about a month. My recovery from this has been incredible. It's been unreal. Life is surreal to me. Life is so unfair but it is what it is. It's definitely a special experience. No matter how unfair, we each have the power to create our own happiness. Both happiness and misery exist in all spectrums of life. There is no benefit to comparing our lives with that of others. Live to be the best you.I've taken a bit of a break from reddit but coming back and looking through this sub and being reminded how serious a TBI is has been very...it's making things I've been dealing with make a lot more sense. I'm not making any excuses but in reality, reality is just simply *different* for somebody with a TBI. I don't know if I know how to describe it with words, life is just ""different"" for us.Well, to continue with the original intent of this post, I wanted to talk about how I've found it a bit difficult to find real hobbies or interests again. I used to be big into discovering new music but I simply don't have any interest in that anymore. Even with random current events, I don't have the desire to keep up with it and I'm finding it hard to be able to relate with people sometimes because I'm finding I don't have any real interests to talk about. Have you guys experienced a loss of interest in things you once had an interest for? Is it hard for you to get new interests or have any real interests anymore? Do you sort of find yourself to be less interesting as a person because of your TBI? Life is wild. It's worth it though. It's such a special experience. It's unpredictable, stay to see what can happen, it'll blow your mind sometimes."

People who I thought of as ""family"" (biological and otherwise), avoid me now as if I were a gangrenous leper. Being both physically and mentally disabled is quite the bitch. Been told I'm ""not the same guy anymore"", which I don't mind but I'm still trying to find out who I am now/going to be.

"
26uwxh,TBI,"They say the best of us can find happiness in misery, but it's hard to focus through the proverbial fog that is TBI. Not that my focus is as great as it used to be, thanks to the damage I bestowed upon myself. I am no stranger to self-inflicted pain. Past relationships, missed opportunities, choosing one over the other just to make a point. I used to tend to set myself up for failure, I suppose. People would say: ""no one can"", I'd respond by: ""watch me"". It is what it is, words that I'll forever live by. Things just happen, whether we like the outcome or not, just play the hand you're dealt or die. Strength is measured and valued in different lights by different people. I've been told: ""you are a better man than I"", ""you're stronger then me, there's no way I could compare"". And yet I've never felt so weak in my life, I've hit bottom and endurance is wearing thin.

**Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**

A traumatic brain injury is defi ned as an alteration in brain function, or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by an external force.

*Typical Causes of TBI*:

* Falls

* Assault

* Motor Vehicle-Traffic

* Struck by/Against

* Sports Injury

*****

**Acquired Brain Injury (ABI)**

An acquired brain injury is an injury to the brain, which is
not hereditary, congenital, degenerative, or induced by birth
trauma. An acquired brain injury is an injury to the brain that
has occurred after birth.

*Typical Causes of ABI*:

* Stroke

* Substance Abuse

* Near Drowning

* Infectious Disease

* Seizure Disorders

* Tumor

* Electric Shock

* Toxic Exposure

* Lightning Strike

* Oxygen Deprivation (Hypoxia/Anoxia)

*****

**Symptoms of Brain Injury:**

* **Physical Impairments** - speech, vision, hearing, headaches, motor coordination, spasticity of muscles, paresis or paralysis, seizure disorders, balance, and fatigue.

* **Cognitive Impairments** - short term memory deficits, impaired concentration, slowness of thinking, limited attention span, impairments of perception, communication skills, planning, writing, reading, and
judgment.

* **Emotional Impairments** - mood swings, self-centeredness, anxiety, depression, lowered self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, restlessness, lack of motivation, and diffi culty controlling emotions."
269ale,TBI,"A TBI is caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the normal function of the brain. Not all blows or jolts to the head result in a TBI. The severity of a TBI may range from “mild” (i.e., a brief change in mental status or consciousness) to “severe” (i.e., an extended period of unconsciousness or memory loss after the injury).  Most TBIs that occur each year are mild, commonly called concussions.

*****

**TBI Statistics:**

* Emergency Department Visits: 1,365,000 (3,740 per day)

* Hospitalizations: 275,000 (753 per day)

* Deaths: 52,000 (142 per day)

* Nearly 1/3 of all injury-related deaths in the US involve a traumatic brain injury.

* 5.3 million Americans live with a long-term disability as a result of TBI.

* Direct medical costs and indirect costs of TBI, such as lost productivity, totaled an estimated $60 billion in the United States in the year 2000. The societal costs of TBI's add up to more.

* Ages 0-4, 15-19 and 65+ are most likely to sustain a traumatic brain injury.

* Traumatic brain injury rates are higher for males than for females at any age.

* Falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury.

* Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause (38.1%) of traumatic brain injury related death.

* About 75% of TBIs that occur each year are concussions or other forms of mild traumatic brain injury.

*****

**Facts: What are the leading causes of TBI?**

* From 2006–2010, falls were the leading cause of TBI, accounting for 40% of all TBIs in the United States that resulted in an ED visit, hospitalization, or death.  Falls disproportionately affect the youngest and oldest age groups:

    * More than half (55%) of TBIs among children 0 to 14 years were caused by falls.              
 
    * More than two-thirds (81%) of TBIs in adults aged 65 and older are caused by falls.

* Unintentional blunt trauma (e.g., being hit by an object) was the second leading cause of TBI, accounting for about 15% of TBIs in the United States for 2006–2010:

    * Close to a quarter (24%) of all TBIs in children less than 15 years of age were related to blunt trauma.

* Among all age groups, motor vehicle crashes were the third overall leading cause of TBI (14%). When looking at just TBI-related deaths, motor vehicle crashes were the second leading cause of TBI-related deaths (26%) for 2006–2010.

* About 10% of all TBIs are due to assaults. They accounted for 3% of TBIs in children less than 15 years of age and 1.4% of TBIs in adults 65 years and older for 2006–2010.  About 75% of all assaults associated with TBI occur in young adults 15 to 44 years of age.

*****

**Risk factors for TBI:**

*Among TBI-related deaths in 2006–2010*:

* Men were nearly three times as likely to die as women.

* Rates were highest for persons 65 years and older.

* The leading cause of TBI-related death varied by age:

    * Falls were the leading cause of death for persons 65 years or older.

    * Motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause for children and young adults ages 5-24 years.

    * Assaults were the leading cause for children ages 0-4.

*Among non-fatal TBI-related injuries for 2006–2010*:

* Men had higher rates of TBI hospitalizations and ED visits than women.
    
* Rates of ED visits were highest for children aged 0-4 years.

* Falls were the leading cause of TBI-related ED visits for every age group:

    * Blunt trauma was the second leading cause of TBI-related ED visits among children 5-14 years.

* The leading cause of TBI-related hospitalizations varied by age:

    * Falls were the leading cause among children ages 0-14 and adults 45 years and older.

    * Motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of hospitalizations for adolescents and young adults ages 15-44 years."
25rmju,TBI,"On October 6, 2010, I was in a bad car wreck. My car hit a curb and flipped a few times, ejecting me through the back window. I was taken to the hospital where I remained for about a month. I was in a coma for one week when I first arrived.

I don’t remember anything about a week before my wreck, and the first thing I can recall after the wreck was being transported by ambulance from the hospital to the rehabilitation center. They were nearby each other, and the ride was short, but after that things go black for a period of time again.

I remember bits and pieces from the rehab center, where I was doing in-patient rehab for about 2 ½ months. What I remember is fuzzy for the most part. Those moments that I remember are separated by moments I don’t remember, and I don’t know how long I had been in the rehab center before I started to remember. All I know is that the rehab center and doctors who understood, to an extent, what was going on were a blessing.

I completed physical therapy. I could not stand or walk without falling over because my right leg had no balance. I was told that when I was in the hospital, I actually convinced a nurse to let me walk by myself to use the bathroom. I ended up falling and hitting my head pretty hard, again. Not sure what she was thinking… My legs are fully functional now, no problems.

The rehab center placed me in occupational therapy, which is a therapy that helps rehab your ability to maintain daily living and work skills. They also placed me in speech therapy, which helped me to become independent in its own way. Both of these therapies focused on rehabilitating cognitive functions. They were tedious; it was difficult to complete the tasks.

After I was discharged from the rehab center, my family decided to enroll me in out-patient rehab at Shepherd Center in Atlanta. Shepherd Center is ranked among the nation’s top 10 rehabilitation hospitals. They specialize in medical treatment, research and rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injury and brain injury.

My parents were dedicated enough to drive me to and from Atlanta every week in order to get me the best care available in my area. Shepherd Center did an amazing job, and they used techniques that I had not seen while in-patient. Anyone who needs recovery advice/help could contact them, especially if you are in the region.

After months of rehab at Shepherd, I was discharged and taken back to my home town to continue out-patient therapy at the same rehab center I stayed at for in-patient. My insurance covered a certain number of visits.

Throughout my rehab, doctors noted that stressors could cause deterioration in the healing process. There was one giant stressor in my life: I was in legal trouble. After my wreck, I was charged with felony DUI, and I faced up to 3 years in a state prison. This caused me to plummet into the darkest times of my life. I lashed out towards people I love, I became forgetful, I became paranoid, and I was not able to function as a “normal” person in society (at my job, with friends/family, at home, etc.).

I was sentenced to 2 years community control (also known as house arrest) plus 3 years probation with a bunch of other stipulations that aren’t important to Reddit, mostly because those who had control over my fate found it in their hearts to allow me to stay out of prison. It felt like a giant weight was lifted off my shoulders when I found out that I would not have to go to prison, and I feel like that is when I was able to start re-healing again -  re-re-healing.  :)

It has been just over two years since I was sentence. I got off of community control two weeks ago. In the past two years, the people who have constantly been around me have told me that they notice a difference in me from week-to-week or month-to-month. It’s the healing process. With the help of rehabilitation, and the blessing provided by a few people, I have been able to come a long ways. I have a new perspective on life.

46uxaz,TBI,"Hi there. I'm writing a character with a bullet-induced traumatic brain injury, which is why I subscribed to this subreddit. However, I have yet to find a particular answer for his mobility.

I read that people with TBI would only wear a cane early on before they can easily walk unassisted. For now the character only uses a cane when he's fatigued or is in a crowd. 

What are your experiences with TBI and mobility? Thanks."

45y25u,TBI,"Hello,,

First i'm sorry for the long story, there is a TLDR at the bottom

I don't have one specific  question but i have a lot of trouble not knowing what to expect.
I know that every person is unique and so is their healing process but i'm just wondering if other people have the same experiences.

So here is how it happend ( i don't remember anything but this is what the hospital and my friends and family told me).

I was at a party and i decided to go home early because finals were coming up. so i rode my bike (without a helmet) ate apparently quite a speed home and i bumped into a sign board and fell on my head. luckily there were witnesses who called the ambulance. when the ambulance arrived i scored only 3 points on the Glasgow coma scale. so i was intubated to help my breathing.
The doctors were expecting the worst, so my parents (who live in an other city) were picked up by the police and were driven with high speed and sirens to the hospital. also my boyfriend was called and him was told that he needed to come but he shouldn't drive alone.

When i arrived at the hospital my body temperature had dropped to 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit). when they had rised my temperature my score on the Glasgow coma sclare was 7 (which is still a coma).
I also had a CT scan and my blood was screened.

Luckily i didn't have any damage in my spine or had any broken bones. I only had a massive hole on my head.
In the evening the following night they stopped my morphine and i woke up from my coma. and because i was doing well the evening after that i was allowed to go to my parents, and i should not be alone at any time.

This all is now 5 almost 6 weeks ago. and i still have alot of  the common problems with concentrating  and mood swings and such.
But i also see cross-eyed which they want to look into further after 3 months.

So what I am looking for is someone with similar experience. because i was studying for my masters degree in chemical engineering and from the university i have to make plans on how to continue. and i'm struggling what i want and can do at all. I just want to talk to someone and share ideas such, off course do i also want to help other people with advice and such.

I really hope someone on here can help, but it also helped to write it all at al. and i'm sorry if my English is a mess, it is not my native language and a struggle with writing.

**TLDR: I had an accident after i ended up in a coma, and i'm struggling on how to continue my live and what i can expect**

45t259,TBI,"Hi there,

I fell of my motorcycle in October. I was wearing a helmet and full crash suit, but I still managed to get a concussion (including rebound injury) and I damaged my vestibular system. I couldn't read or write for a couple of days, and I trouble with a mental ""fog"" and cognitive impairment for a couple of weeks.

With the prescribed rest, I finally got my cognition and memory back to normal. But I've noticed I'm prone to panic attacks and anxiety in social situations, and outbursts or irritability with my wife and children. I've always been an easy-going, extroverted person. My patience with people is legendary among my friends.

But now, I can be set off pretty easy, and I don't like mingling like I used to. I don't like noise, especially simultaneous noises, because I often can't ""filter"" sounds like I used to.

I've been Googling, but the literature out there seems mixed. My doctor recommended anti-anxiety for these behaviors and the 24/7 headache that goes along with it, but I'm hesitant to take anything that could further alter my conscious experience.

I was wondering if any of you have been through this or how you coped. I honestly feel silly for being so effected by a bump on the head for this long."
45dg8u,TBI,"A while ago I got incredibly drunk and got into a bar fight, in which I was punched in the back of the head by a second attacker. I didn't fall down or lose consciousness after the punch, and I think I continued fighting for a little bit until security showed up. I ran from the scene and took a cab home, where I remember apologizing profusely to my friend. I went home and fell asleep and woke up the next day with a mildly painful bruise/bump on the back of my head near the area where the neck/spine connects with the head. I had no other concussion symptoms, and I remember bits and pieces of the incident, which includes some moments from the fight, running from the scene, and getting home and looking myself in the mirror and thinking to myself that I was massively drunk. I felt 100% fine the next day.

Now this was a while ago and I felt fine the next day so I never got checked. However, the location of the punch and the bump bothers me a bit as I suffered a concussion when I was about 12 years old. Could that punch have caused a mild concussion that was ""masked"" by the effects of alcohol, or does the fact that I was able to continue fighting, run away from security, and remember bits and pieces of the night suggest otherwise?

According to Dr. Ghajar of the Brain Trauma Foundation:
> 
> ... it's very rare to get a traumatic brain injury from being hit on the back of the head. The back part doesn't stretch very much because it's part of the neck. If it did, people after a concussion would complain of being blind, because that's the part of the brain that controls vision.

http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=7121271&page=1

So given the location (punched where the neck and head join) and the fact that I wasn't dazed or had suffered symptoms of a concussion the next day, would it generally be safe to assume that I had not been concussed and was simply very drunk?

Thanks guys."

44dcdp,TBI,"Hello. I have a bit of a long story, and some questions. I'll try not to go into too much extraneous detail. I'd love to answer questions if anyone has.

I'm 25 years old. When I was a child, about 6 or 7, I hit my head on a rock and blacked out. By the time my father came to find out what had happened, I had already come to. I was bleeding, and I think I was pretty disoriented but my father apparently didn't think it was serious.  He cleaned the cut and bandaged it, but they never took me to a doctor for it.

That's the last thing I remember clearly from that period of my life. After that there's a blank space in my memory, with only a few moments of clarity. I know I was scared that something was wrong with me. I know I tried to talk to my father about it at least once, but for some reason I was scared to come out and talk about it directly, I felt ashamed for some reason. I really dont know why.

I forgot about all that for a while, maybe I suppressed it. I rediscovered the memories recently. I read a list of common symptoms of mild TBI and literally every one was something I do/deal with all the time. I later showed the list to my wife and she agreed.

I went to a neurologist, she took my seriously and I've started doing tests. I've had an EEG that was clean, a sleep EEG that I'm still waiting for results from, and am waiting to do a TOVA test for my attention problems. I also had a CT scan previously for persistant tinnitus that didn't show anything as far as I know.

I resisted going to a doctor for a whilw because I felt it was pointless, but I really need to know. Even if there is nothing that can be done to help I need proof that I have damage for my emotional well-being if nothing else.

I guess my questions are:

1. Are there likely to be any results of this series of tests I'm doing? What is the chance there'll be any signs after all this time?

2. Even if they do find proof of brain damage, what can be done? Besides maybe drugs for the attention problems. I've read that recovery can continue for years, but this injury might have happened as much as 20 years ago. Is there any chance therapy could help after all that time?

Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this, and thank you for this subreddit. I've been lurking for a while getting up the courage to post, and you make me feel less alone and like there is hope. I can't say what that means to me. Thank you."
449ksa,TBI,I am a student struggling to pay attention in class after my TBI I received in April 2015. Has anyone taken adderall to help them focus and pay attention? Has anyone had any negative side effects? 
43woxg,TBI,"I had a serious subdural hematoma back in 2014 when I was taken the the hospital after being unconscious for 10 hours. Had a big midline shift and my right eye was paralyzed along with my left leg both mostly came back with mild tingling in my left foot and sluggish light reaction in my right eye. 

Second concussion about 7 months later had to be observed and couldn't be woken up a few days but recovered. (Went in for a scan which was negative)

Now I think I might have an issue again because I had a minor incident no where near as serious as my second concussion. My right pupil is slightly dilated probably %15-%20 larger than my left and I've had a mild headache for a few days, drowsy, watery eyes occasionally, hazy thinking, and I'm told I've had behavioral changes. (Similar to my second concussion)

At what point would you guys put it past another concussion and go in for a scan?"
43vdzr,TBI,My boyfriend got a TBI 10 years ago from rock climbing. He has epilepsy from the accident. He still has emotional issues from it. There is a lot of shame and embarassment he carries from it. I believe that negative energy affects other aspects of his life and it would be better to release it. Sometimes he'll get into a fit of anger or say he feels like everyone is ganging up on him. I want to help  and support him. What is the best way to go about this?
42mggj,TBI,"In May 2015, I suffered a concussion playing ice hockey. After about two months I was sent for physical therapy to be cleared to resume playing and resume exercise. I was cleared and resumed playing for about 3 months with no issues until October. Since then whenever I do physical activity (running, exercise bike, etc) I get lightheadedness (and sometimes headaches and dizziness) and anxiety for several days after. I haven't been able to do anything since October. Is this a common symptom of PCS? Since Christmas I have felt relatively fine, but I don't know when I should start physical activity again. Anyone experience this that give some insight?"

41wnwf,TBI,"Hit head 1 week ago and went to docs 4 days ago and he diagnosed as mild concussion, ever since the day I hit it I've had constant headaches similiar to migraines which aren't exactly unbearable just reminding me they are there.

3za5d0,TBI,"Got beaten up 5 years ago and im sure i suffered a brain injjury, family and friends all kept telling me i was fine but deep down i was too scared to do anything about it as i felt alone! i still feel different to how i was before and since have probably caused a lot more damage due to abusing drugs. I did try to go to the doctors twice but they seemed to brush it off. I don’t know where to start or where to turn. I suppose ive been running away from my problems rather that comfronted them but i felt alone. I did try to tell my then girlfriend literally just broken up in september who did try to help but never gave me that final push. Reading this sub has finally given me the push that i need to get help and get things sorted if that is even possible!"
3z6byg,TBI,"I'm about 2 months into my 5th concussion and feeling pretty depressed about my chances for getting my symptoms to get all the way better this time, but I know it can take a while. I figured maybe chatting with other folks a little might help. I'm still at a point where I'm so dizzy I can't drive (or walk short distances a lot of the time) and have migraines 90% of the time, despite being in  vestibular rehab and already on pretty high doses of anti-seizure meds (mixture of depakote and long-acting topirimate). Soooo, hi!"
3yc5v3,TBI,"Do any others with TBI have trouble controlling your thoughts? I'm unable to stop thinking about a breakup, and someone suggested it was because of my frontal lobe issues with executive function. looking for strategies for help."
3y7qk8,TBI,"I got mine while breaking up a fight at work. A guy was getting strangled and I got him away from his attacker but while I was pushing him out of the room I got hit over the head with something heavy. I didn't lose consciousness and was able to subdue the attacker once I was facing him again. Over the next few days I started feeling really weird and having crazy tingling sensations on one  side of my face which was when I went to the hospital. Ended up on temporary partial disability, was fired for being incompetent (previously I'd had the highest rating in the department) and my GF dumped me because my personality had changed and I wasn't the same sweet, timid guy she used to like.

After that things got weird. I decided to take a couple of college classes and got A's in everything, 100s on tests and was passing a higher level math than one I had failed previously. I wasn't able to go to an university after that like i had wanted so I applied for a few random jobs and ended up taking some personality tests for a staffing agency.

Apparently in order to be a good staffer you need to be really aggressive, immune to rejection and ok with being threatened on a regular basis... Which is exactly how the personality change had made me. I was hired and promoted really quickly and even ran end entire branch for awhile.

Now I'm home again and found a job that will let me get my bachelors for free. I was recently at a funeral where i saw the manager that fired me from the job I was injured at. She asked what I was going now and I got to say that I went from doing her busywork to managing contracts with up to 500 employees.

Has anyone else gotten any positive side effects? As for negatives it is a little harder to write emails and my memory sucks now but I just keep a notepad at all times. "
3y42cm,TBI,"My (27F) TBI occurred in 2012 after I fell while rollerblading without a helmet, resulting in a decompressive craniectomy and a week-long coma.  Despite years of therapy and battling depression, I still haven't truly felt connected to other people ever since.  Has anyone else experienced this?

Part of this is due to partial deafness caused by the accident.  I've gotten a hearing aid and started studying lipreading, but I'm still unable to catch overlapping voices or quick speech.  I get tired of asking people to repeat themselves, and I'm sure they do as well, so I often just forfeit understanding to be less annoying.

My memory is the worst part, though.  I always forget what people tell me (despite taking a lot of notes), so I constantly feel as if I don't know them. Because of my location/background, I'm surrounded by a lot of academic people whose conversations I can't keep up with.  I feel really stupid in comparison and usually just tune out.  Honestly all I ever want to talk about is the accident again and again and again.  I feel like people stay away because I'm unreliable as a friend -- I can't keep secrets nor remember to stay in touch.  My efforts to go out and meet people have resulted in my gaining many acquaintances, but few real friends.

Thanks for listening! How do you guys cope with this? Have you had any luck with TBI support groups?"
3xu5wf,TBI,I am early in my recovery but my everything from my past life is coming back
3wb7yp,TBI,It was really easy when I was all fucked up and people were taking care of me. Now that I'm mostly back to normal it's really easy to get depressed and overwhelmed by starting over. That sucks. Need a job and whatnot.
3vyvub,TBI,"I've known my husband since HS and we have been together for 2 yrs. He had a tumor removed from his right frontal lobe almost 6 yrs ago and I was not present through it but I am here now and I am slowly becoming more and more unstable myself. I'm not sure I am handling anything right at this point and need help.


There are constant communication break downs, and I accept them. I constantly tell him I accept that he has all of these issues and I am trying to help, or just be there. No one else is, his family never took the time to truly give him the tools he needs to recover or even navigate through life on a somewhat normal level.  I've stayed constant and supported him more than anyone who was there before me.  He cannot work due to being on disability because he is considered to have a mental disorder, so I am sole provider. I am fine with this, I have always been independent. What he needed was someone like me who provided that stability so he wasn't a grown man in a room at his parent's house - which was a hostile environment regardless.  And what I needed in my life was someone who was so caring and attentive to me spiritually and emotionally, and he provided that. But lately I am feeling VERY resentful because I pick up a LOT of the slack that maybe I wasn't as prepared for as I thought.


I don't even know how to ask for what I am looking for. I don't want to make him sound like an idiot nor do I want to come across like someone who doesn't ""get it."" I'm just going to speak candidly and hope it gets the right message out there.


I have repeatedly told him, and in therapy, that I accept what he comes with. I am able to recognize misunderstandings, or when he reacts to something in a not so normal way. I see when he interacts with people that he is maybe not getting their intention. I kind of guide him through it. Some times I can't, and he manages fine. I'd like to also throw out there that he is one of the most smartest people I have ever met. There is very little I can ask him that he doesn't know. When we have an issue during communication I usually try and ask him what he thought he heard, or what he thinks happened, because his ability to discern sarcasm, or someone's intentions get skewed, and I can tell by his reaction that what I said/did came across wrong to him. When we have an argument I am on constant egg shells because I don't know if he is going to explode or not. I don't know if something he reacted to calmly will now be reacted to with an explosion. And in the end no matter how I handle it, it is my fault. He's one of the most self aware people I know. He is so in tune with his feelings, and with his behavior, but there are a lot of times he plays the victim and places blame. And when I say ""victim"" it is because it always is pointed out that he has it so hard, and he wishes he had my problems. From my side, I feel he actually is SO lucky to have the life he has, he survived, and has someone who supports him and gives him the ability to live a ""normal"" life. Better than most people who don't have his issues.  I am not saying I am an angel, I actually always like to throw out there that I don't think I'm the nicest person because I struggle with that on my own. But I am coming to a point of feeling very overwhelmed with always being blamed for his outbursts. If I do it this way, it's wrong. If I do it that way, it's wrong. But some days it's right. I never know what I am going to get. For example, if I see he is misunderstanding something and I try to recap what just happened there are times that he gets it right away and my stomach feels like a million moths were let free, there is such physical relief that it didn't turn into an argument. But then there are times that I look at him and cannot believe how misunderstood what happened was, and I feel like I'm in the twilight zone. I constantly ask ""is that what you really think I said?"" Because I am always trying to learn myself through his eyes, but it changes so much that it doesn't even matter.  The littlest thing can happen where something I say gets taken the wrong way and he gets elevated very quickly and he starts telling me that what I said is the reason he reacted that way. But some times he tells me it's HIS shit that makes him react that way. He never lets me finish my sentences, and over talks a LOT, which is one of the things he didn't do pre-rumor. He was super quiet. Now he rambles on and on and I have to cut him off. This makes it extremely hard to have a conversation because 1/4 through a statement I am making he goes to interrupt and answer what he thinks I am going to say, and then it starts a whole other argument because he didn't let me finish. I tell him even if he thinks he has the answer he needs to let people speak. I don't have a voice.  When he explodes it is VICIOUS. I get called names. He throws tantrums. He gets himself worked up. I was told I need to let him walk away, and I learned to do that with some time because that was something I struggled with, having someone in mid argument just walk away or shut you down is not an easy pill to swallow. But I have seen him go into episodes of not being able to breathe and it's scary, so I learned to shut my feelings off to let him relax. But there is only so much shutting off of one's feelings before they start to feel like they don't matter. He makes me feel more loved than anyone has ever before, there is no question there. He is genuinely on my side when no one else has been. But with that comes the other stuff, and the other stuff is hurting me more and more. 


I don't know what I am looking for here. I may need to talk to a therapist in person who is familiar with these things. I'd hate to have a failed marriage over something that I could have ran from but I did not want to abandon him like everyone else has. But I also cannot keep putting myself second.  


If anyone can relate, or has some insight, thank you. I'm sure I jumped around and I'm sure some stuff I said sounds callous and selfish, but that is not why I'm here. 


He takes seizure, thyroid and mood stabilizers. Recently he started seeing a new therapist who is interested in adding medication, she mentioned depression meds and was shocked that the meds I listed were all that he was on and that he has managed this far with those alone. When I first heard depression meds I thought that wasn't necessary but now I am thinking maybe that would help. He needs a little more self-motivation. I leave to-do lists daily, which he does with no complaints and most of the time goes above what I asked him to take care of, but I think he may need to be able to light his own fire.  Also he deals with a lot of anger and PTSD from childhood that definitely doesn't help."

3u9ys0,TBI,"Hey guys, so I'm new to reddit but recently I've been struggling a lot with something and I'm hoping some of you guys here might be able to help me with your own personal experience and such. At the end of August, my best friend was in a terrible car accident while on his way back to school. He was in a coma for about 5 weeks; he's been out of it for about 2 months now but is still traveling down the long road to recovery. He shows signs of improvement, although we have no idea if he will ever recover fully. He is starting to become more aware and is making attempts to speak, but still cannot. I know recovery from TBI's is a long and unpredictable road, but I am having a terrible time dealing with all of this. Like I said, he's my very best friend and I just can't deal with this loss. He was such a brilliant individual and my confidante. Not having him here kills me, knowing that he's suffering kills me, this is just a nightmare I don't know how to deal with. I just feel that I cannot come to terms with the fact that I may have lost my best friend, or at least the fantastic person he was. Any advice from those of you who have had similar experiences would be appreciated.

3p4tav,TBI,"Hello everyone. I am a TBI survivor. I was injured at work (I am no longer at work) and I have had several kinds of treatment.

Lately (I'm in the 2nd year of recovery) I have had feelings like I've inhaled water, sort of like I'm drowning how it feels when you go under too fast in a pool. It has been random and goes away within like a minute or two. I don't notice any pattern (time of day, situation, etc).

However in the past few days I have also had blood coming from my nose. At first I thought it was heating related (I live in a cold climate and the heat just turned on) however now I wonder if it is related to the drowning feeling, like maybe something in my brain is bleeding or leaking.

I cannot see a doctor before the end of November (I have tried, my insurance won't approve it).

I have a TON of symptoms, but all of them are from the brain injury itself and all pre-date the drowning/bleeding. I can't go to the hospital on a whim because it is SOOOO expensive. If I go once I will probably never repay it (literally!!).

How do I know what is and is not a true emergency? When I asked the ER they said that if any of the symptoms I've had for almost 2 years (dizziness, headaches, light/noise sensitivity, etc) are present, it's an emergency. However, I told them I have those anyway due to the injury. They said to call my regular doctor and ask. That was Friday and today is Saturday and I'm waiting for a return call.

I'm confused. I'm wondering if anybody else here has had this drowning/bleeding thing happen? I have never heard of it so I wonder if I am making too big of a deal over something."

3hdq29,TBI,"I got a bad concussion in September 2014 which took me out of work for 4 months.  I also lost my fiance during that time because he did not believe that I had a head injury because he ""couldn't see it"", so i had to move cities and move back in with my parents (I'm 23).  I went from owning a house to being back in my parent's basement.


I got my dream job in the new city working with my Dad.  I still had issues from the head injury, mostly memory, but I found ways to work around it and was doing well.  But at the end of April a chair broke when I sat on it and I've been off work ever since.


I can't read, which used to be my favourite pastime.  I can't play most video games, another favourite.  I can only watch certain movies because I get vertigo easy.  I can't get too worked up or think too hard or else I'll sleep for 12-14 hours to recover.  I get really angry easily.  I tried to drive my car and took the front bumper off just backing out of a parking spot, lost my iPhone 6 with no memory of where it went... and I have not improved in the slightest.


I basically sit in my parent's house, watching tv all day (which I hate) and sleeping when I can.  I had to start wearing glasses due to vision changes from the head injury (I had laser eye surgery a few years back, so this sucked) and I get headaches all the time.  Every once in a while I'll try to do something I used to and suddenly find that I can't.  Worse, my family is busy with their lives and I have no friends here.


I feel like I'm going insane.  I want my own space again and to just function enough to be happy but with no improvement I'm really struggling.  I struggle with anxiety and this has made it much worse so sometimes I wonder if my lack of energy is being made worse because of depression/I'm getting tired from all the anxiety.  

I used to be a really smart person and I feel dim-witted and slow.  I struggle with math, physically writing (my hands shake when I try and it exhausts me) and any type of problem solving.  I'm hoping I can maybe get some advice from people who are going through the same thing."

3ftimw,TBI,"A few months ago, I sustained a moderate concussion complicated by a double impact (a second concussion a few hours later). Ive had a slow recovery with lots of symptoms. A few weeks ago I noticed a chemical taste to my food.  I threw out what I was eating. I noticed this several times over the past couple weeks as well. Yesterday I asked my SO to try my food and he said it tasted normal.  It tasted strongly like Lysol or bleach. I realized then it is def not the food.  I have no idea what else could be causing this, other than my concussion. Has anyone else experienced this?  I have an appointment with my Doctor in a few weeks again and I will ask him but I was just wondering if anyone else has this happen?  "

I basically BLAME every issue at work or ""reason of doubt"" on my TBI, and I would like to start being more confident in myself and my actions.

3e8fo4,TBI,"I don't really know how to start this so I guess I will start with some back story. On august 8th of 2005 I was in a car accident where I was T-boned at 50 MPH on my drivers side door in that accident my head hit the window and busted it out, I blacked out for about 30 seconds. It was really difficult in the first few months before I was diagnosed with TBI constantly forgetting words, forgetting about important obligations, extreme anxiety, taking longer to process events or things I have learned, and overwhelming depression and feeling of uselessness. When I was diagnosed there was honestly a slight feeling of relief I mean honestly I would try to explain to other people what my symptoms where and I would just get blank stares and I started to feel crazy. So the diagnoses helped but I didn't really take anything from it. I just learned to sort of cope with my new problem by hiding it and if I felt embarrassed about my memory problems I would tell people that I had a TBI and that would be it. Well now I am here 10 years down the line and I just feel so alone... I feel like no one immediately around me understands the issues I deal with on a daily bases because I decided to put on a smile when it first happened and acted like nothing was wrong. I have tried reaching out to local TBI groups but the closest one is about 50 miles away and I am sort of afraid to show up. like I want to be open about this about its just really hard for me. and I think its because I just constantly push this down and keep trying to act like I don't have a problem. so I guess this post is my first step to fixing that.

3dljoa,TBI,
3cm1hf,TBI,"Hello my TBI brethren, 

This is one of my first posts to Reddit cause in my particular situation, I don't know where else to turn. I want to begin responsibly indulging in alcohol and tobacco products but I am afraid of bringing the subject up with my doctors or therapists. 

I had a fall from standing (nothing exciting) on April 19th and am recovering fine. I sped through inpatient rehab and just completed 1 of my 3 outpatient rehabs this week. I have not touched alcohol, wed, or tobacco products (cigarettes and hookah) since my accident out of precaution from my doctors. 

So my question to Reddit, how long did it take, after your TBI, to begin indulging in life's vices again and how did it affect your recovery if it did at all?

TL;DR i wanna smoke weed and tobacco and drink alcohol again, but fear that it will negatively impact my recovery. 

"
37463v,TBI,"This week I did way too much at work. I have a TBI related to medical trauma (intensive surgery, medications, etc) from 16 years ago that I have learned to manage on a daily basis. Usually I notice fatigue towards the end of the day and make sure to get rest and quiet and exercise. 

This week I had extra responsibilities at work and could feel myself overextending myself by working long hours and not having enough breaks. I teach and do many different tasks at work. 

By Wednesday, I was exhausted and by Thursday morning, I was weepy, woke up with brain fog and frontal lobe fatigue (kind of like a headache) and all I could do was exercise and try to take breaks throughout the day. It is finally the weekend and I have spent the past two days hibernating - social interaction is too much. I just need silence and rest, but I still feel the fatigue. What helps (besides not letting yourself get to this level of exhaustion?)

I am thinking of getting neuropsychological testing again and seeing if a doctor has any advice. "
370sza,TBI,"4 days ago, I was hit in the head at school by a kid with a laptop (Really hard) I was dazed and my glasses flew off, but i was able to walk to the nurses office and the nurse gave me ibuprofen but didn't say anything about it could be a concussion. I haven't really had any other symptoms except a almost unnoticeable headache when i do stuff like walking or watching TV. But I have hit my head really hard 2 other times, one I wasn't paying attention and hit a pole. The other was at a pep rally, I was kind of running up the steps to my seat and hit a really low basketball goal, and had a severe headache for the rest of the day. I never went to a doctor for these because my parents kept saying its okay and if i persisted in asking to go to a doctor, they would get angry. I have something called visual snow syndrome, which basically I see static, floaters, slight double vision on words and lights, starbursts. I also feel/hear a crackiling in my head, like a joint popping when I turn my head sometimes. I have a neurology appointment scheduled in about 3 weeks for a MRI scan, but I'm scared if I have serious problems they will just get worse. I've even got suicidal over this, and my parents say I'm obsessing if I bring it up. I just don't see how 3 blows to the head within 7 months is healthy. "
33u17d,TBI,"About a year ago I got hit by a car and experienced TBI that was probably severe. Not sure exactly what counts as severe, but I was in a coma for around a week. So I recovered fully and it's really weird to be around all these people that do have symptoms. I can't identify with any of the problems I see posted here. It's almost like I suffered from a totally different injury. I never really experienced typical TBI symptoms. I don't remember a couple of months after the accident, but from what I hear the injury never affected my personality or mood. So I just felt like sharing my confusion with you guys. Maybe there are people out there who have had similar experiences. "
32yir6,TBI,"Obviously exercise is healthy and beneficial.  But what about high-intensity workouts like crossfit, jogging, swimming etc?

On the one hand vigorous exercise promotes healthy organs and positive thinking.  On the other hand, it might lead to inflammation via increased heart rate and blood flow and overall stress.

What's your experience?  What is the opinion of top neurologists?"
30l5al,TBI,"my neighbour suffered a TBI a few years ago, and she seems to be in a pretty bad way right now. She had a bad cold and felt like every sneeze was going to trigger another brain haemorrhage and kill her, and now the family dog needs to be put down too. She's become very depressed and is isolating herself. I'm keeping in touch on texts and letting her know I'm here for her, but I'm quite worried. She lives with the spectre of death hanging over her, and although she jokes about making sure she's got nice underwear on just in case she dies, I can tell she's really frightened. My partner went over to speak to her a couple days ago and she was on the verge of tears and said some slightly inappropriate things (sexual) which makes me think The brain injury is ""active"" right now. I know that the charity headway are involved with her and are processing funding for her to see a counsellor. She has had a lot of other trauma in her life which doesn't help. I don't want to be too pushy as I know some days we make an arrangement and she has to cancel as she gets electric shocks in her head and has to go lie dow for days. I haven't seen her in person for months. Her son is trying to get her out of the house. I'm really asking what sort of support do people with TBI need from friends? She dosent know anybody else around here, she moved to the countryside for her health but this village is really unfriendly and her house is cold and damp. she was one of the only people who welcomed my family when we moved here. I really want to be there for her. Should I push her a bit harder, keep my distance until she's ready, or just go round there in give her an ""intervention""with a hug and a cup of tea."
2zjv1x,TBI,
2ygvxc,TBI,"Hello Reddit,
I have never made a post before, but I am in a really bad spot and don't know where to look for help, so I was hoping one of you could steer me in the right direction.
I am a 33 yo female that has suffered 2 concussions, the first one was on Nov. 11 2001 (the date is the only reason I can remember), it was a car accident, I was 18. The aftermath of that one seemed to resolve with time, but I was rather forgetful and was told that I was not myself for a few months. The more recent one was worse. I was 30 and took a spill down the stairs. I only remember what others said about it. I had a bit to drink that night and had my hands in my coat pockets and could not take them out to break my fall (about 20 ft.) so I landed on my face. I was told that I was out for awhile and that when I finally did wake up, I saw my reflection in the shop window that I had landed by and became hysterical (I had a couple of fractured teeth and was covered in blood). I was reportedly inconsolable, so instead of going to the ER, I was driven home. The only doctors I saw after the accident were dentists because I looked like a monster and felt I could not return to work until the face got fixed. That was my first mistake, no documentation of the accident and no clinical assessment. I don't know why I was so adamant about not being seen, but then again, my brains were soup.  Fast forward three years: I had ended almost all of my friendships with the people in that area and moved out of state for various reasons, real or imagined. I have been living in Houston, TX for about 2 years now, and can't figure out how to pick up the pieces, and I'm not sure if I am too crazy or incapable of doing on my own without help. I am unemployed (and am ineligible for unemployment benefits because I quit my shitty job to live f
off of fin aid while finishing school) with no income, have no car, and not much of an emotional support network. I have been attending low-cost therapy sessions aimed at treating depression and anxiety, but nothing has really come of them. I am living off of my last income tax return and hope to find a job before it runs out in 2 months, but can't seem to string 2 thoughts together well enough to put together a resume, and I worry that even if I could there is no nice way to say in an interview that I went crazy and my life fell apart, please give me a job now.  I barely finished my classes because it takes way too long to finish any kind of assignment, so even if I do miraculously get employed, will I be able to keep the damn job? I wish I could see someone to assess the damage, but have no insurance. Now it seems like at this rate, I will either just end up living under a bridge or become institutionalized. Sorry for the disjointed rant. Any suggestions or educated insights are appreciated."
2wwm84,TBI,"Hey guys - just wanted to share my story. This is my one-year TBI-versary, and I thought it might help somebody out to hear from someone who’s been on both sides.
I'm a resident physician in my final year of training, and one year ago I fell skiing while on my bachelor party. It was a stupid fall - I'm a pretty good skier, I was wearing my helmet, and I wasn't doing much outside of skiing fast – I hadn’t even been drinking since the night before. I was skiing on a blue for god's sake! Maybe it was because it was getting towards the end of the day, and I was looking forward to a beer and heading home. Maybe it was just my stupidity, a combination of speed and icy conditions and what have you, but I popped a ski, and went down – my buddy who saw it says I pretty much led with my head, and was a rag doll from the moment I impacted. I don't remember falling, though I remember much of the day earlier, but my memory doesn't resume in full until about a month later – everything else is in small moments, bits of scenes and rooms and occurrences. On the slope, I was intubated for a poor scene mental status, helicoptered to the nearby trauma hospital, pan-scanned, admitted to the ICU, extubated that night after my CTs revealed not much of anything…but I was still pretty out. My repeat head CT showed what looked like DAI, confirmed on my MRI that evening. My collar got cleared, my hands placed in mittens so I wouldn’t pull out my lines and Foley catheter. From there, I progressed, from obtunded and poorly interactive and barely arousable on hospital day 1 and 2, to a slowed, sleepy, lethargic version of myself.  I left the hospital after 5 days as an inpatient and went to an inpatient rehab, where I made leaps and bounds of progress, finally getting cleared to return home after a week and a half. 
I ended up needing to take over 3 months off from residency, after which I worked a princess schedule for the first month back– no overnights, plenty of time off between shifts, and lots of supervision. I eventually progressed, able to resume full duties, and now I’ve interviewed and offered positions for real jobs in the real world. 
Long story short, I find myself reading other’s stories and happy that I haven’t had many of the challenges that others faced. I didn’t need surgery, so no post-op complications. No medications, no depression, no visual issues. It was truly short-term memory that I struggled with the most, and even that seemed to improve with time. I got back to reading, to playing games, to challenging myself to move past it all. I was able to resume my duties as if little had ever happened. Most importantly, I was being able to get married a few months after my injury, no postponements, though the honeymoon had to be rearranged a bit. 
Anyway, I don’t want to toot my own horn, because I know, more than anything else, I am lucky – I know the statistics on DAI, how rare it is for someone to make a full recovery with no marked deficits. I know I had a lot of things going for me – a supportive family, spouse, friends, job. I know that years of education is directly correlated with recovery. I know that my helmet probably saved me from a depressed skull fracture and probably other intracranial hemorrhages.
I also know that it gets better – that the memory issues improve, that you can use your experiences to teach people about TBIs, to make people more aware of the issues faced by survivors, and the trauma it wreaks on their families. I’ve utilized myself as a case study, preparing lectures about TBIs, using my own CT and MRIs, even pictures my friends snapped of me unconscious on the slopes.  
Anyway, that was long, so I apologize, and I need to run to work. It feels good to talk about it.

2wrwme,TBI,Hey everyone.  I am an 18 year survivor of a severe TBI.  I am writing a book.  I will also be featured in the March edition of Prevention Magazine.  Hoping to bring awareness.  It is not just military and NFL players.  I too am the face of TBI.  Checkout www.tbichick.com
2wrv6a,TBI,"I have exhausted my options.

Background: Took a boxing class -> got bopped in the head a few times. Though a light hit to the head is what triggered the actual concussion.

The headache is constant though ranges in severity from a ""3"" to an ""8"", though it is typically a ""3"" or ""4.""

Have had an MRI of brain and cervical spine. X-Ray of Cervical Spine. No issues seen.

Have seen chiropractor, massage therapist, biofeedback psychologist, 2 neurology teams and cranialsacral therapist. So I am running out of options...

Poor sleep quality (feel like crap when I wake up) and prolonged cognitive issues like brain fog makes the headache extremely apparent to my psyche.

So these are the only options that have been left on the table for me. What I am really wondering is if Pamelor is just a pain masker or will potentially help cure my issues. I know antridepressants have shown some promise in helping with TBIs...but if not nortriptyline what else could help me actually recover from the TBI?"
2w6f1b,TBI,"Hello friends! How's everyone doing.
I've been okay, dealing with this day by day."
2w5j16,TBI,"Hey everyone,i apologize if this long but hopefully someone will read this,if not its nice to get it in writing.About ten years ago I had a series of head injuries that have had long lasting physical and mental effects.I have managed to work my life around the majority of them but one issue that really concerns me is issues with socializing and how that really diminishes my chances to start a relationship with someone.

Its hard to sum up my personality but I guess I can be seen as stoic or distant,before my injury I was very socially engaging but afterwards I became very introverted and flat.Its a hard thing to pin down exactly I seem to lack the desire to have small talk or socialize on any level,its not depression or anything either,when i had my injury its like that part of myself just dissapeard.I have issues converting feelings and thoughts into words so conversation is pretty much impossible.When Im in a social situation I never want to say anything,all conversation is extremely forced and although I can fake it  deep down I know it just feels like a script im reading.I can actually go to a social outing and converse with everyone,ask them about their job and their life and no one could tell the difference but deep down I know I'm completely acting and it feels really wrong and its extremely exhausting,not to mention manipulative.I know theyre not meeting the real me and it impossible to form true relationships like that,just playing a role to keep people to like you.I actually have one friend who understands my subtleties and we go for long quiet walks together,he see's me for who I am underneath the veil and he's great to spend time with but when it comes time for me to meet his other friends I just cant do it.

 The thing is Im still very intelligent,caring,present,and enjoy being around people but I dislike and am incapable of having natural regular conversation.Occasionally something will spark my interest but only if its philosophical or very abstract and its pretty rare that it happens.Before all this happened I was a warm welcoming person but now Im just a lump who sits on his computer or lays in bed all the time and it drives me crazy,I can make myself go out and do all the ""normal"" stuff that people do but it feel like I'm swimming upstream when I do.If I just flow with what I want to do in the moment I just play game,go for walks by myself,visit quiet places but deep down Im terribly lonely,all I want is someone to do these things with.

So my question is to anyone who can relate with social issues after a T.B.I,how do/did you meet people like you?It's been 10 years now and I've given up on trying to act ""normal"" and its actually been a big relief in a way as I feel like Im truly being myself.It feels like I've pulled off my mask and am presenting myself as I am  but I don't want to spend my life alone,its a pretty terrible prospect to have at 27.

Any opinions?"

2txd9q,TBI,"Does anyone else have temporal hollowing from a tbi related skull removal?

If so did you get offered plastic surgery to fix it or go to a clinic or just accept it and move on?

I have bad temporal hollowing after a craniectomy from brain swelling after I got attacked by some guys that beat me with a pipe. I had my skull out for 4 months and was in a 2 week coma so the muscles really really atrophied on that one side of my forehead above my ear and eye.

"
2sbi1v,TBI,"Without giving out too much information, I sustained a bad TBI ~3 years ago in a bad bus accident. Like, really bad.

I was told I'm lucky I survived. I'd say I'm superficially healed. I required ~40 stitches in the back of my head for a big gash and I still have scars on my back from shattered tempered glass finding its way into my shirt. If I had been sitting a different way (had my back to the window), I would've needed some serious plastic surgery or been killed.

Anyway. I went from never having headaches to getting them constantly. I've been on tons of medications; only Topamax did anything for me and even 150 mgs of that only makes them less intense. Three years after the fact, I still get headaches every day. I also went from being an A and B student to a D student. I was falling asleep in class even after full nights of sleep, getting distracted, and losing concentration.

I managed to graduate HS and get accepted to a couple colleges (majored in pre-nursing), but I did very poorly during my freshman year. I just couldn't keep up. I was always good at math; I needed some help sometimes, especially with geometry. I got a B or above in every math class in high school before my TBI, though. After it, I was repeating math classes and skipping to avoid facing the fact that I sucked so bad. I stopped comprehending math. Nobody could help me. College math was no different and was enough to make me contemplate suicide, so my parents made me drop out.

I've *never* been depressed or suicidal. I was a happy person before my TBI but now I feel trapped. I know I used to be smart. Now I'm positively stupid. I lost all interest for things I used to love, except for music. Besides music, the only thing I enjoy anymore is video games. I want to be a programmer. I want to make games. However, I'm so terrible at math and I can't memorize anything; programming seems totally out of reach.

I'm a firm believer that my TBI has changed me as a person. Is this even possible? I feel like I'm insane for thinking this. What else could have happened? I was so smart before and now I'm nothing. I had everything in front of me and it's gone now. I'm useless. It was like flipping a switch. As soon as I went back to school after my TBI, everything changed.

Am I crazy? Please help me?"
2pqtbk,TBI,
2pd7y4,TBI,"Eight months ago I was run over by an elderly driver. Long story short, the court cases will continue going on for at least a year, maybe two years or more.

In the meantime I've done lots of rehab and therapy and all that stuff, including returning to work. I started out with a very high IQ and a very taxing job in the medical field. I've been returned to work, and there are difficulties that I cannot deal with, such as making mistakes on medications and such--very serious mistakes (potentially) and by the nature of the agency I have to work alone 30 hours a week.

I've started several legal proceedings asking for accommodations after the initial requests were all denied.

So in short, I have about six different legal battles being fought right now, and I am continuing to go on with life, or trying to.

I live alone, I have no relatives or friends anywhere in this part of the world (I am not from here), and I am stuck, financially, medically, and socially from going anywhere else at least until one or more of my cases breaks.

I've done nothing wrong at all in the entire ordeal, and what sucks is that I am aware of that--if I had done something wrong, it would be ""easier"" to digest, I think.

I feel like I am being punished for being severely injured. But I wasn't ""severely injured enough"" for it to totally destroy me.

One of the things I lost in my brain injury was my negative emotions, and I have still not gotten them back. I still have blunted negative emotions, but most of them (depression, sadness, fear, anger, etc) are very reduced from what's ""normal"" and what I felt for 29 years previously. I know this, and it confuses me because I don't know where I feel fine because I literally CAN'T feel despair, and where I'm doing well (if that makes sense). My neuropsychologists don't know, either.

I've been to three brain injury support groups, but they're all for people who have suffered worse injuries. I started out with a very high medical degree and training and very high functioning so when I show up at these meetings I am usually asked in innocent wonder, ""Why are you really here?""

I'm lost about what to do. I feel like I have lost a big part of my life, my abilities, my world--but it is ""not enough"" to be like most folks with brain injuries and I am expected to keep working like normal in a field that requires 110% of a person when I don't even have 90% anymore.

I can't move or leave the area because I've lost so much money in the past 8 months (all my savings) dealing with the initial aftermath of being injured. I'm stuck and I don't know how to move forward.

For the record: I was told by one of the medical doctors that I had a ""mild traumatic brain injury"" but one of the neuropsychologists said it was a ""moderate traumatic brain injury"" because of the fact that I lost consciousness twice. I'm not sure if that actually matters much, really.

Life has basically stopped, and I'm still dealing with all the things I never once had before (memory problems, headaches, exhaustion, syncope, neural fatigue, visual strain, etc).

I know no one here has magic answers--I don't want to ask for that. I just want to ask for general advice, feedback, similar experiences, encouragement, etc...

EDIT: I do have a question. When you're in a situation where you need a break (fast paced, multi-layered, several things happening at once), but you can't take a break based on the situation (i.e. you work in an emergency room), what can you do?"

2mou4x,TBI,"I've been a lurker here for a while and I'm not sure this is the right place but I figured maybe you guys could help. I've been dealing with post-concussion syndrome from a baseball that hit me on the side of my head since July. The first couple of months have been hell as I've dealt with non-stop tension headaches, light sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, increased depression, panic attacks, and increased anxiety. For the most part, these problems have very slowly been getting better, but I still have one big problem that I was wondering if you guys know any remedies to. That problem is being in vehicles. I've been told I have vestibular problems and I'm going to rehab for that soon, but I for some reason I get very sick in cars, especially in city driving, and whenever I'm in a car for more than 10 minutes I start to feel dizzy and very weird. My issue is that I have a wedding that I'd like to attend but it is about 4 hours away by car/train and I have no idea how I'll do. I was wondering if you guys know any medications to help with the discomfort from vehicles and if you personally are having the same problems with vehicles after your TBI. Thanks in advance for your advice."
2mo4sk,TBI,"I'm probably about as recovered as I have ever been from ABI due to anoxia/hypoxia. (If I'm in the wrong place, let me know but it was in the list and I lurk :))

I feel better than I have since the respiratory failure that caused the lack of oxygen. I have been through 50% sight loss, blacking out, nystagmus, phantom sensory symptoms, confusion, disorientation and extreme mood swings. All of these are gradually on the mend and I feel pretty good.

What I am left with as a 'hangover' of sorts is a very disordered mind. I have gone back to university but I have dropped to 'C' grades from my old 'A' grades. Everyone is telling me not to be as hard on myself as I've been through a lot, I'm doing well to pass after my illness, etc.

I'm trying to maintain positivity and see it that way but as I am becoming more aware of my recovery, I am becoming more frustrated by what no-one sees.

My thought processes feel so disjointed, it is as if my internal monologue has tourettes. It is very hard to focus on one task and gain an overall view of something. I have lots of little views of something but the edges don't knit together. This makes my structural geology course a total bitch.

I struggle to finish my sentences still and often have to say something initially in a way that makes sense to me followed by a translation that makes sense to everyone else. As you can imagine, it feels a bit hard socially so I tend to not bother too much with that side of my life until I can get this sorted out.

I feel pretty bad bitching about this stuff as some of you guys have a hell of a lot worse to deal with but I'm hoping some of you have advice you can suggest as to how to 'train my brain' into more ordered thinking.

I can't seek medical advice as it was our National Health Service which caused my problems in the first place and they are denying my symptoms are from an ABI but are instead associated symptoms of my pre-existing fibromyalgia (go figure).

It was a neuro that said,""I am not saying that it *is* anoxic brain damage, but if it *was* it would look a lot like this."" and sent me a lot of literature about it on the sly.

Thanks for making it to the end. :P

2me8jl,TBI,"Hi all, 
I am an Occupational Therapy masters student and am hoping to work with TBI patients upon graduation. For a project I have to design a group geared for young adults with TBI. I am looking for any advice on what would be most helpful for you, some ideas I had were:

(1) A group focused on meal preparation where members would practice simple sequencing of making meals, cleanup, grocery shopping etc. 
(2) A group focused on financial management where members would practice recording all of their transactions, bills, forecasting expenses etc. 

ANY ideas would be really appreciated, thank you! "
2kbckg,TBI,I like things to be clean but it is to much of a challenge for me to make up my own bed so I leave it in a mess.  Do I have any other options besides sleeping in a sleeping bag? I just at least want it to appear asceticly pleasing.
2k7zdq,TBI,"Ever since my TBI I have an overactive bladder. Never had problems with this before, it's not a HUGE deal but it's a bit of an embarrassing problem to have. At first, I thought that maybe I just needed to work on training my bladder to hold more fluid, and I've been focusing on bladder training for the past few weeks with no improvement and today, I finally just realized that I probably have an overactive bladder. It varies by the day but I have to pee every 1-2 hours and when I go, it's a fairly considerable amount of urine (about 10-20 seconds of peeing). I probably need to ask a doctor about this, I'm pretty annoyed I didn't think to do it before. Just was wondering if others had similar problems? I'm fairly young in a new city and I don't have experience in knowing how to seek out a doctor so it's a hassle, but something I need to eventually learn how to do anyway."

2i6he9,TBI,"Another win for PTSD... 
Tried to sleep but PTSD veered it's ugly face yet again. Vivid images disturbing and cruel. Makes it hard to close my eyes for even a second. I tried to find someone to talk to via 7cups, thanks to the referral from a subscriber from this sub. But alas not a soul was either online or responsive.

It's funny... before the sun even set I found myself on the phone with a person from the crisis-hotline, if anything she made matters worse. Currently though I'm no longer suicidal, just stuck in this abysmal purgatory, my own personal Hell. 

""What did you use to do?/ How have you been coping thus far?"" I used to write, but thanks to other survivors, was deterred due to claims of plagiarism. If you experienced similar problems we should try to help each other, shouldn't we? Not try to claim: ""I came up with it first/ I complained about that earlier, you're just copying what I said...""

It's bullshit like that, that made me drop a certain TBI community I found VIA FB (before I found this sub). 

A combination of PTSD and insomnia that fades in and out on what seems like a weekly basis. Sleep is like a fantasy, a dream that'll never come true, thanks to my TBI. Hallucinations, though not as severe, still remain. All of my medical professionals can't give me any solid answers... Primary nor Neurologist or anyone in between. I had some therapists/counselors tell me straight up: ""I can't help you"" and things along the line of ""best of luck anyway"". Truly feel like a goddamn lost cause a majority of the time. But Mods and other redditors have been kind and helped show I'm not absolutely alone in this shit-storm. I do want to thank you all for that, silver lining I guess.  "

I don't know what it is, but I just feel down. I'm normally pretty extroverted. I enjoy being in the company of other people. But on those off days, I feel really uncomfortable around people. That doesn't necessarily mean that I want to be alone. I hate feeling lonely. But I also get stressed out by other people being there. I dunno. It's kinda hard to describe. Life is so god damn confusing. There's just so much about it that I don't fucking understand. This is just something I wanted to talk about and I wanted to be heard I guess. Well, shit.

29cb6j,TBI,"I am 3 years post MTBI. I still have memory/cognitive issues. Background noises are probably my biggest problem at this point. I avoid social gatherings as much as possible because enough noise/commotion will send me running for the hills. 

I can't concentrate. 2-15 min in to most any conversation/movie/class/book/ect I will find myself admiring the rug, studying the architecture, or reverse-engineering a chair. 

It's hard to process/calculate things. If I'm talking to someone and they ask me a question I wasn't expecting (or sometimes one that I was) I freeze up, think about it for an awkward 30 seconds until my head ""overloads"" and I forget what the question was and what we were talking about. 

I have been trying to re-learn to math I forgot (through khan academy) but so I only have the mental energy/processing ability to work on it for a few days every 2 months.

I know there's more but I can't remember anything else at the moment and I keep getting distracted by the light fixture. 

I need to get back into school. Last time I tried (last fall) failed miserably after 2 days due to my issues mentioned above. 

Has anyone had any success with any medications to treat anything I mentioned above? I see a neuropsychologist and I think we briefly spoke about medication a few years ago and at the time she seemed pretty anti-medication, so I'm not sure if asking her would do me much good.

27lh9c,TBI,Just as the title suggests.. I am planing on skydiving July 20th and am super excited. I talked to my neurologist about it and he was reluctant to sign off on me going skydiving but never said 'no' he just strongly advised against it. It still worries me when im thinking about the pressure of being 10000 ft up in the air and the effect it will have....Who has gone skydiving after their TBI?

Just thinking about it now Ill try and relay...Some context first so everybodys on the same level..

When i am listening to somebody (1) and the cogs are turning(2,) i find that inner voice (your subconscious?)that is suppose to be in the background working out what to say next, has flooded my head...Uggg so hard to explain...its almost like theres too much noise up there when i am thinking that it distracts me/ throws me off topic...I feel mentally drained just trying to describe my symptoms...if anybody has anything to say ill apprecitaed it."

Weird to explain,) but I was an avid guitar player- ishh so after the TBI I lost all prior knowledge of the guitar and music in general...I was playing for only 2 years or so but I felt as if I were progressing...cut to after the incident...I completely lost my ability to play. Not just physically, but mentally. I can barely keep time or a rhythm for more than a few measures to save my life.. feels damn near impossible...I doo slow the tempo down and play with a metronome (sometimes.)

Ran out of things to preoccupy myself with, I'm just tired but can't sleep. Roll with the punches but this no sleep deal gets old. To top it all off the pain pills were ineffective these past 24 hours. Damn my broken, well everything. Leg started acting up, then hip, then ribs, then jaw.

46f6km,TBI,"15 years ago I suffered a tbi while out riding an atv I went headfirst with no helmet into a tree and then the atv ended up on top of me. We were out in a very rural area it took one hour to get to the local hospital which was not even equipped to deal with my injury. In the ambulance I went into shock they thought they lost me a few times. I made it to the initial hospital then a larger city hospital I
 had open head wounds so many skull fractures I am still not sure of the actual number at least 14. 

I spent a lot of time in intensive care as many here did but really don't remember anything. I went home went back to normal life although school was much more difficult. I really had no ""after care"" only to take out the hundreds of staples in my head. My head looked pretty good the hospital hooked me up with a pretty decent plastic surgeon I thought all was well and for at least the last 15 years it was. 

Now I am noticing some major issues I am having terrible migraines very similar to what I was experiencing after my accident when I came home. I can also feel something strange underneath my scars maybe scar tissue? But its so painful. My mood swings are driving my spouse crazy and I have become some what of a loose cannon I will admit that. I am also having issues regulating my body temperature I can deal with the other stuff but one minute I'm having chills then I am sweating profusely there is no norm I never feel right. I have gone to my regular doctor who really doesn't understand but I am hesitant to go to a neurologist. I haven't seen one since I was in the hospital but I don't want to waste their time. Should I just bite the bullet and see one or is there some other type of doctor I should see? I really appreciate any and all feedback!"

44f017,TBI,"I'm an emt in la county, I've been doing it for 3 years. I'm very blessed to be here I was in a coma for 13 days the doctors thought I wouldn't be able to recover but I'm here doing great :) 
I can't remember anything about what happened that night, the most I remember is all the vivid dreams I had during my coma. I'm having problems with my speech and smell  but my recovery is going great thanks to my loving family. Last year was not my year. On May my girlfriend and I argued and she called the cops saying I hit her. Apparently I had to get taken to jail when I didn't do anything. I ended up breaking up with her in November becuase I found out the dmv was taking my ambulance license. I was still with her even though she was not willing to testify in a trail saying the truth because she would get in 'trouble' for doing that to me. The court charged me with disturing the peace with loud noise that's gonna be dropped with I complete a 50 week class for domestic violence!  Well now I'm prolly going to get fired from the company I work for. I have to one to talk to her because of her but I'm ok with that tbh becuase I know she's a liar. Lately I've been asking why all this has happened to me. I've always been an honest man, I started in the navy as a corpsman and now I'm here but I know I'll be okay hopefully.

44699f,TBI,"I don't know if this is going to make sense.

Post injury (2 years) I have been having communication issues. Most have not been too problems. But now I'm trying to do a harder one.


I am in a car and I think, and say: ""Turn right at the light""

But what I actually say is: ""When we get there, I'm ordering fries""

So the person with me goes ""Fries sound good"" ...which I take to be a stand alone comment.

See how the ""turn right"" part got lost? and there's not a clue in the conversation for either of us to know there was a problem?

Some part of my brain was thinking ""fries"" but I don't ""feel"" that part, it's like it's down a hall, and all I hear is the sentence forming.

Fries and driving directions, no big deal. but I have been doing this in doctors appointments, with attorneys, everywhere. It's not every time I talk, but when I'm getting a lot of stimuli, it's frequent.

At that point, there is nothing to tell me that the thought I am having and the words I am speaking don't match.

Much of the time the other person's response doesn't make sense. I tell them we are having two different cobversations, but they don't get it. I tell my doctors that nothing I say makes sense to anybody else, but they think it does.

My neuropsych is having me do a bunch of stuff in writing, because that works better, and I can go back and unscrew the errors, I think.

How do I know? I called our vaccum cleaner ""lawnmower"" for 6 months before someone told me I was doing it. I just thought ""lawnmower"" meant ""vacuum cleaner""

I've got good doctors, but I'm freaking out.

Before the injury I was skilled at public speaking, teaching, all the stuff. But now I can't even trust what I say.

I can't remember what else I had going. my short term memory impairment is big, so I lose a lot of stuff.

so what do I do?

If I can't rely on myself, how do I sort anything out?"

3yx23w,TBI,"I sustained a TBI 17 years ago. I'm starting to ask myself some questions about it.  I don't know whether it would be considered mild or moderate.  I hit a tree on my bike, wasn't wearing a helmet.  I didn't immediately lose consciousness.  It wasn't until they were taking me from the ambulance to the hospital that I passed out/fell asleep.  My mom told me that the doctor told her that I didn't actually lose consciousness.  He said that when children go into shock they often fall asleep, and that isn't the same thing as losing consciousness.  Does that sound right to you or does that count as losing consciousness?  I don't remember how long I was out of it before I came to.  I remember being wheeled into the hospital, and I have the faintest memory that I had some awareness during that time.  I don't know if I was in and out of consciousness or if my memory from that time was lost due to the injury.  The next thing I remember is waking up in the ICU.  I don't know if it was the next day but I feel like it was.  It could have been late afternoon of the same day though.  Ultimately what happened is that my forehead was shattered, I had an epidural hematoma, bifrontal cerebral contusions, and a torn dura mater.   I had to have craniotomy surgery to fix it.  For the next couple of years I lost my sense of smell, but I ultimately regained it.  My personality was different, while before I was a happy and sociable kid, afterward I was withdrawn and socially anxious.  I was depressed afterward.  I also had fine motor weakness.  All of those symptoms are gone now, but I still have really bad ADHD like symptoms, along with severe mental fatigue, executive function problems, and anxiety.  Does that sound like mild or moderate TBI to you?  "

3uwj4v,TBI,"Hello, everyone!

My husband was hit by a drunk driver while he was walking to get on his school bus.  He had to learn to walk and talk all over again, but from what I understand, he was never put into a rehab facility because his mom didn't want to put him in a place an hour away from their home.  I know that he still went to therapy sessions, but he was living at home.  

He has some cognitive issues.  He's a slow thinker and doesn't have the maturity level of a 29 year old.  He's also had a couple of brain aneurysms, has developed epilepsy, and has bipolar disorder.  His fine motor skills suck as does his memory.  I basically feel like I'm raising a grown child some days, but that's the life I chose with him. lol.

His mom basically coddled him growing up and didn't give him any responsibilities or have him take responsibility for/of himself.  This has become a huge source of contention for us.

Anyhow, I was really wondering... What do others who have suffered the same things as he has done for employment?  He's never able to hold a job for very long, especially if they require him to think and/or move quickly or for him to remember things.  We really don't know anyone else like him, who has both TBI and bipolar which each effect every aspect of his life in different ways.

He is on permanent disability so there is a little bit of income on his part.  All I know is that he can't spend the rest of his life around the house playing WoW.  I need my birdie to fly!

Any thoughts/suggestions?"
3uwg9t,TBI,"I got mine from snowboarding 2 years ago, I'm finally getting back on my board this winter. I got my ataxia and muscle control in order enough to hopefully ride okay. 

My main question is this: If you are playing sports again, do you do it as well as you've done it before? I'm asking because I'm starting to try and run again and I've come to realize that it's probably one of the hardest things in the world for me at the moment. It was like running with dead weight. I have to try and get some decent muscle back... which makes me wonder if it's even safe to run without any sort of muscle and I should just work at the gym for now. However, I've found that it became a little easier as I continued ""running"" lol I found out that I wasn't lifting my legs as much and started focusing on the high knees motion, and it got better. 

So how about you guys, have you started sports again? What were you greatest strengths and weaknesses? What are you doing to get better?"
3qmuhk,TBI,"Hi /r/TBI 

I plan to visit a friend of the family who had two brain aneurysms.  I would like to visit her in the hospital, and her husband has already given me the ""what to expect"" debriefing, but there were a few things I wasn't comfortable asking him, that I was hoping this forum could help me with.

She is now quadraplegic and cannot speak yet, so the conversation is going to be fairly one-sided.  I am nervous that perhaps she will not want visitors that day, or would like me to leave but won't be able to communicate this, and will be literally stuck there listening to me rattle on about things she doesn't care about.  How do I pay attention to her, and make her feel included when she cannot tell me how she feels, what she's interested in, etc?   It must be terribly frustrating for her, and she must have to listen to a lot of boring things!

Also, I would like to bring her something- since she cannot move or communicate, that rules out a lot of things like magazines, books, ipods, food, etc.   I was thinking about bringing her something that reminded her of home, like a stuffed dog that looks like her dog...but then I worry that might make her sad, since she will never get to go home again.

Perhaps someone here can give me the benefit of their experience and tell me what you wanted and needed most when you were in hospital or rehab?  I want to be supportive and make it a pleasant visit for her.

3pq57m,TBI,"The title explains why I am here, and I apologize if this post is somewhat off-topic--it was just the only subreddit I really think is appropriate to post. I have been the girlfriend of an Iraq combat vet for about a year now. He has been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and very recently diagnosed with a TBI. I didn't know him before the service, and we met under odd circumstances. Anyway, we are now living together and I jumped right in with a pretty good idea of what I was getting into.. I just lack the strength at times. I myself suffer from depression and anxiety, but keep positive thoughts circulating between us as much as possible to keep us both happy. I already feel like we're married because once he finally let me in, it opened a floodgate because I had already tried so hard for him to just give in and take a chance on a relationship. His former wife cheated on him while he was deployed, and dated a girl soon after that destroyed him financially and mentally/emotionally, so he was already very untrusting before we became official. He is the perfect boyfriend at times. He is affectionate (holds me every night, all night, cuddles with me all the time, etc.), supportive (emotionally and financially), goofy, fantastic at sex.. which always helps, right? The things that he tells me that are on his mind and heart are what get me the most. It means the world to me that this man has opened up and allows himself to be completely transparent, but some things are very hard to hear, as you can imagine. He's told me everything that happened to him that was very traumatic, including things he has only ever revealed to his battle buddy. I have always listened and offered my support in every way that I can, and I know it makes him feel secure. As I stated earlier, he can be the perfect boyfriend at times. But the few things I discussed, affection, goofiness, etc. turn off like a SWITCH. I've never seen anything like it. It's like a mood swing from hell. Any little thing sets him off. His brain injury supported the fact that his frontal lobe is damaged and that is what causes a lot of it. The mood swings are awful. There are days when I feel like he is a totally different person and while I hurt myself, I worry about him and his 3 year old son, which he has 50/50 custody of. I know he is too little to understand why his daddy is the way that he is at times. I try my best to be a mother to him, and I think that I do a great job because he treats me like his mother (his real mother is not fit to parent, to put it lightly). His relationship with his father is just like mine.. feels like two different men. He mentioned once to me when I joked with him about something... ""Be careful what you say to me.. if it weren't for you, I'd probably kill myself."" He said it so suddenly and snapped right back into a normal conversation that it didn't even hit me what he'd said until after the fact and we were laying down that night about to fall asleep. Tonight, we shared a long car ride and he confessed that he feels ""sparks"" of emotion, in which he does the things I described such as the affection and being the ""perfect boyfriend."" He attributed a ""spark"" to his last minute decision to keep me in his life and make things official with me after he'd told me 2 weeks earlier that he just couldn't invest in a relationship. The ""sparks"" are what keep me going, but sometimes they don't happen for weeks. It's hard on me. And I love him so much.. more than I have ever loved another person (even my ex-husband). I couldn't imagine my life without him and I wouldn't consider leaving for a second, never have. I guess I am just reaching out for support or possible advice on how to make it through these days better. He never fails to tell me he loves me at the end of the day and I know he appreciates me because he tells me that as well, but I just feel very alone because this isn't an average relationship that I can seek advice from friends. Sorry for the wall of text and my scattered thoughts."

3hikmr,TBI,"I suffered a TBI in 1998.  I graduated college a year ago with a 2.9 GPA.  My plan is to take a couple of years off before I start grad school.  2.9 isn't very competitive, but the reason I did so poorly has everything to do with my TBI.  Are there legal or other types of resources that can help compensate for my poor GPA in light of my TBI? "
3h9tv5,TBI,"Before my accident and return home from the hospital, I was more complacent and agreeable. Upon my return home, I was told not to lift anything over eight pounds and not bend my back at all so the vertebrae would continue recovering from their fractures as well as proper alignment to the compressed vertebrae. Understand, I have given birth to two children at home. The first of the two, I PURPOSEFULLY AND WILLFULLY was the one to catch her head. So, the words “can’t” and “need help” are rather foreign concepts. Having restrictions from the hospital which my husband enforced with tender loving care was quite an adjustment to which I did not take kindly.

Six days after my return home, I realized I could not smell. Dan invited me to go to a movie. He took a shower followed by picking up a glass bottle from the glass edigiere in the bathroom, spraying cologne on himself, and clinking the bottle back into place. I HEARD THE CLINK, AND I KNEW WHAT IT WAS. I was happy and giddy inside to think of my husband putting on cologne for me. While watching the movie, I nestled into his shoulder pocket and turned my head to my right to whiff the cologne. There was nothing. I tried to smell the scent more than once and I couldn’t. Upon our return home, I hunted the house for things I could possibly smell: dish detergent, laundry detergent, shampoo, soap, etc. Nothing. It was gone… and still is gone.

Cooking for the family changed. I had no gratification through smell that things were cooked well and delicious. A month or two later, I cooked my favorite sauce that Olive Garden uses: it’s with their dish Portabello di Ravioli. The secret ingredient is smoky gouda cheese, and it was always so scrumptious to eat it. I had made it once previously years ago by finding a web page hacking the recipe. Only now, I eat gluten free, so rice was the starch instead of some form or other of pasta. It was that night I learned what else lack of smell causes: lack of most tastes. I was so excited to have prepared this for my family and a late celebration to myself that I was home, and surely home cooked food is better than hospital food. NOT! Not anymore.

I developed a voice per se that I never have had in my life. I was taught that if you have a different opinion and share it, that’s disrespectful and dishonorable. Well, it is between the TBI bringing my emotions more to the surface, as I used to “stuff” all my emotions along with slowly losing one complete sense: smell in addition to most of another sense: taste. My husband compares this experience this way. It’s as if I had one hundred pennies. Then, after returning home, I understand within a week that I lost twenty-five. THEN, I LEARN I lost TWENTY-FIVE MORE. So there is this urge to KEEP FROM LOSING any more from my life! I haven’t even mentioned how my parents reemerged in my life while I was in the hospital and then decided to isolate me once again within two months of returning home… more pennies that I seemed to have gained only feeling that I had lost that amount of pennies and more, as THIS I am sure was the last time my parents will ever be in my life again.

The outcome is to appreciate the pennies I have and to understand NOT ALL PENNIES ARE WORTH THE SAME! For instance, Indian head pennies, are worth more than the ones with Abraham Lincoln on the head of it.

Dan understanding this has helped him be ableto relate to me and remind me of pennies having different worths and reminding himself that there is a battle inside to not lose more, while reminding me of how the things that matter the most, I still have: my husband and family.. and they are worth far more than other husbands and other families."
3h6i0j,TBI,"Just wondering if anyone is in the same boat, suffered a severe tbi in September 26th 2013 when I was 19, 2months later everything was going well...

Relearned the basic functions and was ready to go home... then I lost all feeling in my feeling in my right side,almost slipped back into a coma, woke up to discover I had a shunt in me and that I will more than likely need it for the rest of my life, after a month I was back to basics and out of the hospital doing therapy for 5 months( OT,PT, and Speech) did well with that but still had issues with my memory so I don't remember much. Been dealing with headaches/ migraines every day, trying to figure out what is causing the headaches with my ""team"" we thought it was my shunt.

So we got a shuntogram and discover my shunt is only working at 53% (50 means it isn't working so basically it wasn't)

When we found that out my neurosurgeon issued me to get a new one, so I went under the knife for a 5th head surgery in a year ( 11 surgeries total I believe)

Surgery went well and I got my new programmable shunt in me! Woohoo my headaches for the most part are go-...Oh wait never mind they're still here and got a little worst, still only effecting my right side(behind my right eye and right side of the head). I'm 21 now and have an event coming up with my friends that I don't even know if I should go to just because of these headaches and fatigue I get from them, been hopeful for so long and now I'm starting to lose it.. I know how serious TBI's are and how long they take, I just thought I'd be back to being able to do stuff 
Sorry for the long jumbled post, I don't want sympathy I just needed to let this out, hope everyone is doing well on their own journey!"
3gzd95,TBI,"My SO has an issue since his injury that I am just not sure how to deal with.  He can't seem to let small things go.  Here's an example:  About 4 months ago, he purchased an avocado when we were grocery shopping.  A day or two later he went to get it out of the fridge and found that it was not there.  My daughter had eaten it.  Just last night we had yet another tiff about the avocado.  It makes it worse when I tell him that I don't feel like it's a big deal or that he needs to let it go.

He mentions this an average of once a week and frankly, I'm tired of hearing about it, sick of arguing about it.  Sometimes his anger gets to near rage level over this and other things that seem ""small"".  

This is just one example.  Before his injury, he never used to hang on to small things like this.  He was one of the most easy going people I've ever met and this would not have been a thing.  I'm not sure how to handle it, how to talk to him about it, etc.  

Do any of you find that you hang on to things like this since your injury?  If so, what is the thought process?  What do you do to release the thoughts?  Is there anything I can say or do to help?  I'm trying desperately to learn and understand.

I recently returned to my job (part-time) in June, and have been transitioning more and more to normal life.  This past weekend, I agreed to go on a camping trip and on the way back from the site, the driver of the car I was in hit a curb going 25-30mph.  The car kept going forward on the road, but there was a significant jolt that shocked everyone inside.  Now, no one else in the car has any symptoms of a head injury, but I feel like I am right back in the week after my initial TBI.  I can't focus, I'm incredibly sleepy and I'm emotionally a wreck.  

How do you all deal with subsequent insults to your brain?  How do you separate an exacerbation of symptoms from a new injury?  I am terrified of going back on disability but equally afraid of working through what may be a new concussion.  "

3901r8,TBI,"Hi r/TBI.  Please let me know if there could be a better subreddit to post my question.

My boyfriend suffered a severe TBI August of 2014.

His recovery has been excellent.  His speech is a bit slurry and he has vision problems that sometimes affect his balance and visual/spatial perception. However, he is still intelligent and sharp, with no memory problems or trouble with social skills.  Overall he's doing great.

Since the injury he has had problems maintaining an erection.  He was put on Keppra after the injury for seizure prevention, and weened off 6 months later (February).  During that time he had no problems with getting and maintaining an erection, so clearly the med played a big part.  Unfortunately in March he had a seizure, so he went back on the meds and erection problems have come roaring back.

Has anyone else had ED problems after TBI and/or from seizure meds?  Is there another medication that could help us?  

Thank you."

33odrj,TBI,"Hi everyone.  I suffered a TBI when I was 9 years old.  I'm now 26, but it still affects me every day.  In the past I was told I wouldn't be able to go to college, but I graduated last year.  It was incredibly difficult.  There is nothing so frustrating as working 5 times harder than any other student, and only being able to get a C, while everyone else gets As.  Despite my hard work, I was only able to manage a 2.9 GPA.  I am very proud of myself regardless.  I am a very ambitious person.  I want at least a Master's degree.  Realistically speaking, if I struggled so much in my undergrad, grad school would be absolutely impossible.  That is why I'm taking my time.  I'm waiting for a miracle.  Part of me wants to be brave and chase my dreams, but the more realistic part of me is afraid of crashing and burning.  If I started grad school, only to fail or have to pull out, I can't imagine anything more devestating.  I have a few questions.  Do you know of any strategies I can use that may help me be more effective in studying and working?  Focus, initiating work, and processing information are all very difficult for me.  Also, are there any TBI survivors out there with advanced degrees who wouldn't mind sharing how they did it?  Lastly, what about the process of applying to schools for someone with a TBI and a less than stellar GPA?  What can I do to compensate for my GPA, and does my TBI potentially give me any cards I can use to my advantage?  Any advise, or stories would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.  "

I was without oxygen for long enough that I was blue when the paramedics arrived.

Since then, my memory is shit. I can study and study and study for a test, attend class every day, and remember nothing. I don't remember if I've payed bills or done certain things. My memory completely blanks out. 

I can remember everything from before my accident, but it's seeming like I can learn nothing new. I asked my neurologist about it, and how long it could take for my brain to start recovering, and he just laughed and shook his head.

2uds0y,TBI,"Hi guys,

Long story short - my brother suffered a severe TBI after falling 4 storeys over a balcony on Halloween. He had a bifrontal decompressive craniectomy a few days after his injury due to swelling in the brain and he's been living without basically his forehead to the middle-top of his head for the past three months.

He gets very lightheaded when he stands up and he fainted on Christmas (the first - and now only - time we let him walk anywhere alone. And it was just 15 feet to the bathroom). Luckily, there was no further injury or damage although the first 10 minutes after coming to he couldn't speak. He continues to get lightheaded and at least once a week since Christmas we've had to ""catch"" him when he starts to faint. 

He lost approx 30ish pounds in the first month in ICU. He's put back on 10 of those and obviously we're working to put the rest on but it has to be done at a steady rate apparently. I'm assuming this plays a part in the lightheadedness. He's not on any meds or painkillers or any of that. His blood pressure is somewhat low, but that's genetic as my whole family has low blood pressure and gets lightheaded (happens to me at least once a day standing up).

My question is whether anyone who had experience with craniectomies has had similar lightheadedness? And whether it gets better with the cranioplasty surgery, once you have that part of your skull back? We are hoping to get my brother's back in in the next few weeks but doctors have not been able to give us any reason for the lightheadedness and they seem to think we're just a clingy family more then anything, ""interfering"" with his rehab. But if he falls and even lightly hits his head, it can kill him. Very easily. So we just want to find a reason and hopefully solution to the lightheadedness so we at least don't have to worry about his fainting all the time on top of every other hazard out there.

Thanks in advance!!!

TL;DR: Brother gets lightheaded and faints after decompressive craniectomy. Still missing skull. Does this get better when he gets his skull back?"

2sqne2,TBI,"I had a brain injury almost ten months ago.

I have returned to work in a high-stress (emergency-room like) situation. There are literally no free minutes for breaks or downtime, and I work alone.

I was super ""high functioning"" before, and I think my doctors see ONLY my improvements.

But I swear to God, things move so fast and loud and involve so much pressure (life and death) that I feel like I will just drop dead from stress. My brain just cannot handle it. Twice I have thought I had seizures but it was really Neurally-mediated Syncope (totally fainting and losing consciousness) due to the high neural demands.

I told my employer, my doctors, my neuropsych, my lawyers. But all think I am ""fine"" because I started out high-functioning.

But I am literally afraid the stresses, the need for money to live, the lights, noise, pace, all of it, is going to kill me.

I told my neuropsych and he said I need weeks or months of cognitive rest. But I cannot afford it no matter what calculations I use. I even considered living in a boarding house. I have no relatives with houses, money, or respurce (and I am not from this part of the world anyway)."
2sjng2,TBI,"Hey everyone,

 I need to make a very important decision quickly, and was wondering what amazing advice all of you smart folks at reddit have to offer. About one year ago I experienced a traumatic brain injury, making it very difficult to exert myself mentally (classic symptoms like mental fatigue, poor concentration, etc). Anyways, I wrestle for a prestigious D1 university, and because of this brain injury I had to leave the wrestling team as well as take a reduced course-load. I even dramatically changed my lifestyle by going 100% sober, eating healthy, meditating, and partaking in daily light exercise. This has been going on for a while, but like many people who have experienced brain injury, I am still noticeably symptomatic and recovering. It has been almost one year since my initial injury, and now I am a senior about to enroll in my last semester of college. 

Anyways, I want to wrestle again sooo bad. Wrestling is the reason I am where I am, and I am who I am, so it is obviously a large part of my identity and my self-esteem. There are only two months left of wrestling season, but it would mean the world to me to be able to finish out all four years of D1 wrestling. The risks, of course, are pretty high. Another concussion could really ruin a lot of things for me. I also want to one day go to medical school, but I need to boost my grades by having a really good academic semester this spring. Wrestling, on top of still be symptomatic from my brain injury, will also make school work very difficult. 

From all of this so far it seems like a pretty straightforward answer to not wrestle, to continue recovering, and to focus on getting good grades so med school could be a possibility in the future. However, there is one thing that is also driving this decision towards wrestling, and it’s the fact that I feel driven for the need to take a risk. I’m sick of taking the safe way out all the time. I want to take a risk, and I want to live a habitual lifestyle where I take risks for things I love instead of always taking the easier and safer way out of situations. So what do you guys think? Should I wrestle for the next two months, and risk another brain injury and bad grades, or should I take the safe road by not wrestling and just focusing on school? I’m very confused right now, and I need to make this decision in a couple days so I really appreciate all of your feedback!! Thank you!"
2s2nrh,TBI,"Hello, I would greatly appreciate it if anybody who is currently in college, and has sustained a concussion or mTBI to please take this survey.

http://setonhill.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_9LJfdmpCs0XusW9

It is for my Honor's capstone project at Seton Hill University, I am conducting an anonymous online survey through Qualtrics on college age students who have sustained concussions during their time in college. This study hopes to determine which portions academic accommodations provided by the student's home university are helpful for students, and in what other ways the student may be accommodated to best maximize their return to the classroom following a concussion or mTBI. In addition, this study seeks to determine if there is a relationship between one's academic load, major, and ability to return to the classroom following a concussion or mTBI.

So, if you have sustained a concussion during your time in college, and are currently enrolled in college, I would greatly appreciate it if you would take the survey that I have linked below. If you have not sustained a concussion during your time at school, but would still like to help provide control data that would be appreciated as well.

If you currently have concussion symptoms, please do not take the survey.

Thank you to all that participate.

Also, I encourage you to pass this link along to others who may be interested in participating.

2rhxe7,TBI,"I look pretty normal most of the time. My eyes are often half shut dur to migraines and fatigue.  I don't function or process the same. Everything takes more. 

I'm not stupid just speak slow and make sure I am not distracted. How do you explained to people what it's like? 

Some that I use:
1. It's like being drunk or highon drugs. Can't focus, process or react as sharply.
2. It's like living in a high intensity video game. The stress and pressure of those levels is a lot.
3. It's hard to explain.

I probably. Say other things but that's what I have for now. People typically respond with that's how they feel and they don't even have a brain injury.

2q4fxg,TBI,"I like ranting, but I think I suck at it. Here goes.

So I was hit by a FedEx truck on April 21, 2010. It was heavily raining, so there was no evidence that it was the driver's fault. Basically, FedEx settled for a ridiculously tiny amount, but that's a story for another day.

The impact led to countless broken bones and death, but the good FDNY medics breathed life back into me. So I was alive, but I had a hemorrhage, which led to some of my right-side temporal lobe being removed; and this led to a 26 day coma.

When I woke up, I was apparently unresponsive for a while, but a rehabilitation center (Helen Hayes Hospital) accepted me on account of me youngness. The first few weeks are hazy, but I remember reading Angels and Demons. I feel that reading a book early on helped save me. Unfortunately, it's the last book I fully read.

I was in a wheelchair while inpatient, and I couldn't speak. When I came home, I could walk but not fully speak. I still go to ST, but I've improved a great amount. The only physical problem I have is slow movement of my right arm, but I don't really work on it.

So about 2 years after I got home, I picked up cigarettes again, which is really unfortunate, and I picked up pot again, which I'm really thankful for. I've retained most of my friends, but I have noticed that friends are fickle. The ones I've lost are due to political differences.

However, I've noticed a change in thinking. Maybe I'm more child-like. I felt like a newborn as an inpatient patient, a toddler when I came home, and I've been catching up. For now, I am mentally in my early 20s; but I'm 27. Good enough.

I seem to have no cognitive problems. In fact, I had cognitive therapy, but she canceled it because, as I said, I seem to have no cognitive problems. This actually worries me a bit. After such a severe TBI, I wouldn't expect to be this ""normal."" 

Once again, I've noticed a mild change in thinking, but I can't place my finger on it. Could by psychosomatic. 

I'm having difficulties with relationships. As in, I haven't had one in over 5 years. I'm not bad-looking, but I am weird sometimes. I think I'm weird on purpose, to challenge myself, or to be liked at my worst first. I don't know. I'm lonely, but I have many friends of both sexes. I don't even think I'm ready for a relationship, especially because if I'm in a relationship, I want it to last. I feel like I just need to get laid for now, and I feel like a scumbag saying that.

This is what I sounded like almost A YEAR after the coma:

Before my injury I played college soccer and I used to snowboard. Since it has snowed in my area I have been really bummed. My rehab team has been trying to help me and my family find alternatives to do. Especially when I got really frustrated in OT and had like a meltdown because I wanted to go outside... I can't even control my emotions anymore lol (I don't remember last winter)

I am planning on doing adaptive skiing in New Hampshire.

2n8rzm,TBI,"After I received my TBI I was unable to distinguish what caused what symptoms. Dizziness, clumsiness, terrible vision, they all blurred together.

After months of trouble I was prescribed an eyepatch. The first time I put it on, I swear I almost cried. The relief was so immediate, so profound. With my poorly functioning left eye out of the picture it was so much easier to walk around, manage stairs, look at things, etc... You know, the things that were an accomplishment when you were three?

It's true that depth perception is a problem, but much less than having a bad eye feeding me bad information. Without the vertigo, without the shifting field of view, the net results are a good deal.

I was taken off of the patch for a couple months and struggled without it, thinking I was progressing or something. My doctor had given me the option of wearing it or not as needed, and I stubbornly thought I would be backsliding if I went back to it.

A couple days ago, my work environment changed and I am forced to use a non-accessibility-adapted computer at work (my employer is strongly anti-disabled) and I decided to try the patch again.

Again, the relief was instant.

I am fed up with everything being a process of me accommodating my lost abilities, laying back and accepting my lost accomplishments. I am grateful for this one thing that actually helps.

So what if kids ask if I'm a pirate? Or I feel a little silly looking? At least I'm not squinting and tilting my head trying to figure out what I'm looking at, or walking into objects."

2h07so,TBI,"He was in a coma from February 23-Mid April of this year. Once he started to regain consciousness his progress seemed through the roof. He had to relearn how to walk,  talk,  and use his right hand.


He started his second round of ST/OT/PT 5 weeks ago, and has made pretty good progress in OT & PT. But speech has been incredibly difficult. He speaks clearly enough most of the time, but he doesn't communicate very effectively (word choice,  details,  sequence), he has trouble retaining new information,  has slow processing speed, etc. So speech is a HUGE opportunity for him.


The problem is that he doesn't think there's a problem. He's been with his current ST for 5 weeks now without making any progress, let alone meeting the goals she set.  He thinks ""her grading scale is fucked up"" and that his brain will continue to heal itself. So, to him, using the tools and strategies she gives him won't make a difference. She has done exercises to prove to him that they work (memory task score 50-60% on his own vs 70-80% with memory strategies) but he's in total denial. He always has a ""reason"" for why the scores were different. If he doesn't make progress soon insurance will cut him off.

He's 23 and only 3 semesters away from completing his engineering degree,  but if he can't conquer this I don't think he'll be able to.  And it's all about his mindset, and unwillingness to even try to get better. i know that part of it is because of the brain injury,  But it's hard for me to accept that after everything.... ask the progress he's made he would just quit like this. 

Any advice on how to cope with this, to get through to him, to help him,  or even just to share your experience would be greatly appreciated. "
2fcxxd,TBI,"Disclaimer: I have a B.S. in neuroscience and have been heavily rooted in TBI research for over 2 years, I am NOT a PhD or a MD.  
  
I've been doing research on individuals with a TBI (moderate/severe) for the past 2 years and am willing to offer up some advice to people/help for anyone who might want it.  While I'm not a PhD/MD I have a ton of experience dealing with the issues/deficits of those of you who have been effected by this injury.  Feel free to ask any questions you might have, I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.

2f15iw,TBI,"For me, it's been a year and a couple months since I was stopped at a light, hit from behind by a car going 30 miles an hour. At the hospital doctor said ""Cool, you're totally fine, you're just rattled, go home"", even though I felt something had happened to my brain. Couldn't form sentences and was massively de-realized, I felt certain I was dead. I asked if they could make sure my brain was okay and they were really condescending. Also I am transgender and no having control of my body or speech very well and being called my birth name was deeply freaky. I thought about if I had died/if I was dead, no one would remember me as the person I see myself as. Could have been a lot worse, but after months of thinking its my fault I'm not back to ""normal"" yet, a therapist and others said ""those symptoms sound like mild traumatic brain injury"".  Went through being pissed off at the doctor in ER, now I'm just a big shrugger, smiler, awkward person and pusher-througher and I'm trying new things as often as I can. My partner at the time broke up with me, which is reasonable, people gotta move on, but one big thing for me is sometimes I feel doubt over wether I'm making all this up. I've learned some days are better than others, but whenever I am having a hard time a part of me still says ""you are making this up, it's your fault, even if it is real it could be a lot worse so suck it up and don't talk about it"". I have one friend who lives in washington with TBI and I live in CA, hanging out with people I was once close with is really confusing but on the outside I don't think I'm that different to people, so they don't understand.
tl;dr ... how can I tell myself ""ok, this is what's happening, but that doesn't mean you can't improve and change your brain- keep going""? 

I want the self questioning to stop so I can just focus on improving myself but I keep telling myself I'm a dramatic person :/ hah. "
2esm7q,TBI,"People that I thought were close, have became judgmental and condescending. Trying to tell me I'm in the wrong always and my accident made them feel as if they got a free pass to say whatever they want. To them I say:  I can't change the person I am. Just be the best I can be. -sorry-

26qiep,TBI,
26nfss,TBI,"Athletic activities, especially certain sports like American football, are a leading cause of concussions in Boston and throughout the nation. Many athletes will shrug off a head impact, even if they briefly lose consciousness or experience symptoms, such as ringing in the ears. This is a mistake; timely concussion treatment is very important to ensure that the brain has not been damaged. Sometimes athletes feel pressured to return to the field and continue playing despite a possible concussion; they may feel that asking for medical attention is a sign of weakness; they might be embarrassed to admit that they suspect they have been injured. A brain injury is not always immediately apparent and not seeking concussion treatment could lead to problems later on.  


**Sideline Evaluations and Concussion Treatment**  

If an athlete has sustained a blunt impact to the head, neurologists recommend that coaches or on-site medical professionals perform a sideline evaluation to determine the need for concussion treatment. Recommended components of a sideline evaluation include:  

•	A review of symptoms associated with concussion that the athlete is experiencing  
•	A focused neurological exam  
•	A focused orientation exam, which screens for short-term memory recall using questions about the athlete’s last meal, the events immediately before the injury occurred, and other recent memories  
•	A focused orientation exam using questions about the athlete’s name, birthday, place of birth, and other biographical information to screen for long-term memory loss  
•	Assessment of the athlete’s ability to focus on a complex task, such as reciting the months of the year or the alphabet backwards.  


**Signs An Athlete May Need Concussion Treatment**  

There are a number of symptoms immediately recognized by neurologists as indicating a possible head injury and the need for concussion treatment:  

•	Difficulty concentrating  
•	Balance problems  
•	Fatigue or drowsiness  
•	Dizziness or “lightheadedness”  
•	Unusual emotional feelings  
•	Feeling mentally clouded or “foggy”  
•	Headache  
•	Unusual irritability  
•	Memory problems  
•	Nausea and/or vomiting  
•	Unusual nervousness  
•	Numbness or tingling  
•	Unusually heightened sensitivity to light and/or sound  
•	Excessive sleep or difficulty sleeping  
•	Blurry or double vision  
•	Ringing in the ears  

The presence of these symptoms strongly suggests that the athlete has sustained a concussion. Even a mild concussion can have adverse effects that may not be immediately apparent, so concussion treatment is important.  


**How Soon After Concussion Treatment Can An Athlete Return to Play?**  

Athletes who have sustained a mild concussion often feel pressured to return almost immediately to the field, and historically they often returned to play despite it being potentially dangerous to do so. Having recently sustained a concussion has been shown to increase the risk of a second concussion occurring, as well as increasing the risk that the second concussion will be more severe. Nowadays, many Boston clinicians use the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (imPACT) approach, a computerized concussion evaluation system that incorporates a hugely comprehensive database and sophisticated cognitive testing, with which to compare injured athletes to “normative’ individuals in order to assess for signs of a concussion. An imPACT screening takes as little as 20 minutes. Generally, an athlete should not immediately return to the playing field if it has been determined that they need concussion treatment. A period of rest and recovery is important, and the athlete may have to wait a week or two to safely return to play.

26k1ch,TBI,"I just got off of house arrest, and I was able to leave my city for the first time in over two years since my injury, which happened just before HA. I figured out that I am having a difficult time in some social situations, probably because of the HA. I have not been able to get back into things socially without being around new people or groups of people.

I was at a large family gathering - tons of people, half of whom I had never met before because they are not related to me by blood. It was really difficult trying to get to know them and relate. It was awkward. Whenever there was a group of us, which was often, I had a hard time maintaining eye contact, sustaining conversation, keeping focus on the conversation. I was just feeling uncomfortable in general. I didn't think it would be this rough. It makes me wonder if this will ever get better."

And I've had a couple (or five) additional concussions since then too.

Fast forward to present day. I know I go about things differently than most people, but people tend to think I am ignoring them in conversations because I might sit in silence for a bit before answering them. I can't stand it when multiple people start talking at the same time, because I can't follow anyone at that point.

I don't know what I want from this. Back then they just told my parents I fractured my skull and had a concussion. And I guess it still bothers me today.

44oy1q,TBI,"Well, I'll tell you this much - don't do it. 

Since my TBI 2 years I've started learning how to ride again with a disabled sports place and they've been awesome. I've been doing great, I've been starting to get the feel back to the point where I thought I could ride alone.

I know a lot of us since our injuries have visual neglects and vision issues (I have double vision and Balint's Syndrome) so from the get go I should have known to get friends to ride with me when I'm not at the program. 

Well I rode alone today and it was honestly a mess. I rode into some pipe and I even crashed into a skier. I have video of it and it was kinda his fault because he did stop right in front of me, but if my vision was normal again I think I would have seen him and got out of the way faster. Even having a few friends would probably have prevented it. We were both fine (thank god).

I dunno guys, I'm really bummed that riding alone didn't work out as I thought it would, but hopefully this will maybe steer someone else away from riding alone who is similar issues as me. "

43k7zt,TBI,"Today I went to a ""traditional"" therapy center and the person did some sort of head massage....except that it probably wasn't a head massage because he was extremely rough. 

What I could describe it as would be imagine you are sleeping on your hand. The hand is in a vertical position and cupping around the back of your head and bottom of your ear. Then you ""raise your fingers"" and push the back of your head, quite forcefully, and several times (more than 15)

I actually felt like my head was being jostled around and every time my head got ""pushed"" I felt a little nauseous. The pushes were not exceptionally violent, however, since it happned at 1pm, I have been nauseous and have had a headache at the left ""brain"" which was continuously ""roughed"" around. My scalp feels cold and I just feel very disoriented even at 2am, long after the event.

Could I have gotten brain damage from this? It seems unlikely as I read the brain has to been violently accelerated to cause damage, but I can't deny the nausea I am experiencing right now. The back of my head has always been very sensitive to any sort of impact and sometimes even lying on pillows gives me ""too much pressure"" on my head/scalp.

41tfkg,TBI,"**This ended up being pretty long and rambling but I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read it and give me any kind of feedback at all. I think I'm searching for information about TBI's as much as I am someone to talk to.**

Hey everyone, thank you ahead of time for reading. I'm feeling really unsure about a lot of what I'm going to write below. Also I've never really opened up to anyone like this before and it's making me incredibly nervous.

**The Injury:** When I was 9 years old I sustained a pretty major concussion playing soccer. I was knocked over and hit my head very hard on the dirt, my head bounced off the ground and I was immediately kneed in the head by another player, then my head hit the ground again. I immediately went unconscious and didn't wake up for several minutes. I was apparently awake for several minutes before the ambulance arrived but I have very very minimal memory of that time even just days after. I threw up a lot right after I woke up. I was in the hospital for one night only and they sent me home and I was not allowed to play sports for 4 months. I think I missed a week of school also.

Here are some things I've just been thinking about and I don't really know what they mean or if they are relevant at all.

I went from enjoying/tolerating school to absolutely loathing it. This attitude, although less extreme, carried on all the way through the end of high school. I was a high achieving student for my entire schooling career despite my attitude.

I had never gotten car sick before in my life but I became extremely susceptible to it in the months following my concussion and I am still moderately susceptible to this day.


My handwriting barely has improved at all since 4th grade despite working hard at it when teachers kept telling me my handwriting was awful. I often mix up letters or omit them entirely when writing, or even entire words.

I've been battling depression for years, never crippling, but almost always there. I would get mad with myself because I had no reason to be depressed, so I didn't tell anyone how I felt. I can best describe the way I have felt for years as ""trapped in a meaningless struggle"". I've never even thought about taking steps toward suicide or self-harm, but I do question as to why I bother living life because ""I'll never be content with where I am in life"". The reason I fear this is linked to my TBI is because I can't pinpoint a reason for my depression over the years, and it seems to just be an overshadowing constant in my world. 

I opened up to my parents about being depressed about a year ago, but they really were not helpful at all other than being very nice to me for a few weeks. 

I've brought up my fear that my TBI is still affecting me to this day four times to my parents and they have always either immediately dismissed it or told me that it's all in my head. I love my parents to death and truly believe they are great parents, but because of their upbringing and occupations that have very little sympathy for, or understanding of mental illnesses in general.

Final thing. My greatest tool for fighting against depression for the last year has been marijuana. Hands down nothing has even come close to making me feel as free from depression as weed does, not just during the high, but for days after also. I feel more awake. I enjoy the little things in life more, I contemplate new and exciting ideas, I face my fears and do things I had been procrastinating on for months because of anxiety or stress. I'm usually smoke twice per week, and that seems to be enough to remind myself that I can find happiness in the present at any time. 

Thank you for reading! Remember I'm just an 18 year old trying to figure out life like normal, but I think my childhood TBI might be making things a little more difficult. I'd be happy to respond to any questions or comments. "

3xbryx,TBI,"I had a pretty awful fall and shattered the right side of my face. (Nothing too terrible but several breaks and 20 or so fractures.) In my return to school I've found math and English to be especially hard. I lose track of words and numbers easily. I feel as if I know the word or equation but it just doesnt come to mind. I was always a forgetful person so it's hard for me to say if I have any worsening problems with my schedule. 
As for my accident I didn't black out but I lost track of a lot of time right before and after the accident as well as for several weeks after (might have been the pain medication I was on at the time). 
I don't know if I really want to know if it is a TBI it is quite minor and doesn't seem to have a huge effect on my life although I have had to switch majors because I can't handle the math anymore. Is it worth having a diagnosis either direction?

I have not worked since my injury but I am looking to get back to work. I have been living like a hermit for the last four years and I can’t stand it anymore lol. 

I’m going to have to push myself a bit to get back to work and I know my symptoms are going to increase and I’m having trouble wrapping my head around that. Also I’m worried about doing too much and having a set back.

I will be working with an employment agency that specializes in helping people with disabilities return to work. And if they can’t find something that suits me or is compatible with my restrictions I have some volunteer opportunities. But I would really prefer to work than volunteer.  

My question is: To those of you that have made it back to work; what are you still dealing with, pushing through and tolerating in order to work or study? 

If you're cool with disclosing your occupation or major that would be helpful (if not no problem). "

3o290w,TBI,"Hello! This is my first time posting on this sub and I had a question. 

When I was 15 I suffered from a TBI and Second Impact Syndrome. I couldn't leave my bed for about 6 months, and ended up having a dull headache ( 3/10 ) for about 2 years. 

Finally my neuro found the perfect combination to break the constant headaches and I now only get severe migraines 2-3 times a month. I am no longer on preventative medicine, and just emergency medicine. 

Recently I have noticed my memory becoming pretty awful. I am only 20 years old but have to leave notes for basic things. I left my iron plugged in today from 7AM until I realized it was still on at 10 PM. I've been forgetting to eat until I see food, forgetting about classes I attend every week at the same time, and incredibly minor things like replying to texts. I am getting a regular amount of sleep, and drinking water. I just am wondering if my senior-citizen level memory can be blamed on my prior TBI or if it probably something else. 

I also moved to a new city full time for college and am seeing a new neuro next month. Is this something I should bring up or will he think I'm crazy?

320hg7,TBI,"There are 4 chemicals that your brain produces that are often referred to as your ""happy chemicals.""  Dopamine is the good feeling you get when you approach a reward. Serotonin is the good feeling of getting respect. Oxytocin is the feeling of trust, and endorphin is the euphoria that masks physical pain. 

I battle with depression a lot.  I notice that when I am training for a race (1/2 marathon, marathon or triathlon) and I know that I have a specific goal which is always just to make it to the finish line, my depression is gone.  When I am in between races and I stop training, the depression returns.  I have been reading about the happy chemicals and I know exercise increases them, especially endurance exercise so that is what I do.  I am by no means the fastest or the best, as a matter of fact, I am classified as a disabled or physically challenged athlete bc of all of my injuries but just getting out there and trying is all it takes to help me be happy.  I call it my magic pill. 

I do believe we all have a magic pill and for you it may not be endurance sports or exercise, but maybe you are a musician, or artist, or writer, or whatever it is that you truly enjoy, that is your magic pill.  That will help produce your happy chemicals and when you are happy, you sleep better, you feel better and I just think the brain functions better.  I battled with alcohol abuse and overeating for 15 years before I was able to find my magic pill. "

30sewj,TBI,"Hi everyone. I'm a post 1 1/2 yr mild TBI survivor. Despite the information I've been told about from medical professionals and what I've read online, I still feel as if my knowledge of TBI is relatively limited. I feel as if I lack so many mental functions that are important/necessary for school and studying in general. Is it possible for an injury to affect you both cognitively and socially? What exactly is normal?  Are there any limitations to what I can achieve? Has anyone else undergone a complete change of mindset?  I've become quieter now, more so than before. Not saying it's a bad thing but its a big change. If I want to talk, the words don't exactly form in my head so I just stay silent. Are there chances of getting back the pre- injury self back? Also somebody needs to say this to me upfront cus noone's really telling me what I should/have to do at home cus i feel as if my family is kinda unaware of what I need to do to even pass or maintain/increase my intelligence or mental abilities.  To what extent can I go to with my studies? Is coffee an ok choice for study sessions? Why do people say I should avoid it? Would it be alright for my health if I pull an all-nighter to study for my exams? What can I do to improve my focus? Anyone else have anger issues as well and an inability to control emotions, i.e very strong ones. Its like there're no brakes when I get mad but its mostly with my immediate family, not outsiders. Though it HAS gotten tons better, its still not under my control yet. Another thing, Its not like I don't work at it but my results(academics) don't even show a hint of the work I put in. Does it get better or is there a limit to how much the brain can repair itself? What does shearing of the neurons mean? Are Contusions like bruising in the nervous tissue in the brain? I would've bombarded a doctor for these answers but apparently like my social life, my mind completely blanks out in the moment. Honestly saying, the medical reports are so wrong. The amnesia wiped out all of 2013 and 2014 for me. I cant even remember what I had for breakfast if I don't focus. Likewise, studies are another mountain I muster up the energy to attempt the climb but eventually my attempts fall face first back down to where I started from...splat! :( I want to work xtremely hard especially since I'm in my senior years and not have regrets but will that really be possible anymore? Should I even have dreams and goals? Im not even afraid of failing and that scares me cus I have to do something with my life and I wanna graduate high school while I'm still a teenager. To whoever who's reading this and decides to reply, thank you an infinity times. I know this post is extremely long and most ppl wud be like TL; DR but then again, I don't really open up to ppl cus a)Im an extreme introvert and b) not many people in this part of the world have even heard of BI's except the neurology/psychiatry/psychology/neuroscience/emergency departments.

2w9a20,TBI,"First off, I'm very sorry if this is the wrong place for this post. My research suggested that a concussion is a mild form of a TBI but my concussion was fairly mild compared to many of the posts on this subreddit and I can't find a non abandoned version of /r/concussions.

I've been dealing with PCS for about 2 months on a mild concussion. I Hit my head on the ground after falling. The concussion was very light: no blackout, a little dizziness and then onset of some light headaches after about 8-12 hours.  I didn't even realize I had concussion until the headaches.

About two weeks ago my doctor cleared me for normal life (sans high risk activities that could give me another concussion). The thing is, I still get mild pains in my head from time to time (he knows), the occasional ear ringing (very rare) and lightheaded/dizziness (I didn't tell my doctor because I thought I was over both those latter two). They're fairly rare, I often go full days without any symptoms, get a headache or head rush for a few seconds and then go symptom free again.

I've been doing exercise too and other than extended periods of high impact exercises (running) I feel pretty darn good albeit sometimes light headed.

I also feel as though my doctor may not have understood me when I told him about my occasional headaches. He told me mild neurological pain was no big deal at this stage.

Has anyone been told that mild, intermittent head aches (in absence of other symptoms) was ""nothing to worry about""?

edit: I should add that through this whole situation I've only had a single headache that was so bad that it was distracting. It came after working on my computer all day about 3 weeks in. I took it a little bit easier after that."
2w3upg,TBI,"Before my TBI, I played games on this website called Kongregate or something. I'd play 2 games. (1) It was called Diner Dash or something. (2) Papa Burgeria.

They were games that I liked and I used to play to just burn some time. 

Anyway, I played one of them last night and I was in tears. I got so overwhelmed by everything. I felt legitimately stressed out. Like 'cramming for finals' stressed out. Almost in tears. 

These stupid time waster games that I used to have a lot of fun playing just make me overwhelmed now. 

Has anyone had similar feelings while trying to do some ""stress relievers"" that in the end left you more stressed out? "

2tvac3,TBI,"I had a pretty bad head injury a year ago. 

In OT my records say that I was dominantly right handed... but I use my left hand for everything now. From brushing my teeth to learning how to write again - I've been using my left hand. 

I still am learning but it's almost like I totally forget about everything on my right side now. 

My OT talks about left and right side neglect. 

Anyone else go through this?

2qdjr1,TBI,"Hi all

I hope everybody's having a Merry Christmas.

My healthcare situation is so messed up. I can only see the neurologist every couple months, and have no way to contact him or his office directly because he goes back and forth between several offices.

My Primary Care Doctors won't really ""rule"" on anything, they all defer to him (which is what they should do, really).

But anyway problem is this: it's been 8 months since I suffered a TBI. I'm getting severe headaches still, and my eye is twitching, and I'm losing ""focus"" and ""concentration"" really easily. These are things which have waxed and waned in the past few months but I feel like they're increasing lately.

Nobody on my care team (including the neurologist but also nurses, occupational therapist and psychologist) thinks these are significant, and tell me basically ""this is a normal part of a brain injury recovery--you may have these problems for the rest of your life.""

Something in me protests. I'm still suffering and I feel like something re: my TBI *MIGHT* be getting worse. However, I've been told that it can't get worse unless I hit my head again.

Is this fully, totally, 100% accurate? If I'm being paranoid, I want to know, but the pace at which in-person conversations with my treatment team moves means I can't follow along. I have aphasia, but I can write/read better, since I do that at my own processing speed."

2pmh5q,TBI,"So, when I was still in the rehab hospitable there was a group were they talked about TBI issues with people who have had one. And one was about booze. The doctor said it is like 4 times as effective post-tbi. Like one drink is 4 drinks. All the doctors told me to wait a year or risk seizures. I've kinda lost interest but since various gatherings are approaching and it has been a year for those of you who have had a TBI and also had a drink, how did it affect you? Was one beer like 4? "
2ous3z,TBI,"Hello,

I'm 17 and currently suffering from Post Concussion Syndrome, which was caused by having a concussion 10 days after my original one (didn't lose conciousness or had nausea in any one of them, but still got PCS). My PCS is mainly characterized by constant confusion and daze.

Anyway, that would be a lot of details to tell, and I'm anxious about something right now.

About an hour ago, I finished eating my popcorn and then I stupidly decided to chew the unpopped kernels (the seeds that didn't pop). I chewed a few of them, and I broke them with my teeth.

When I broke them with my teeth I felt my head shaking aggressively, similar to the original concussion I got. I know it's only POPCORN SEEDS, but still, biting hard on them and having them suddenly break between my teeth caused my head to shake aggressively and I believe my brain bounced against my skull because of that sudden movement. When the seeds broke I felt the strong shaking of my head.

A few minutes after this happened I began to experience strong nausea, blurry vision, increased confusion and intense tiredness. It's all gone right now, 1 hour later, but I'm still afraid I've caused myself another concussion. I know it might sound ridiculous to some of you, but I swear it's true. I'm anxious about it right know, and I hoped I didn't mess things up by giving myself another concussion (as you know, every concussion after the first one increases the risk for permanent brain damage).

So do you think I have caused myself another concussion by biting hard and breaking the seeds with my teeth? Is it possible?

Please reply and tell me what you think, it would be extremely helpful.

Thanks,

2ht465,TBI,"Anybody here have experience or knowledge of Concerta (methylphenidate ER) being used to treat the cognitive symptoms of TBI after the physical healing has taken place? I've heard that it's an uncommon but not unheard of use.

I am not asking for personal medical advice, just asking to get a feel of the situation from other people who've experienced it or their loved ones and to know what to expect when I accompany a loved one to the doctor.

I've done some searches and heard a few instances of this, and I'm wondering how it works--is the mechanism of action the same? Is it a lifelong/permanent situation or do people eventually go off the medication? I know it's a mild stimulant, but it's still a stimulant (and a distant cousin to cocaine).

Anything else that's relevant to know?"
2fgqdq,TBI,"I posted this in the PTSD sub and then just found this sub, was hoping to get some more helpful advice from you guys. I will cut and paste my entries and reply to the one person who responded since it gives more info than my original post.  Thank you in advance!

**Initial Post**
 
I am madly in love with, and plan on marrying this man, but I am having a very hard time treating him abnormal. What I mean is, I find it very hard to not treat him like he is doesn't have a mental disorder or that he doesn't suffer PTSD or is missing part of his brain. He has a tumor removed years back, and is still cancer free. It was in his right frontal lobe. He is functional, more emotionally and mentally in-tune than most people I know and is extraordinarily smart. Which leads me to forget that I am still not dealing with someone ""normal."" I only use the word normal because that is how he puts it, he always tells me I forget that he is not dealing with a full deck and needs my help, but I feel like I am doing way more damage than good. It's only when we argue, he rages. And when I say rages, he RAGES. Last night was a huge blow up, which is never ultimately about the initial issue but turns into something bigger when he starts getting mean, and physical w himself. Last night was the worst, I stood there and watched him punch himself in the face 3 times, saying he wishes it was me he was punching. He is one of the sweetest, kindest, loving, trusting, loyal people I have ever met, but he has this dark side and I am afraid I am not helping him manage it. I get overwhelmed in my own emotions and it is very hard for me to let him walk away, or for me to stop trying to talk to him, because in the moment emotions are what they are, not logical. I get confused with the fact that for the most part he manages like a normal, receptive person. But when that switch flips it's hard for me to go ""ok, wait, remember..."" and suck it up. I need to be able to handle this. I need to be able to help him. He depends on me to not ""push"" the envelope with him. But I am so afraid I am doing the complete opposite of that.

I'm just wondering if there is anyone else out there who is dealing with this, in my position or the other side.

He goes to therapy, and we have gone together, and we are on the right track of trying to find peace in those moments but it isn't working because either I am being selfish or I think he is being selfish. I'm afraid the stress is going to bring the cancer back, or he is going to harm himself physically, and he is afraid he is going to harm me physically, etc. It is a shitshow.

Sorry if this was ranty, or all over, any gaps that need to be filled for better understanding please ask and I will answer. I appreciate any help, I am trying to understand this disease the most I can and it seems hands on isn't working as well as I thought it may.

Edit to include, he is constantly calling himself a monster and despises what he turns into when he is mad.

**My response to the poster:**

I've thought about all these things. Moreso now than before because now I know what I'm dealing with more than I did. He was abused and molested as a child, he's had cancer that took part of his brain and changed him as a person. He has explosive episodes due to the brain issues. Everyone has given up on him over time. He really has no friends anymore. I remember him in high school (we're in our late 30's) being surrounded by people. Not anymore. On one hand I feel my loyalty won't let me leave because I see past all of that and when he doesn't flip out (which really doesn't happen unless he's triggered (which I'm sure you know, is a dice roll), or we argue and it gets to be too much for him. I feel like if I can walk away like he needs me to, for just a few minutes for him to calm down it would suppress a lot of explosions. But some times it doesn't and it's so easy for him to say ""it's my brain u know I have issues I can't control this..."" Which then does what for me? I have to stifle my emotions and feel for him over me. Its hard. I handle all our finances and responsibilities which at first I didn't mind because I've been doing it my whole life but now on top of that the behavior is getting worse at times and it makes the little things harder. As for having kids, I never really wanted them and we don't even know if he can have them w all the radiation he received. I do think about how nice a little family would be but then I immediately think ""i can't have kids w this man"" because god knows what that child would have to go through. His mother kept him in a house where she knew her husband (his step father) was beating him and didn't leave (he calls her an angel which drives me nuts because she kept him in that house and didn't protect him from shit, she's to blame too), and my kids would be dealing w the same minus the beatings. It would be daddy acting like an animal. It would be easier for me to leave if he wasn't so aware and so upset over what he knows he is. If he was ignorant and didn't wish he got this way I'd be able to easily say ""good luck bye."" I can never have a moment, if I'm mad at something or upset it most of the time turns into his shit. It doesn't stay on me. We end up w him getting heightened and needing an ""adult time out"" and it's not fair to me. Again he's aware of this and feels bad.

Is your husband on meds? They have him on depicote for seizures which he doesn't get but it's a mood stabilizer too. Which doesn't help and makes him confused at times, w memories or storylines etc. Last night we prefer pizza and I told him 3 times ""get 11 in change"" and I heard him stuttering at the door and ends up giving a 6buck tip instead of 3. I'm like REALLY even when I prepare you this happens. It's so stressfull.

On the other side of not leaving, I am a mess myself. I come with huge trust and daddy issues that I've worked on long before we started dating but he can tolerate it. He can handle my questions, or crazybrain at times. He's very understanding and patient with me. So, it's a trade off in a way because god knows I have never had a man be able to conform for or to me as he does, and I am so appreciative for that. It's like we are 2 kinds of crazies living together.

I don't know. And I keep trying to quit smoking and I'll be fine for days then something happens, I get stressed, and smoke. We were trying to avoid meds because we're afraid it would change him in other ways. Make him a zombie etc. He does smoke pot, which helps keep him calm down because when he runs out, which I try to not let happen because he's like a speed racer and all over the place w/o it, and it also helps seizures, etc you know I'm sure it's all over the news medicinally lately.

I've just never gotten SO much love and loyalty from one person in my life, he lacks in one area but makes it up in others, same as us all I assume. So leaving him at this point isn't an option but trust me, I am not blind to the reality and I constantly ask myself if I can handle this forever. I sometimes don't even know if there is a forever because while he is a survivor of his type of cancer, odds are against him. The survival rate after 5yrs is in the 30 percentile. He's making 5yrs in January and just had a clean mri last month so he is definitely beating the odds. So ultimately I look forward to the man I love either dying from this cancer if it does come back, having triggers and raging occasionally for the rest of my life, or leaving him. But leaving him just won't happen, I know how I am and I'm a stubborn idiot, all 3 of those scenarios results in heartbreak. And the latter of them wouldn't sit well on my conscience. "
2blw3o,TBI,"So I flew for the first time since my coma, yesterday, and it was a little intense. Everything was pretty much fine until we began to ascend. Triggered an instant headache, then a crying toddler turned that into a full blown migraine. Ended up doubling up on my daily dosage, just on the flight alone. I even had to resort to my: ""Break glass in case of emergency"" meds.      "
2bhxet,TBI,"Huh, who knew how therapeutic writing can be. Growing up, I always thought I hated writing too. Something I wrote out touching on some pretty real stuff I've experienced with life. Haha it's a pretty big wall of text, read it if you've got the time, I may be a bit biased but I feel like it's some pretty decent material.

People are affected by life in different and unique ways. There's always a reason why behind every action. It might not be obvious but there's always a reason. That doesn't mean every action should be condoned or is even admissible, it's just important to realize that there usually is a bigger picture Regardless of our differences, we're all human. We all have our own lives to live. Life definitely gets hard. It can feel almost impossible at times but I don't know, for whatever reason, it seems to have an interesting way of working itself out. With the way things turn out, it's hard not to believe everything that happens, happens for a reason. I don't know though, with just how unfair this world is it makes something like that hard to believe. Third-world countries do exist, there are human beings in this world who literally starve to death, children are born with life-crippling diseases in countries where they aren't able to receive the medical care they need. Murder happens, the child sex industry exists, it's hard to look at things like that and believe in a greater plan. Acceptance of life's mysteries can be an extremely liberating way to live life. 

With my brain injury, I never thought I could be happy again. Depression's scary and it sucks. A TBI sort of just makes life 'different.' It's crazy to see how differently a TBI can affect people. My case has been…for lack of a way to put it into reason, pretty unexplainable. I've had an amazing recovery and I'm still seeing improvement. Honestly, life feels pretty surreal. There's no reason I should still be alive. I was ejected from a car that flipped on the interstate and I was in a coma for about 4 weeks. I was life-flighted to Vanderbilt where I was able to receive the care I'd need to survive. And then some of the complications I faced while I was in the trauma unit…it's all so very surreal. Especially the fact that I was able to come out of this without any debt shows just how unfair this life can be. I still have my ups and downs and there are things I still struggle with because of it, stuff I'll just have to learn to manage I guess, but in general, I'm happy.Changes are scary and can really mess with whatever plans you had but life goes on. The world keeps spinning. At the end of the day, the most you can really do for others is to try to be the best 'you' that you can be. Trying to compare your life to somebody else's does you no good. It does nothing to make your life a better experience. There's always somebody doing better and always somebody doing worse. My TBI's given me a new perspective on life and given me reason to appreciate it in a much different way. 

Life is definitely weird and confusing. Hindsight makes it possible to say that everything that happened is what was supposed to happen. Things like that could contribute to why people want to believe in supernatural power. All I can say in regards to that is, ""I don't know."" Some things seem to have happened so perfectly, you can't help but wonder if there was a bigger plan or something. But the thing about hindsight is, we'd feel the same way about things that happened in the past even if something different, maybe something even better, had happened. What's awesome about knowing that is knowing that things can get better. Persevere. It can get better. 

By definition, having faith is believing something without evidence. Life is too unfair and there's a bit too much chaos in this world for me to be able to believe in the existence of a fully-cognizant, all-loving, supernatural being. Pascal's wager should be dismissed because there are literally hundreds if not thousands of religions and gods that people choose to put their faith in. No one has the knowledge needed to absolutely determine what's right or wrong. Choosing the right one's sort of like playing the lottery. If a superpower directly told me to follow it, of course I'd do it. Until that happens, it's simply faith. I can't have 'faith.' Call me weak, whatever, I'm just willing to admit that I don't know.Just be a good person. Good things will follow. It's pretty amazing what having genuine kindness and empathy can do for you. It's fun to see how contagious it is. We shouldn't think differently of people for having or not having faith. Don't be arrogant. Nothing good comes from being arrogant. That goes for anybody. Arrogance stems from personal insecurities. Seemingly terrible people are always insecure about something. 

Ignorance, more specifically the lack of empathy, is really what makes people do the awful things they do. Wherever you look, you can always find good and bad. Personal beliefs are what give some people the strength to get through this life. But don't get faith and knowledge mixed up. Don't get carried away with it, too many choose to take things too far. A problem with religion is that instead of looking at it as ""This is what I believe,"" many choose to think ""I'm right and you're wrong."" Be humble, with whatever you do or don't believe. I do know that everyone has the desire to be loved. Good or bad doesn't just come down to how well one can follow a set of rules. Life is more than just black and white. It's not that simple. Everyone's got a human side to them. Empathy, having thought for someone else's thoughts and emotions, is where goodness comes from. Don't get caught up in superficial labels. There are things that we may never understand. It can be extremely liberating finding peace with that. We don't have to live this one life we get in fear. 'Forever' is a wishful desire. If there is a forever where our eternal fate is dependent entirely on faith in the words of men or the manipulation of observable data, so be it. That's a risk I'll take, blind faith is something I'm simply unable to have. This one life is all that we get. That's what I believe. Cherish it. Admitting ignorance doesn't come easy. Don't get complacent. Remain curious. 

Everyone is human. We all go through this life trying to figure it out as best as we can with what we know. We all have our own demons to battle. Having true empathy can make life a much more beautiful experience. If you want to believe in something that can truly make you be better, believe in karma. I really do think being good can make our existence a much more fulfilling one. Do your part to make this world a better place. Have love for people. Don't be legalistic and judgmental. It won't do anything for you. Be forgiving, of others and of yourself. Be a good person. Be genuinely kind. Be able to have love for yourself. There's a lot in life that's completely out of our control but realize that our actions do have consequences. You can take responsibility for most of what happens to you. Take responsibility for the way you choose to live your life. Life is unfair but happiness is relative. Throughout all spectrums of life, there are happy people. Happiness is a choice. Live and let live."

28iius,TBI,"Primary head injury can be catastrophic, but [the effects of repetitive head injuries must also be considered](http://www.brainline.org/content/2008/08/repetitive-head-injury-syndrome_pageall.html). The effect of multiple head injuries over time remains significant and can result in long-term neurologic and functional deficits, and in many cases, death.

Second Impact Syndrome (SIS) describes the situation in which an individual sustains a second head injury before the symptoms from the first head injury have resolved. The second impact is more likely to cause brain swelling and widespread damage. SIS, though rare, causes permanent damage. The mortality rate for SIS approaches 50%, and morbidity (disability) is almost 100%. Due to the very small number of recorded cases of SIS, there is doubt about whether it is a valid diagnosis. However, the syndrome is recognized by physicians.

Even if the effects of the initial injury have already resolved, the effect of multiple concussions over time remains significant and can result in long-term damage. Multiple brain insults can still be termed repetitive head injury syndrome, but they do not fit the classification of SIS because there are no lingering symptoms of the first injury. True SIS would most likely have a more devastating outcome. 

Multiple blows, even minor blows, over a period of time could lead to other problems. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, commonly known as CTE, is frequently seen in retired athletes who participated in sports which cause repetitive blows to the head. Overall, the outcome of multiple head injuries over a prolonged period has not been well studied and is not well understood.

The bottom line here is that those who suffer any form of concussion are more susceptible to a second concussion, and the second concussion will likely be worse. If you have suffered a blow to the head, it is vital that you take extra precautions in order to avoid another head injury.

269efr,TBI,"Brain injury is unpredictable in its consequences. Brain injury affects who we are, the way we think, act, and feel. It can change everything about us in a matter of seconds. The most important things to remember: 

* A person with a brain injury is a person first.

* No two brain injuries are exactly the same.

* The effects of a brain injury are complex and vary greatly from person to person.

* The effects of a brain injury depend on such factors as cause, location, and severity.

**Tips to Aid Recovery:**

* If you suspect a head injury, first go to a physician for an exam.

* Get lots of rest. Don’t rush back to daily activities such as work or school.

* Avoid doing anything that could cause another blow or jolt to the head.

* Ask your doctor when it’s safe to drive a car, ride a bike, or use heavy equipment because your ability to react may be slower after a brain injury.

* Take only the medications your doctor has approved, and don’t drink alcohol until your doctor says it’s OK.

* Write things down if you have a hard time remembering.

It's almost like I can feel where the bruise is. For reference my CT scan looked fine.

35nahm,TBI,
35lm0t,TBI,"So I had a really old TBI that I just discovered. Is my GP right in that they can't do anything for me? I sorta just want to get evaluated to see what is lingering from the TBI and what I should be doing life-style wise to accommodate it. I'm seeing a therapist, but y'know, when all you have is a hammer... (I'm saying they don't see TBI patients a lot.)

I went and got my old hospital records for my own sake, and found on the charts ""mTBI"" with an x where I now have a dent on my forehead: upper right front. The date of admittance was June 2003.

Here are the symptoms I think are (potentially) related to the TBI:

Shitty handwriting. My handwriting was kinda crappy before I had the TBI, but now it's like it just never got better. I'm in college now, but my Community College allowed teachers to say no to my computer. However when talking to special services, when I brought up the TBI, the four-year brought up handwriting, offered ""assistive technology"" and now teachers can't ban my laptop.

I have some language problems. I mix up metaphors a lot. You know how some metaphors mean basically the same thing? I'll start one and end with the other. I lose words a lot, more frequently than others, from what I can tell. It's worst verbally, better conversationally when I'm writing, and when I'm writing professionally it vanishes. I have a stutter that basically comes and goes as it pleases. (I can't figure out what triggers it, and it's a moderate stutter, enough to bother me, enough that people notice and question me on it.) 

Memory is questionable. Names I struggle with, but from what I can tell, no worse than anyone else. I don't need to take notes in classes. Unless its on names or dates of important figures. I can't remember dates or events in my own life. Conversations I had. I tell the same stories over and over again. (People put up with it, or just tell me ""you've told me this one,"" and I stop and move on.) I can't remember homework due dates. Growing up, if the lunch lady would tell me ""you need lunch money"" we'd usually need three or four goes at it before I'd actually successfully remember and get the message home. (The ones at middle school worked well with me at this, and would still let me eat food on ""credit"" once they figured out that I was just really ""absent-minded"" but the high school ones told me ""you are almost an adult, you should be able to figure this out."")

For this I have an online calendar. It doesn't send me reminders, but I have it always open in a tab, and I check it multiple times a day. It has a task list too, and it's shared with a few other people.

Temporally is where I struggle a lot. I can't tell how much time has passed in the long term. A few hours I can do, but if you were to ask me how long I have been dating my girlfriend, before last night when I went and found a record of when she asked me out, I wouldn't be able to do it. (And I'd still have to look it up on my calendar.) Basically, I was always late for everything, (it's less so now due to adaptation: I have a watch, I over-estimate travel times, and so on, so I'm late for 20% of things as compared to 90% of things). 

I do have two mental disorders: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (with regular panic attacks, but apparently panic disorder no longer can be diagnosed if the panic attacks can be linked to another anxiety disorder), and Dysthymia (long-term, milder depression) with episodes of Major Depressive Disorder. 

I know GAD came before the accident, but depression could have come after. 

So, I know that's an info dump, but should I push my GP to refer me to a neurologist for an eval? Is it truly too late? Any life adjustments you guys suggest? "
338qym,TBI,"I sustained a concussion and frontal lobe contusion about 6 months ago and have recently began to feel better, though still not 100%.  Recently, a friend playfully slapped my cheek in jest, and I've felt off since then.  I wholly realize that this could just be anxiety, since I'm hypersensitive about protecting my head post-injury.

31ctim,TBI,"Is there any sort of treatment for people with tbi? I was just diagnosed last summer, and my last brain injury was over ten years ago. I have anxiety, depression, memory problems, anger issues, instantly overwhelmed by any feeling of stress, and I haven't been able to work for long periods of time, because of a mix of these. It's a financial strain, not to mention the strain on my relationships and general well being. I'm often suicidal, and I just want to give up. It's been so long and nothing seems to get better. The only help I get is a trauma therapist appointment every three weeks, where we basically just talk for an hour. Is there anything out there? I'd get electro shock therapy, you can cut the damaged area out, shoot electro magnets at my brain, anything, are these even options - how do I sign up?  I just want to get back to work, and function in society."

Now, my question is, would you guys be worried about bashing you head again? I've been told that I ""can't afford"" to hit my head again. I'm sure most of us have been told that. 

I've been bi-skiing and I convinved them to let me try a box (it's like a really thick rail in the terrain park... before my TBI I was a snowboarder that rode park and did crazy shit), well the guy who is behind me (the tetherer, if anyone is familiar with bi-skiing) bailed out and I ended up bashing face first into the snow. With a helmet of course.

I'm pretty sure I did something to my nose. My face is all bruised up. I have a pounding headache. I don't think I sustatined a bad TBI but maybe a concussion at the most. 

Should I have gone to the ER? I see my neuro this week anyway, so I figured whatever. I didn't want to wait like 4 hours in the ER in another state that's 6 hours away from home. 

edit: Went to ER, thank god I only got let off with a concussion. I figured that was all it was anyway, still no better.  Always wear a helmet you guys."

2uh034,TBI,"10 months post TBI. I take Concerta every day at 8:30 for attention and energy.

Walk to work from 8:30-8:55.

Work 9-12.

Lunch 12-1. I can't stay in the building while on lunch, so I walk for 15 minutes to a deli then 15 minutes back and eat on the way.

Around 2:00 every day the same symptoms happen:

Sudden light-headedness, dizziness, feelings of imminent fainting (although I don't usually faint), being warm, not fully present, exhausted.

I become very sleepy and yawn a lot. By 3:00-4:00-5:00 I'm as good as dead. I just  can't function. I go home at 5:00, walk until 5:45 (it takes longer to walk back because I'm always weaker/tireder but also because of increased traffic), then go to sleep between 7-10.

Even on days when I don't work (like today) the same thing happens. 

And if I don't take the meds at all, a lot of time I literally can't get out of bed (no joke).

My doctor told me that the Concerta should last until 6-7 pm, but it just flat out doesn't and I'm already on the maximum dose. He insists that it does. I don't know how to navigate this.

I don't *want* more stimulants and I told him that. I want to know why I routinely experience this when I ""shouldn't"" be.."

My dad has had a TBI for about 15 years and has taken Ritalin the whole time. Recently, he had a change in insurance and has to see a different doctor. This new doctor flat out called my dad a drug addict (he also takes a low dose of valuum very rarely. He could hardly go through a 60 day bottle in 6 months).

He's  been off the Ritalin for a month now and I can see the change. He wont go play pool with me anymore, sleeps a ton, is cranky and sometimes irrational. 

Im just sick of doctors and people treating him like he's just an addict. Some people are even so ignorant they immediatly assume he is drunk, which he never is. He has a paralyzed vocal chord, so his voice is a little weird. His movements and thoughts are slow. But he's still a very smart accountant.

2t1y7g,TBI,"I was exposed to what is called acute carbon monoxide poisoning.  A high dose in a short period.  I became dizzy and confused and when I realized what was going on I turned off the source and got to fresh air.  After an hour I felt clear again.  I was thinking it wasn't a big deal and I didn't do anything about it.

48 hours later I went straight to the emergency room after work.  I was having a panic attack with an elevated heart rate, confusion, dizziness and extreme nausea.  The ER doctor blamed it on an inner ear infection and subscribed Antivert to treat vertigo.  He totally disregarded my concerns about the carbon monoxide poisoning.  

The Antivert was no help to me and I was still having issues with a general foggy feeling, nausea, fatigue and confusion.  I did research and found that the carbon monoxide I was exposed to could have effected my brain.  I began taking a few tabs of Omega-3 a day and also tried something called (BSF) BioSuperFuel that is supposed to support brain functions.  

I saw my family docotor and he still claimed it was an inner ear thing and he prescribed Xanax.  I only took 1 Xanax for the first couple of days and then quit.

After 2 more weeks I started to feel clearer.  But then within the last couple of days my symptoms have returned again.  Foggy feeling, nausea, fatigue and confusion.  I'm using the Xanax again so that I can stomach food and I am increasing my omega-3s to see if it helps.

Am I right in assuming I have some minor brain damage?
Is there any chance of me snapping out of what's going on."
2qia2v,TBI,"4 weeks ago I was assaulted, loss consciousness from a blow to the head, I was out for a few minutes. ER CT scan was clear, received stitches on my cheek/lip and 2 Primary care physicians appointments later.

I read here that people take years / lifetime to get over these issues. Primary care hasn't seemed concerned at all... 

Since I was knocked out the headaches have lessened, Tylenol 2x325mg relieves the headaches and I can sleep without interruption. I'm back in therapy with a psychologist.

Do you take an SSRI for depression? Which one? Does anyone have any research I could read regarding SSRIs lowering the seizure threshold? It seems half the websites I read say they lower the threshold, and half say it has no impact. I'd love some input. Thanks!"

3zdl1x,TBI,"I was out with my friends 3 nights ago and I hit my head few times in the club. I had a moderate amount of alcohol, I usually drink a lot and really often so I can tell the amount was not enough to kick me out. As I was drinking, I couldn't drive and I'm around 20 minutes on foot from the place where we were but I decided to take the taxi. Almost the same moment I got in, I have hard time recalling what happened. I remember I got out of the taxi at bus station which is 50 meters from the building I live in but I simply don't remember how I got home, I remember I fell few times and I had to get up before I entered the building. Next thing I remember is being naked on the floor laying on my belly and clumping my vomit with one of my hands and my father was behind me, looking at me and asking ""What are you doing?"" and I'd told him to go to bed. Next day I woke up with strong headache. I had flasbacks of what happened and I knew something was not right. I didn't leave my room that day. Next day I went to my parents and talked some gibberish apparently and I asked them for something cold to put on my head. They were expecting that I got drunk so hard and did all of that my father saw, but my mother immediately told me to go to bed because I was slowed down and talked kind of strange. I couldn't say if those were true, everything was normal. She told me I was yelling from the bathroom for someone to come and help me. As I've said earlier, I do drink a lot (I'm turning 20 in a month and I know that's not something to be proud of) and I've never called for help no matter what mess I made. I would be sometimes knocked out after drinking and half an hour later, I'd help someone who got drunk as well, I could really manage myself while being drunk. That was the strangest thing to me, that never happens. Apparently I hit my head quite a few times when I came to the apartment. 3rd night is passing (7am at the moment) and I'm not feeling good with the idea of falling asleep. I'm seeing a doctor in few hours and I'm really wondering what he will tell me, I really hope I'll get told to go home and rest. I might have hit my head quite a number of times through my life. I do parkour/freerunning and skydiving so my brain had some hits here and there. I'm feeling well emotionally and I have a feeling my skills/inteligence didn't get damaged simply because I am in a state to write English but it's not my first language (I'm from Croatia, Europe) and I helped my friend with his programming assignment yesterday. My mother said my body language and way of speech is different, but I feel kind of fine with all that. I am experiencing quite a headache and neck pain, but mentally I believe I'm fine. What can I expect from the doctor and what is the worst case? I'd really like to be prepared to any level for that as this is my first time in hospital in 8 years and last time I was there was because of a broken finger. Thank you in advance."

33dbpf,TBI,"Over the years I have had at least 11 concussions. I am 52, was always active, involved with sports and the outdoors and I had an abusive husband for a number of years which accounted for a few of them. I knew the drill, what to watch for, what to do. This last December I had an accident on the ice. I was moving around my suburban too quickly, clearing ice off the windshields and with the momentum, I ended up ramming into the tree at an angle. I hit the upper back of my head, but also hit the left side on the ice covered roots. The trunk jammed my head to the left. I think I was out for a short bit. 

When I opened my eyes and realized I was on the ground, the first thing I did was to check my previous shoulder injuries to make sure they werent re-injured. Everything seemed to work so I got up, and headed inside feeling banged up. Having had concussions before I did not feel the need to go to a doctor and had no medical insurance. I have never had a head injury like this one before. I could barely speak, couldnt handle light or any noise, left side severely weakened or wouldnt work, nauseated, couldnt do anything I normally did, no sense of smell or taste, no memory, roaring in my head, no linear time, couldnt write or spell. For a couple weeks cerebral spinal fluid was leaking from my left nostril (previous surgery there for spinal meningitis- path of least resistance). I didnt realize that was what it was at the time.

The giant knot behind my left ear was still there a month later. At that point I realized this was not just a simple concussion that would go away within a couple weeks. Being an independent researcher, I began looking into what was going on with my head and what to do about it. A friends wife had a major injury and suggested a book on TBI. With the new search terms I could better research, especially what is dealing with the combat vets. Piece by piece I found academic papers on certain nutrients the brain needs to heal and added those to my daily regime. Each time I added a new component, about 3-4 days later I would see an improvement. The Magtein (MIT created magnesium combination) was awesome.

I normally run about 4-5 train tracks of thought in my head at any point in time. I am very balanced mentally, have some activities that are very left brain and some that are very right brain, I swing both ways in a sense, combining data analysis and art at times. I cant meditate the way most do, where you clear your mind, because my mind is always racing with thoughts, projects analysis. But now my mind was quiet, no train tracks, one train of thought was barely there and limping. I was horrified at what was going on and kept trying to find cognitive therapies to fix this. If I couldnt do basic math, then I would relearn with flashcards. If I couldnt speak, I was reading out loud to retrain. Since I couldnt remember anything, I was making tons of notes, writing timelines to orient myself. I am by nature a problem solver, so I was trying to fix me. Everything I read about TBIs and everyone I knew kept telling me to be patient, brain injuries take time. Self patience has never been my strong suit.

At the end of the 3 month mark I finally went in for a CT (no insurance). Friends were scaring me that I could have a slow bleed, blood clot or fracture and my upcoming project to document public lands and access obstructions could set something off worse. No blood clot, no slow bleed and no fracture, which meant that I could now go to the chiropractor about my jammed head. I knew he wouldnt see me otherwise. Got the neck jam fixed which tremendously lessened the pain.

Then about a month ago a friend made an arrangement with a fishing buddy of his that is a neuropsychiatrist and had EEG equipment (said we had to get my brain fixed, I do alot of conservation work). I went in for the test. Bad news, damage everywhere, delta waves (like when you are asleep, I felt like a zombie) across the board and seizure spikes. During the TBI tests I had a photic seizure on the blinking letter part. 

Dr. Olson began neurofield anti-seizure protocols using this cap and another protocol on the left side of my head where the major impact was. After the first session I felt a wee bit of clarity for the first time, the next day after the second session, I had my short term memory back. It was like a light switch had been flipped on. Kind of like hooking jumper cables up to a drained battery. I had 5 sessions that spanned a week and half. The shooting spike activity lessened as well. Then they ran another EEG, still delta activity across the board, but the shooting pain spikes were less and not as frequent. So they decided to do some gamma treatments to counter the delta, which reminded me of something I had researched years before on sound therapy to change a mood or assist in studying.

From what I read through some academic papers, I normally (pre injury) run high gamma daily. The gamma session flipped another switch and I got control of the bloody amygdala that had been running amok since the accident. I was calm, happy again, laughing and getting into the zone with my research. I could taste again and colors became colorful. I am a foodie, so lack of smell and taste hit hard and being an artist, the lack of color was a bummer. 

After some more research on the ears, smell (theta waves), bouncy eyes auditory and visual memory issues that have not been helped by any of this, I found connections with the hippocampus, lateral parietal cortex and the vestibular system with theta waves. Some academic papers involving rat studies (I hate that) with temporal lobe induced TBIs showed reduced gamma and theta waves, they couldnt smell or orient themselves. So I popped on my headset with a gamma and a second sound track of theta binaural beats. For the 2 1/2 days I have been doing this, my sense of smell is gradually returning and the eyes are not as bouncy so I have an easier time reading and remembering, the hearing is not as painful, but I have noticed that my audio waves are not nearly as strong as what they do with the neurofield therapy, so it will be interesting to see what a theta and gamma session with the cap will do.

I know that not everyone is built or wired the same. I am certainly not saying this is a golden bullet for everyone. This is new technology and the brain is very complex. But me knowing my body very well, being a problem solver researcher and having an awesome doctor willing to experiment, we are finding ways to help jump start my brain and the nutrient combination assists the brains natural healing. I would say that in these last few weeks since the neurofield therapy began, I have about 85% of me back again. Not to mention that much of what I have been learning and applying prevents the natural aging in brains as we get older, so that is a benefit for me to know and keep applying for the future of a healthy plastic brain.

I just wanted to share, in case it might help others to get their lives back. If anyone has questions about specifics, ask away. Sorry for the necessary wall.

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

3h3nxv,non_TBI,"So I've been fooling around with this girl for awhile now and naturally we've cycled through all your standard vanilla kinks and things were starting to wind down a bit. This wasn't a big deal though as neither of us is interested in anything more than casual sex so there's no pressure to keep things fresh and exciting.

That being said, a little bit ago she randomly messaged me saying she has something naughty to share and sends me cellphone footage of her with a vibrator doing some impressive pornography-grade squirting. She goes on to talk about how excited she is for teaching herself how, and we proceed to make plans to explore this further. Next thing I know she's cumming in my face like a chinese firefighter trying to extinguish a burning chemical factory while I'm right there dumping fuel on the flames.

Now, before I get carried away here, I'll just say, I'm a [M] nurse by trade, and I have no delusions about what's really going on. I can tell exactly where her 'juices' are coming from, and I've made peace with the fact that the girl is pissing in my face while I go down on her, no big deal.

So finally, to the point. She's been squirting in my face for a few weeks now and I've gotten enough in my mouth to know how it tastes. The most surprising thing about the experience is the fact that her piss didn't taste at all like I'd thought it would. Ranging from unflavored Gatorade to that bland tea they serve you at oriental restaurants (that you dump sugar packets into). I thought it was a fluke at first, but after repeatedly testing this observation, I'm quite certain that her piss tastes sweet, sometimes blatantly so.

The perverted side of me thought all this was kinky as hell, so I really didn't think on it too much until this morning. I just woke up and had a weird nurse's epiphany about it. Sweet urine. Glucose urine. Glycosuria. Jesus Christ. I'm a fucking dumbass. I race over to my bag where I keep my backup glucometer for work, wake her bleary-eyed ass up, and pricked her finger to check her blood sugar. 441. **Fuck!** Recheck. 453. **Shit!!** Asymptomatic, but hyperglycemic as fuck. She's got the Beetus. Diabetes. I broke the news as gently as I could, which was something to the tune of ""Holy shit fuck! That's some serious fucking diabetes! Call your doctor!"" Hysterics ensued. So now she's out to the doctors office and possibly the urgent care clinic for treatment, and I'm sitting here trying figure out a good cover story for how I knew..

TLDR; TIFU by breaking some bad news to a girl after she ""squirted"" in my face and I diagnosed her with diabetes after realizing her piss was unnaturally sweet.

---------------------------------

UPDATE: Insert the obligatory ""omg this went supernova!!1"" .. On a serious note though, thanks for the reddit gold~~en shower~~. This has been a long day and I haven't felt this cool on the Internet since that time I used a voice modulator in an MMORPG to convince my guild I was a black guy.

To bring things current, the girl is doing fine now, they've ran more thorough tests and strongly suspect she's a type 1 diabetic, but it'll take a few days and tests to confirm the preliminary results. She's got a lot on her mind, all I can think about though is how we went from casual fuck buddies to irreversibly connected by the act of getting her piss in my mouth.

Still, the response has been hilariously fantastic. While there's a lot of contention on whether this is a fuck up, I'll just say that a couple factors had stuck out to me personally that framed it like that, such as the fact that it took weeks for me to piece this all together, my majorly panicked reaction to it, and the resulting state of hysteria I had caused after scaring the girl half to death. That all kind of overshadowed the lucky guess I made, in my mind anyway. No longer though! Right now I feel like the fucking **man**, thanks for helping me see the cloud's golden lining!"
23uq8z,non_TBI,"This actually happened yesterday but whatever.

Okay, here we go. A little background about me. I'm young (mid 20's), I'm a guy, I'm white, and I'm a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan (American football). For this of you who aren't familiar with the sport, the Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys have a huge rivalry that has existed for years.
Here's where I fuck up.

So I'm at work (fast food), this day I had decided to wear my favorite Eagles shirt underneath of my uniform because why not. An older black guy walks into the store wearing a Cowboys hat, t-shirt, lanyard, and jacket. Upon seeing him most of my co-workers greeted him with a smile and a hello. I on the other hand, without thinking, greeted this 60 year old black guy with a ""we don't serve your kind here"". It instantly registered to me what I had said when all my co-workers looked at me in disbelief. I also realized that this poor guest couldn't see my t-shirt under my uniform. I instantly began apologizing and explaining. I took my uniform shirt off, showed him my phone background, my credit card, literally anything I could to show him I was trying to make a sports joke and not being a racist little shit.

After about 30 seconds of me explaining he started laughing so hard I thought he was gonna piss himself. Then he told me not worry about, and that he understood. I gave him his food for free. Then the manager wanted to have a little chit-chat. I wasn't fired but I was yelled at pretty well.

So that's the story of how sports made me look racist. "
2jgfhw,non_TBI,"So I'm hoping a load of people are going to come out in support of me here but I've got that sinking feeling I may be alone in this.

Our toilet broke so I was in shopping for new ones and the sales person joked (no doubt for the millionth time) that I'll want one that automatically puts the seat down after I'm finished with it. I 'joked' back and said if I didn't have a wife I could save money and not buy one with a seat and I'd never have to hear women complaining about putting it down again. To which he gave me a strange look and said ""but what about when you need to poop?"". I naturally pointed out that I'm a guy and therefore don't put the seat down, I sit on the rim of the bowl. Several embarrassing moments later, I realize that I've misunderstood my entire life and that guys do indeed use the toilet seat. I left empty handed and red faced.

Thinking about it now, it makes sense. Especially how men's restrooms have seats. But I just assumed it was a unisex/cost saving/oversight deal."
28epq5,non_TBI,"I had a meeting at work today. There were about 30 people in the meeting, and it was very important. It was only supposed to last 1-2 hours, but it went way over time. 3 hours after the meeting started, I really had to pee. But seeing as it was already an hour over time, I was confident I could hold it till the meeting was over. No one else had gotten up since the meeting started, and seeing as I've only been employed there for less than a month, I wasn't going to be the first one to do so.


 After 4 hours, my bladder was about to explode. I battled myself mentally, trying to convince myself to just go pee, while the other half of me didn't want to make a bad impression this early in my career. Right as I was about to jump up and just go for it, they wrapped up the meeting. As soon as they dismissed, I jumped from my seat and ran straight to the bathroom.


I started unzipping before i had barely made it into the bathroom, and I was already peeing 2 steps from the urinal. I settled in at the urinal and unleashed a fire-hydrant load of urine. Apparently I wasn't the only one who had to use the restroom, because there were more and more people coming in and using the toilets or standing along the wall behind me, waiting for the urinal to open up. 


Not wanting to stand there and pee forever, I tensed up by bladder, peeing as hard and as fast as I could. I guess when you do this you also hold your breath. Either way, I pushed way too hard, for way too long. I started getting really light headed and lost my balance. I took 2 steps back and passed out, falling straight on my back. I was probably only passed out in the floor for less than 5 seconds, but that was plenty enough time for about 10 of my coworkers to see me stumble back, fall in the floor with my dick hanging out of my pants, and then piss into the air like an angel statue in a park all over myself and the floor. I'm not sure I can show my face there tomorrow.


Tl;dr Tried to pee too hard, showed my dick to my coworkers, and pissed all over myself.



Edit- I was feeling better about the situation after reading some of your comments until I realized that someone had to clean up my urine after I left. Omgomgomg



Edit2- Holy shit guys, you popped my gold cherry not once, but twice! Not that it will help me when I have to go to work tomorrow, but it makes me happy for now at least! Thanks!

3im341,non_TBI,"Last night, my wife's boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner. On the drive over, my wife reiterated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression. 

I scoffed and arrogantly informed my silly wife that I always make good impressions. 

My wife's boss is a single lady in her fifties, so it was just the three of us. We chitchatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. She laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased.

Soon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. As I began to cut into my steak, I was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was.

Now,  I've had my fair share of rare steak. I prefer medium, but I can handle rare. This was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. I probably could've resuscitated the cow had I tried. Instead, I sat there fidgeting with my knife and fork, worrying about how I was going to get away with not eating this steak. 

Claim vegan-ism? No, I'd already feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak.

Just then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. As I looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head.

I knew I had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. I committed. I grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window.

Here's the big time FU.  The window wasn't open.  It was the cleanest fricking window you've ever seen in your life. That is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake.

My wife - who's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like I was an alien from another planet. This look then slowly morphed into more of a there-is-no-place-on-this-planet-you-can-ever-hide-from-me expression of demonic anger. 

My wife's boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. She took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look.

I just didn't know what to say. It felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. Finally, the best I could manage was ""I... I'm so sorry. I am such a clutz... I don't know... I was just cutting it.. and... it...  ... it slipped... just ask my wife, I really am a clutz... right honey?... (no help coming from that direction) ... I will clean this up... I can't believe this... I am so sorry"" etc... etc...

Both women continued to stare at me like I had escaped from the loony bin, as I smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin, dusted off the steak, and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation. I knew no one was buying the story.

I knew what I had to do. I sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak. 

I remained pretty quiet the rest of the evening. My wife's only two words to me since the incident are ""I'm fine"". 

TL;DR:  Tried to sneakily throw my under-cooked steak through an open window... only to find out it wasn't open.

Edit: Wow, thanks stranger!!

Update: Just got the first post-""I'm fine"" communication from my wife, via text, who is at work...

""good news, [boss' name] and i just had a good laugh over how much of a fucking idiot u are. i hope u know u will never live this down. love u you moron"""
3qkb4q,non_TBI,"Went to fancy movie theater with date. Decide to buy a bottle of wine. Go back to bar. Ask for two glasses. Bartender says he needs two ID's. I'm too lazy to go back to seats to grab dates ID. Tell him I'm alone and was embarrassed to ask for just one glass. He is clearly sympathetic. Idiot me then tries to sell the story and continue on about how lonely I've been recently. He tells me he's off in a few minutes and insists on watching the movie with me. I try to fight it but I could only argue so much without giving away the truth. Bartender is insistent. I text my date what's happening. Go back to theater with my new date. Sit a few rows in front of my first date. She has the stupidest grin on her face as me and the bartender (Jared) sit a couple rows in front of her. He ends up being super cool and bought me and him another bottle during the movie. Movie ends. I thank him for his gesture. He didn't even ask for my number or anything. I think Jared was just a genuine guy trying to comfort someone. Met back up with my date in the parking lot and thankfully she found the whole thing hilarious.

I don't deserve Jared."
2tdbig,non_TBI,"Let me tell you that I have made a bad mistake this evening. 

My girlfriend (who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time) said I am ""invited to dinner"" with her and her parents. I was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. But I knew it must be done. 

I met them nicely, I should tell you, and it started off in a good way. The idea slapped my mind that I should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing. 

When I saw that baked potatoes were served I got the idea that it would be very good if I pretended I did not know what potatoes was. That would be funny.

Well let me tell you: backfired on my face. I'll tell you how. 

So first when the potato became on my plate, I acted very interesting. I showed an expression on my face so as to seem that I was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. They did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. So I asked ""This looks very interesting. What is this?"" 

They stared at me and the mother said ""It's a baked potato.""  And I was saying ""Oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?"" 

And she was like ""A potato."" 

And I was like ""A 'potato', oh interesting. Never heard of a potato, looks pretty good."" 

And then they didn't see I was clowning, but thought I really did not know what is a potato. So I knew I would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if I admitted to making a bad joke, so what I did was to act as if it was not a joke but I committed to the act of pretending I didn't know what a potato is. 

They asked me, VERY incredulous, did I really not know what a potato is? That I never heard of a potato. I went with it and told them, yes, I did not ever even hear of a potato. Not only had I never eaten a potato I had never heard the word potato. 

This went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my ""fucked up antics"", and then the more insistent I was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking I DID know what a potato was.

Well let me tell you I had to commit 100% at this point. When I would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. At one point he said something like ""Enough is enough. You're fucking with us. Admit it.""  And I said ""Sir, before today I never heard of a potato. I still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. I don't know what to tell you."" 

Well let me tell you he got very annoyed. I decided to take a bite of the potato, and when I did I made a high pitched noise and said ""Taste's very strange!"" 

That is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying ""What are you doing?"" and my girlfriend went to some other room. 

Finally the father said I should ""Get the fuck out of his house"" and I said it was irrational to treat me like this just because I never heard of a potato before. Well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. 

Now in text messages I have been telling my girlfriend I really don't know what a potato is. The only way I can ever get out of this is for them to buy that I don't know what a potato is. 

I wish I never started it but I can't go back. I think she will break up with me anyway. "
351buo,non_TBI,"It never really made sense why over the course of three years I never got one comment or upvote/downvote for all of my posts. Reddit is an absolutely huge site, but after a couple years you begin to have your doubts. I decided to check to see if I could see my posts in an incognito browser and saw that none of my posts existed. What the fuck?! It was at that moment I realized that from my first post I was shadow banned and all of my contributions over three years never was viewed by a soul. I can't fucking believe I never caught onto it sooner. I've had my hand raised for three years and no one could ever see me and I never questioned it.

*check my post history to see the barren world. "
3fzvx8,non_TBI,"This literally just happened. I was walking to the spot I normally stand at on the train platform but I didn't have my contacts in so my vision/depth perception wasn't very good. I hear someone say hi so I turn to look as I'm walking and I see my friends sister with her arms outstretched. In my head I'm like oh alright she wants a hug, so I go in and give her a hug. I thought it felt kind of strange, like she wasn't really hugging back so I end the hug and back up to look at her. At this point I realize a) that it wasn't my friends sister but a random woman waiting for the train and b) she was extending her arms to someone who was behind me, who I noticed after the hug. They both looked pretty horrified so I didn't even really try to explain myself, I kind of just walked away without saying anything. 

TL;DR: went in for a hug, ruined someone's morning"
2livoo,non_TBI,"TIFU. More like more whole life really.

Hi, I my name's John. I've been lurking for a while, but I've finally made an account to post this. I need to get my life off my chest.  About me. I'm a 46 year old banker and I have been living my whole life the opposite of how I wanted. All my dreams, my passion, gone. In a steady 9-7 job. 6 days a week. For 26 years. I repeatedly chose the safe path for everything, which eventually changed who I was.

Today I found out my wife has been cheating on me for the last 10 years. My son feels nothing for me. I realised I missed my father's funeral FOR NOTHING. I didn't complete my novel, travelling the world, helping the homeless. All these things I thought I knew to be a certainty about myself when i was in my late teens and early twenties. If my younger self had met me today, I would have punched myself in the face. I'll get to how those dreams were crushed soon.

Let's start with a description of me when I was 20. It seemed only yesterday when I was sure I was going to change the world. People loved me, and I loved people. I was innovative, creative, spontaneous, risk-taking and great with people. I had two dreams. The first, was writing a utopic/dystopic book. The second, was travelling the world and helping the poor and homeless.
I had been dating my wife for four years by then. Young love. She loved my spontaneity, my energy, my ability to make people laugh and feel loved. I knew my book was going to change the world. I would show the perspective of the 'bad' and the 'twisted', showing my viewers that everybody thinks differently, that people never think what the do is wrong. I was 70 pages through when i was 20. I am still 70 pages in, at 46. By 20, I had backpacking around New Zealand and the Phillipines. I planned to do all of Asia, then Europe, then America (I live in Australia by the way). To date, I have only been to New Zealand and the Phillipines.

Now, we get to where it all went wrong. My biggest regrets. I was 20. I was the only child. I needed to be stable. I needed to take that graduate job, which would dictate my whole life. To devote my entire life in a 9-7 job. What was I thinking? How could I live, when the job was my life? After coming home, I would eat dinner, prepare my work for the following day, and sleep at 10pm, to wake up at 6am the following day. God, I can't remember the last time I've made love to my wife.

Yesterday, my wife admitted to cheating on me for the last 10 years. 10 years. That seems like a long time, but i can't comprehend it. It doesn't even hurt. She says it's because I've changed. I'm not the person I was. What have I been doing in the last 10 years? Outside of work, I really can't say anything. Not being a proper husband. Not being ME. Who am I? What happened to me? I didn't even ask for a divorce, or yell at her, or cry. I felt NOTHING. Now I can feel a tear as I write this. But not because my wife has been cheating on me, but because I am now realising I have been dying inside. What happened to that fun-loving, risk-taking, energetic person that was me, hungering to change the world? I remember being asked on a date by the most popular girl in the school, but declining her for my now-wife. God, I was really popular with the girls in high school. In university/college too. But i stayed loyal. I didn't explore. I studied everyday. 

Remember all that backpacking and book-writing I told you about? That was all in the first few years of college. I worked part-time and splurged all that I had earned. Now, I save every penny. I don't remember a time I spend anything on anything fun. On anything for myself. What do I even want now?

My father passed ten years ago. I remember getting calls from mom, telling me he was getting sicker and sicker. I was getting busier and busier, on the verge of a big promotion. I kept putting my visit off, hoping in my mind he would hold on. He died, and I got my promotion. I haven't seen him in 15 years. When he died, I told myself it didn't matter what I didn't see him. Being an atheist, I rationalized that being dead, it wouldn't matter anyway. WHAT WAS I THINKING? Rationalizing everything, making excuses to put things off. Excuses. Procrastination. It all leads to one thing, nothing. I rationalized that financial security was the most important thing. I now know, that it definitely is not.
I regret doing nothing with my energy, when I had it. My passions. My youth. I regret letting my job take over my life. I regret being an awful husband, a money-making machine. I regret not finishing my novel, not travelling the world. Not being emotionally there for my son. Being a damn emotionless wallet.

If you're reading this, and you have a whole life ahead of you, please. Don't procrastinate. Don't leave your dreams for later. Relish in your energy, your passions. Don't stay on the internet with all your spare time (unless your passion needs it). Please, do something with your life while your young. DO NOT settle down at 20. DO NOT forget your friends, your family. Yourself. Do NOT waste your life. Your ambitions. Like I did mine. Do not be like me.

Sorry for the long post, just had to get it out there.

TL:DR I realised I let procrastination and money stop me from pursuing my passions when I was younger, and now I am dead inside, old and tired.





Edit: I am quite overwhelmed at the response, thank you for your time. I had posted on a whim, and did not expect the reception.

In regards to my post, I must admit I was quite emotional at the time. As I read what I had written earlier, I can't stop myself from noticing an abundance of spelling and grammatical mistakes, phrases that I would not usually say. I don't think I have used Capital Locks so much in my life. 
However I will not edit them. That would not do it justice.

I have read many of the replies and will try my best to answer the reoccurring questions. I will add that the replies have given me a new perspective of life, Reddit and humanity in general. The amount of encouragement and humour persists to amaze me. Despite my situation, I even found myself laughing at a few of the comments.

What my plans are.
I am planning to cut down my hours substantially. I will take a new job if I have to, as I am relatively well-off. I am going to talk to my wife. Divorce is currently not what I have in mind and I hope that our communication and relationship will improve. If it doesn't, then so be it. We will both move on. I see there are quite a number of negative comments about her, however I am going to have to say in her defence, she really is a lovely person. She is smart, empathetic and has a great sense of humour. I'm not saying it was okay for her to do what she did, but she's not an evil person. I know that. We were both in the fault. We let communication dwindle, and with it, our relationship. There is so much more to being a head of house than just being able to bring in the money. A steady balance of emotional connection, love and finance is what I will strive to give.

My son. I don't any anything about him. I really don't. I have unknowingly distanced myself from him; I only see him around dinner time. I do not recall having a proper conversation with him, it's quite preposterous now that I think about it. I'm not exactly sure how I'll start bonding with him, I have become quite a boring person. However, I plan to change that. I refuse to be a poor role model. I will ensure that he does not make the same mistake I did with my family. I have decided I am going to start watching his basketball games and rugby games on Saturdays. I never have, due to work, but I will ensure that I do. Perhaps I will even play video games with him. There was a time I had a collection of SNES games, and I wasn't half bad either. Who knows, I might really connect with my son, and it seems to be something he enjoys.

In regards to the novel and travelling, I admit, I am a different person from my youth. I no longer have the creativity and desire to complete the novel. When I found the long-forgotten 70 pages, the writing was no longer mine. I have changed substantially in 26 years. I am sorry to disappoint as so many of you seemed incredibly keen to read it. However, I am just as excited to read the stories of all of you aspiring writers that have expressed their passion!
The travelling, I might still do. Family trips probably, in the school holidays. Maybe with my wife every now and then, if she'd have me. 

I can't turn back time and see my father for a final time, though my mother is still alive. She lives in London, so visits are quite difficult. However, I will make an effort to see her. I do love my parents. I only wish I had not prioritised them as I did.

In regards to the advice I have given. I stand by what I said. Live your life. Do not procrastinate and let lethargy stop you. However, I might add, avoid living in poverty. I have had the good fortune to have had never experienced hunger or homelessness. I would imagine chasing your ambitions and being happy would be considerable more difficult without proper nutrition and living standards! I believe someone mentioned their dream was financial stability. I say, that is just as valiant as any dream to have. We are all different and are missing different things in our lives, be honest with yourself and you'll know what you really want.
I believe there were arguments upon my language and university/college or what not. I will clarify that, although Australians generally call tertiary education 'university' here, I have made small efforts to pertain to Americans, as they are the main users, at least I assume. And yes, university/college was free when I attended. I believe Australians now are able to attend them relatively free (upfront) and can pay their fees after they graduate.

I believe I have covered the general scope of questions. 

P.S. Thank you for the gold, I do appreciate it, but they aren't of real value to me. Perhaps if Reddit ever includes a re-gifting gold feature, I will gift them to some of the commenters. And yes, please stop sending me gold! I also believe someone tried to even donate to me? I assure you, money is not what I read. Please save it for yourself!

I don't think I'll come back to Reddit, unless i hear about a way to re-gift gold. I thank you all for your sympathy, your time, and I wish all the best for those in difficult situations. I have faith in your capacity and ability to change, to become happy, to help yourselves. Because after all, you're the person in the best position to.
And no, I am not considering religion, I just do not have the correct mindset. I am logical to the point that I cannot, however that is not to say religion isn't bad, it gives people the hope and sense after death which I really do envy.

Sincerest of Regards,

John.

1yf68c,non_TBI,"Background. My cousin and i (both male) were having a sleep over when we were around 6 years old. We started talking about girls and about how they could pee, we couldn't figure it out so we started to come up with ideas. One thing led to another and we started talking about how to have sex with a girl, since we had never seen a vagina we thought maybe it was the butt. Curious we proceeded to put our little peckers into each others butts and just lay there. One on his stomach and the other on top, we would switch positions. At the time i thought nothing of it, but years down the road when i was a teenager i realized what the hell had happened. I tried my best to ignore this little piece of history and so did my cousin. But every time we would hang out as we grew up you could tell it was still awkward and was only getting worse. Fast forward 20 years and we are both married, out at dinner on a double date and we had an obviously gay waiter. My cousins wife remarks, ""i don't understand how they can have sex with other men, that is just weird"" I causally said ""its pretty easy"". Both wives look at me and i go ""what, like you've never had causal gay sex with your cousin when you were 6 before?"". My stupid brain thought this would be a good way to finally break the ice on the situation, i meant it to be so ridiculous that the wives would never think i was serious. Instead it led to a lengthy conversation of  ""what the hells"" and ""oh my fucking gods"" as my cousin and i tried to explain to our wives why we had gay sex in a walk in closet at my grandmothers house at the age of 6. 

TIFU by letting my wife and cousin's wife know that we had gay sex when we were children. In a restaurant, with a gay waiter. Im sure people overheard. "
3hh34a,non_TBI,"I often play a game with my son where we have a martial arts duel with various fruits and vegetables. For example, i'd be throwing grapes as if they were ninja stars, and he'd be defending with a cucumber samurai sword. It's just one of those strange family traditions I guess. 

Anyway, last night I was preparing dinner and enjoying a few glasses of wine. I felt in my element chopping potatoes when suddenly I was struck in the side of my face by a celery stick. I jumped around in battle mode while letting out a war cry. Unfortunately I didn't put my knife down before this flailing maneuver and ended up slicing my son's hand open. He screamed, I screamed. The doctor reported me to child services. 

EDIT: I'm his mother for goodness' sake. 






"
2bad5k,non_TBI,"So my coworker (call him Jeff) is asexual, but his parents kept trying to get him a girlfriend. When he kept rejecting them, his parents eventually asked if he was gay. He decided to pretend he was and said he was already seeing a coworker and then asked me to pretend to be with him, even going so far as to offer money (I don't really know enough people to care about my reputation and could think of worse ways to earn money, so I agreed). His parents wanted to meet me. The original plan was to meet his family and leave a very bad first impression so he would have reason to not bring me around them. Well I got there and it turns out his family is about the most fucking awesome family I've ever met. I expected everybody to either tiptoe around the gay thing, or be very over zealous about supporting it, either way I would overreact and make an ass out of myself. Turns out they treated me just like they would anybody else, so I couldn't do that. Then his twin sister (call her Jenny) comes out and decides to try to make me uncomfortable by sitting on my lap, (I didn't mind) and asking questions that most would consider inappropriate, I kind of fell in love with her that night. Well I ended up leaving a good impression, and was invited to dinner the next night to meet his other sister and her husband. That dinner went great as well, so I ended up just saying ""fuck it, I'll come over whenever they invite me and just hope we don't slip up"". Things went pretty well over next few months, I got along with everybody and kept telling myself I'd ask Jenny out after we told them the truth. Well Jeff ended up getting an apartment and moving out of his parents house, he needed a roommate and I volunteered (I wanted to move out of my parent's house anyway). One night I get back from work to find a fucking candle lit dinner waiting for me, turns out he really was gay and had a crush on me, and decided the best way to seduce me would be an elaborate scheme to trick me into moving in with him. Needless to say I rejected him, and he was actually surprised when I did. So he calls his mom crying and said I cheated on him. His family hates me now, especially Jenny. They won't believe a word out of my mouth, because it's his word against mine. So now I live(signed a 1 year lease) and work with a guy who thinks he's in love with me. I did learn a valuable lesson though; if you are going to live a lie, record some kind of proof that it's a lie.

Tldr; Pretended to be gay to help friend get parents off his back, find out he wasn't pretending. Now I live with a gay guy who thinks he's in love with me.

Update (07/21); Convinced Jenny to let me explain the situation from my point of view. She believes me but said she won't side against her twin even if he's in the wrong. Now my only hope is to convince him to tell the truth. 

Update 2 (07/21); Just went through more drama in an hour than I have in the last 5 years. Basically after Jenny left she went home and confronted Jeff (he slept at their house). They then invited me to come clear the air. I told them the same thing I told Jenny, then Jeff told his side of the story but spun it just enough to convince them that he didn't think we were pretending, and that I led him on. He also left in the part about me cheating, he said he caught me with a girl and that's what sparked this whole mess. Since I can't disprove anything he said, they now believe that I'm a sack of shit that likes to lead on gay men for fun while I'm out sleeping around (I've only been with one girl). And to salt the wound just a little bit more; Jenny called me a creep for letting her sit on my lap, apparently it was only cute when I was gay. The only person who even questioned Jeff's lying ass is his older sister, and she said the same thing Jenny did, ""I won't side against my family, even if they are wrong"". So I just lost what was basically my second family, and I'm either stuck living with captain dipshit or stuck with an apartment I can't afford alone.

Update 3 (07/21); So things just went from a bad situation to a disastrous one. My boss just called me on my day off to tell me Jeff asked to be put on a different schedule than me. Apparently Jeff told him I threatened to kick the shit out of him, and I fucked up more royally than I've ever fucked up before, I said ""I never said anything like that and to tell Jeff to prove it"" and now I've got to go in later to discuss this situation and he told me I was probably going to be suspended until further notice. That motherfucker attacked my job, this means war.

Update 4 (07/21); Well I called my landlord and am meeting him on his lunch break today, also somebody I know offered to get me some legal counsel so I've got a meeting later today to discuss my options. Also is there a better way to do this update thing? I'm not sure if this is correct form for this kind of thing.

Update 5 (07/21); I just got a call from the coworker that knew a bit about it, he got together a group of our coworkers and they pulled Jeff aside and ""convinced"" him to admit he was lying to the manager, so the job part might be resolved. Now we just need to come to an understanding about the apartment. I'm willing to live with him for the remainder of the lease if he's willing to sign a waiver or something stating that this is over. I'm not going to try to fix things with his family, you guys have rightfully pointed out that it isn't worth it. I'll probably end up being a hermit after this mess.

Update 6 (07/21); Just got a confirmation that he came clean to our manager, he's being sent home early and we both have to come back later tonight to resolve this situation, he didn't give me any information about the pending suspension but I'm optimistic. When he gets here I'm going to sit down with him and apologize for everything I've done to hurt him (real or imagined) and then hopefully we can settle this like civilized people. Then after I find someone to take over the lease I'm going to go on my merry way and hope for the best.

Update 6.5; u/Cyae1 narrated this for some reason and it's funny as hell! here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDqGkA72DHw&list=PLl0DkyQa9Aqu_aWjvjzvySIZC8PHUPPO6&index=18

Update 7 (07/21); So Jeff came home and we had a fairly short but very concise discussion. He agreed to put this whole thing behind him on the condition that I let him continue the lie with his family. I agreed to apologize to his family  from the bottom of my heart for cheating on him and admit that I was leading him on. In return he agreed to make a formal confession video admitting that we were both at fault (omitting the cheating and leading on altogether) and he would let it die here and now. We sealed the deal by punching each other and unknown to him, I recorded the whole conversation on my laptop. I won't do anything with said recording unless he forces my hand.

Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart, your comments have helped me think through this mess and not react in a physical manner. This is mostly likely my last update, unless something drastic happens with the landlord, lawyer or workplace. Also he said he'd try to make Jenny apologize for calling me a creep, even he agrees she can't get mad about something she initiated in the first place. And the movie rights go to whoever gets a script written up first, just as long as the actor portraying me is a handsome motherfucker.

Update 7.5; Holy shit this hit the front page, and some kind soul gave me gold! Thank you whoever you are!

Update 8 (07/22); I'm sorry for updating so late, but I fell asleep after getting home and just woke up. I talked to our landlord and told him we had a falling out and even though it's solved I wanted to know if it was possible to get out of the lease, if I could find somebody else willing to take it on. He said he'd be willing to let me draw up a sublet lease (or something along those lines, my memory is fuzzy right now) so if I can find somebody willing to live with dipshit I'll be free. After that I talked to the lawyer, he said that it's illegal to record somebody without consent so if I tried to use the recording I could face criminal charges, he advised I erase the recording. Furthermore he said I could file a lawsuit for slander and something about character, but I'd be open to a countersuit and Jeff has at least 5 people who would be willing to testify on his behalf. Then he told me a restraining order would be a terrible idea, it would be extremely obvious that I was only filing it either as retaliation or as a preemptive legal defense. So he advised me to avoid antagonizing Jeff in any way and hope he doesn't find out about the recording. After that I went to tell my own family what was happening and things didn't go well, my mother first said I was pretending to be gay the same way that guys say they were joking after being rejected. Then after I played the recording she admitted she'd rather have a gay son who's in denial than a son who would manipulate an entire family. So needless to say we aren't speaking at the moment, my siblings are refusing to take sides for the most part, so no help there either. After that me and Jeff met up at work for the meeting with our boss. We both got written up for unprofessional conduct and told this was first and only warning, next time there is drama between us we both get fired. And he's going to put Jeff on a later shift than me so we don't have very much overlap in schedule. Next we went to his family's house so I could make my apology, I decided to follow the advice of the people on here and didn't support his lie about leading him on or cheating, but I didn't directly deny them either so I kept up my part of the deal. After my apology (I even managed a few tears, it wasn't exactly hard) they basically took turns berating me but I took it and didn't argue or defend myself, after that I told them they'd probably never see or hear from me again and left. On my way out the sister's husband followed me out and loudly threatened to fuck me up if he ever saw me again. But he sent me a text like 5 minutes apologizing and said he was just trying to earn some points with them by defending their honor, and that he actually (secretly) was on my side. I basically just rolled my eyes and told him to fuck off. I think that's pretty much it, I'm still shaking like a motherfucker but at least the worst part is over.

Update 9 (07/24); Well I got fired today, our boss was watching through the security footage from the other day and saw the coworkers approach Jeff in ""a menacing manor"" and he decided Jeff only dropped his complaint against me because they threatened him. He also suspended two of the guys involved and fired another. So I'm seriously considering just skipping town right about now.

Final update (07/27); It's been a couple days since my last update, and I don't know how many people will even see this but I'll do it anyway. I've decided to leave town, it's next to impossible to get a job here without connections, and I don't have many, and to make it worse, I was fired from my previous job. Not to mention I either hate or am hated by just about everybody here, and I could use some distance from my family. So I don't see much future in California for me. I'm going to tell my landlord the full story and show him the recording in hopes that he'll let me out of the lease. Even if he doesn't I'm willing to risk taking a ding to my credit (and Jeff's) and just leave anyway. An Xbox friend of mine lives in Texas and told me he'd help me get started if I choose to move to his town, but I'm not eager to blindly trust somebody I barely know (that's what started this shit in the first place). So do you guys have any good advice for me? I'm leaning toward Texas because it would be nice to have somebody to help me get started, but if you guys have a better place please share. A place with fairly low cost of living and plenty of job opportunities would be nice. Anywhere except Colorado or Minnesota.

Some people have asked for another update so here it is (08/05?): I have decided on Texas, my xbox friend has been helping me apply for jobs and look at apartments. I am still living with Jeff and we haven't had any more drama. We both basically pretend that the other one doesn't exist. Jenny actually sent me a text and apologized for her part in this, and I told her to go fuck herself. I've sort of made peace with my mother, but it' an uneasy kind of peace. And my old coworker that got fired for threatening Jeff helped me get an unofficial job moving furniture. They call me when they need help with a delivery or something, and pay me cash.  I considered showing the recording to my old boss to try to get my old job back but decided that I really don't want to work for somebody that jumps to conclusions based on circumstantial evidence regardless of the actual story. If I missed anything let me know and I'll elaborate.

Another quick update for you guys (08/12): I applied at a temp agency last week and they got me a part time job working nights. Tonight is my first night. I also got a job interview next week for a full time day job. If I get it I plan to work both and save up as rapidly as I can. After a month or two I'd be able to move to Texas with enough to have a safety net while I get set up there. Nothing new on the Jeff situation. I usually retreat to my room when he gets home and only come out for food. 

Yet another update (08/14): Things went well at the part time job and they will be keeping me on (they don't know I'm leaving). I went to make peace with my mom and basically told her we needed to agree to disagree before I left, because I probably won't be visiting for a very long time. After a while she actually told me she was considering packing up the family and coming to Texas with me. Nothing is concrete yet but it sounds like she was serious. So I might actually have my family to help me.

Another Update (08/17): Either next week or three weeks from now I'll be going to Texas to work out a place to live. After that I'll come back here, grab a U-Haul and start the process. My family is coming with me, so it will be a bit more complicated but I'm glad to have them. I'll be passing through Bakersfield (CA), Tuscon (AZ), Waco, Dallas, and Austin (TX). I'm still leaning toward Dallas but am open to any of those. If anybody has anything to say about those areas I'd appreciate it. 

Also, I have a football card collection that I'm going to sell if it's worth enough to make a difference. And my mother has a collection of foreign money/coins that she's willing to sell. Does anybody here have any advice on how to go about selling either of them?

Update to answer some common questions/accusations:

""OP is overreacting by moving to a new town just because of some drama""

 I'm not leaving town because of Jeff, I've wanted to leave California for a while now. Being fired just lit a fire under my ass. I wasn't going to seriously consider moving as long as I had a decent job. 

""OP should fuck/beat up Jeff""

I'm not going to take any sort of revenge, I don't want to invite any more problems into my life right now. I've been talking to another Redditor that I trust and with their help I've written a letter that I'll leave for him when I go. Basically it explains that his actions have severe consequences, and has an open to interpretation but vaguely suicidal ending. Then I'll create a new facebook and abandon my old one (he's still on my friends)

""What about the recording?""

I'm not going to do anything with the recording unless he decides to fuck with my life some more.

""Why not Colorado/Minnesota?"" 

Because I fucking hate snow

""Have you decided where you're going?""

We've settled on Houston, will be leaving as soon as my mother gets her next paycheck. We'll just convoy up and hope to get into a house quickly. My temp agency has offices in Houston that will get me a job fairly quickly.

""OP show pics of Jenny/Jeff"" 

I'm not going to provide any personal information on here, not mine nor anybody else's.

For all of you who gave me words of encouragement/advice; Thank you from the bottom of my heart. If I ever get rich, I'll give all of you puppies or something.

Ok people have been asking for another update, and I live to please: I am still in Cali, we're still going to Texas. We're going to put everything in storage except what we can fit in my car or mom's van, then just convoy up to Houston and find a place to live. We'll probably leave in two weeks. Nothing new on the Jeff front, I've only seen him a few times this last week. I still hide in my room every time he comes home. You can call it petty but I call it not tempting fate. I'll try to update when something happens. 

'Nother update for you guys: We've decided on San Antonio instead of Houston, and will be leaving on the 15th. I've been having kind of a moral dilemma about the goodbye, the note I've written to him might be a bit too far.  I'm trying to find the right combination of words to make him realize what he did was not right, and maybe prevent him from doing it in the future. 

Probably the last update before I move: We're still committed to San Antonio and will be leaving sometime next week, probably on Thursday. We've got a storage shed and have been moving all our shit into it this last week, and my sister's boyfriend has decided to come with us. So we've got another driver and more potential for income. My last day at the temp job is on sunday and I've gotten two different managers to write up letters of recommendation as well as about 6 references. So the odds of my landing a job have gone up significantly. Still haven't been able to sell my football cards so I'll probably just keep them. Also at the request of u/Doctor_Jagermeister I posted my letter to Jeff in the comments. [Here's the link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2bad5k/tifu_by_pretending_to_be_gay/ckg5vh6) I've said it before but I'll say it again;  It's been good having so many people offer up advice and support, I truly wish I could do something for all of you in return. To the people who've offered me a drink or a hug; if I pass through your respective town I'll hit you up! To everybody else; Thank you for being awesome!

Quick update for those still following this: We have not made it to San Antonio just yet. We've had delay after delay and things are not going very well so far. Car problems, money problems and too much road work. We are in Santa Rosa, New Mexico right now and have about 600 miles left to go. We should make it there tomorrow evening if things go smoothly, after that we'll try to get into a house but it will be difficult as we have less money than we expected to, but I'm trying to stay optimistic about everything. 

Another quick update: We went to see houses today with the most kind and benevolent realtor in the country. We are going to submit the application tomorrow and hopefully it won't take very long as staying in a hotel is draining our money at an alarming rate. I've applied for a few jobs and am going to a temp agency tomorrow to see if I can't get anything immediately. Jeff called yesterday and I didn't answer, he left a message crying and basically telling me how sorry he is. I doubt I'll be calling him back any time soon.

Final update: We got into a house, just got our internet turned on today. I'm still working on getting a job but things are looking up for us.

This post won fuck up of the year! I wasn't planning on doing an update but after winning this I feel compelled to do one. So here it is:
Life is pretty good for me now. I made it past the probationary period at my new job. It's probably the best job I've ever had, I love both the work and the co workers and my managers are fucking awesome. Nothing new from Jeff. My old landlord hasn't contacted me so I don't think I'm in trouble for breaking the lease. I think that pretty much sums it up. Thank you guys again for all the awesome shit you do, and I'm sorry if you sent me a PM that I never replied to, I still get too many to reply to without resorting to something generic like ""thanks, you too"".

TLDR: Pretended to be gay to help friend. Found out he wasn't pretending. He was pissed that I turned him down, destroyed my relationships and got me fired. I moved across the country. "
3gipy7,non_TBI,"I (22F) am a server at a restaurant. Last week we had lone male customer come in, and asked to be seated by the window (my area of serving) we immediately hit it off. He was older than me, had a sexy Scottish accent, hilariously witty and very out-going. I was thrilled when he left his number on the back of the bill. Fast forward one week: after a few small talk texts we decided to meet up, and agree at 3:00pm at the city fountain, right downtown in a busy area. I arrive a few minutes early, and decide to sit in the shade of a nearby statue and wait. Within seconds an older, relativley handsome guy wearing sunglasses approaches me. ""Hey, it's great to see you!""
I smile and greet him, and he immediatley lunges into some big 5 minute long story about a fender bender he got into on his way driving to meet me, and apologized profusseley for being late. By this point I could clearly tell he didn't have a Scottish accent. ""You don't have nearly as much of an accent that I thought you did, am I crazy?"", he laughed and gave me a weird look, agreeing how I must be crazy because he has never had an accent. We continue walking slowly on the downtown strip, making more small talk. By this point I had a feeling something was off.. I could've sworn the accent was the main reason I had been drawn to him in the first place. When he asks me how to produce my name, as the ""O with the dots"" is relativley uncommon in our country. I say my name (which has the letter O not Ö) and he is immediatley giving me a weird look. We stop in the middle of the pathway surrounded by people walking. He takes off his sunglasses, revealing an unfamiliar face. You're not Ben are you?"" I ask awkwardly, to which he shakes his head. We both burst out in laughter, realizing we clearly fucked up. ""I'm supposed to be meeting a girl I've met online, down bedside that statue at 2:30! She's a redhead but I haven't a picture of her face!"" We speed walk back to the fountain, both almost in tears due to the hilariously embarrassing moment that we found ourselves in. We part ways just before the fountain, and i see my REAL date sitting reading a book. Didnt mention the ridiculous event that happened moments before, and had a terrific date. 

TL;DR  Went on a first date, ended up being the wrong date, found my real date eventually."
3iymtr,non_TBI,"This happened a few years ago and I was living in Zimbabwe at the time, and I was having a pretty bad day, I was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. If youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

Half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
I get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....Then I here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so I wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. SO i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

I explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where I am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and I dont have the best memory so I didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, I take down his number so i can repay him later on. At this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. Im about 100 feet from the house and i see my Son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like Ive been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

I still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


So it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon.
My son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

TL;DR Got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and I somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

2zlwos,non_TBI,"So this morning I was in court disputing a traffic ticket when I called the judge ""your majesty""... "
2eyut9,non_TBI,"This happened yesterday, so if you're out there bus girl, I want you to know. It's not what you think. 

Yesterday after working a grueling shift at the old internet mines (I'm a network engineer). I got on the bus to go home just like always. Ahead of me in line is a young woman who is looking very pretty, she has red hair and a nice polka-dot blouse. I don't think much of it, but we end up sitting across from each other on the bus. I'm reading something that was on the front page but get the urge to look up and see her face. I had only seen the back of her head before. I glance up and to my delight, she is very pretty! Horray! I have seen one more pretty girl in the world than I did before. 

Except mid-glance she looks up at me. I realize I'm probably slack-jawed and not really paying attention. I look down. I don't really know why, I don't have a problem talking to girls. I have a long time girlfriend and I don't talk to very many women these days. 

I'm feeling a bit sheepish and awkward, so I glance up again for some reason. A second after I do - she looks up at me and catches me starring at her, or at least she thinks I'm starring at her.  She screws up her face a little bit. I'm not even that ugly, oh well. Twice in a row I've been caught slipping. 

None of this matters because the mid-way stop at the park-and-ride is coming up, and usually everyone gets off the bus here. She stands up as the bus stops and I breath in relief. I also stand up in search of a more comfortable seat (The bench seats that face each-other kind of suck). So I'm waiting for people to clear out, and people are getting off the bus. But on today of all days MUCH more people are getting on the bus, much more than usually. Must be a football game tonight or something.

She isn't getting off the bus. She sits by the window in a regular seat. I look around - all of the other seats are being filled quickly. I walk to the back of the bus, nothing. I look around, there is nothing. The universe's cruel game of musical chairs is playing ""Creep"" by Radiohead. I sit down next to her. She looks at me like a deer in the headlights and I think she is actually afraid.

Flash forward 10 minutes and I've moved seats as we are the only two people left on the bus. She is looking over at me regularly, probably making sure I'm not furiously masturbating or something.

Last stop. My stop. Her stop. Our stop. 

We get off the bus, she goes first and stars walking in my house's direction. We slowly walk together, for a few blocks, she keeps checking over her shoulder. She finally turns down a side-street and I think maybe I can relax now. I turn down my street. I breath a sigh of relief, finally the coast is clear and I don't feel like I'm stalking anyone. 

Then she appears, she clearly took a fake-turn to get away from me, and I met up with her on my road. 

She starts running up the steps to MY building and I'm freaking the fuck out like what is happening, am I actually stalking this girl?  I keep walking towards my building, I just want to go home.

She turns and yells at me from the stairs ""Stop fucking following me fucking creep""

This is how I met my new neighbor. "
314oc1,non_TBI,"So I have been setting this prank up for about 3 weeks now, but unfortunately the fruits of my labor came to fruition yesterday. All for the best I guess. 

Background: My wife and I are very healthy and we eat the same thing for breakfast every day, well maybe a solid 350 days a year. It is egg whites and toast. It has got to the point that if I don't eat this for breakfast my entire day feels ""off.""  I put salsa on my eggs while she uses ketchup and she has to have ketchup or else she will not eat breakfast. We have a backup bottle or two in the pantry just in case she runs out. 

3 weeks ago: I notice that her bottle is running pretty low and she has to actively shake the bottle to get the last remnants out. We are pretty earth conscious as well, so nothing goes to waste, use until the last drop! There is still just enough left in the bottle that I can tell she is thinking that she shouldn't recycle it just yet and puts it back into the fridge. I notice this thought process going on in her head and decide I should mess with her. Once we finish up breakfast she goes to get ready. I take one of the full bottles of ketchup and add just enough to the almost empty bottle so that she will have the amount needed for breakfast the next day. Breakfast the next day rolls around and she does the same thing adds ketchup to her breakfast and decides there is just enough to save and puts it back in the fridge. I again refill the bottle with just enough for the next day. I should also mention that she is short, I hid the refill bottle at the top of the pantry so she could not see that it had been opened and used. 

2 weeks ago: After 7 days slyly watching her add ketchup to her breakfast I can begin to see an intrigued look on her face when she is prepping her breakfast. She doesn't say anything, but you can tell she has taken notice of the bottle. This goes on for another 7 days.  

1 week ago: Breakfast continues to go off without a hitch and every time she adds the ketchup to her breakfast she gets a little twinkle in her eye, like she really really wants to say something about it, but doesn't want me to make fun of her being crazy and thinking the ketchup bottle is never ending. To the point that she will look at me, start to say something and then stop herself change the subject and put the bottle away. I have never looked forward to breakfast so much in my entire life! 

All this week: She is on the verge of saying something everyday. Its becoming hard to not laugh while watching her add the ketchup to her eggs, but I am laughing hysterically on the inside. At this point I have used roughly a half bottle of ketchup refilling the other one. [This is all I can imagine when watching her](http://i.giphy.com/5yLgoceFO3BdJW1zvFu.gif) 

Yesterday: She adds ketchup to her breakfast and looks me directly in the eye and dead serious says, ""u/thiscopisadick we have a fucking magical ketchup bottle."" I could not control my laughter and proceed to loose my shit while she tries to explain to me how she has used the exact same bottle of ketchup for 3 weeks and it has been almost ""empty"" the entire time. She now thinks I am laughing because of her belief in magic and she is trying as hard as possible to convince me that she is serious and it IS magic. I proceed to go into the pantry, take out the half empty bottle of ketchup and place it on the counter. It all finally clicks in her head and at that moment the empty ketchup bottle clicked into my head, but don't care because I made a magic ketchup bottle happen so I am essentially Jesus. 

TL;DR made my wife believe we had a magic ketchup bottle, but it hurt just as much as normal bottle when flung at my face. 

Edit #1: WOW GOLD!! YEEOOWW!! Thanks so much everyone! 

Edit #2: Yes you can leave ketchup out of the refrigerator. It doesn't go bad for months given the preservatives, many restaurants do this. It does oxidize eventually, but you can tell from the color change and it tastes a little off. It will not make you sick for a long time! Also, the ketchup bottle was plastic, I did not die. 

Edit #3: To all the people saying bread is not healthy, seeing as I do not have celiac disease my body can process it just fine. It is organic, sprouted grain protein whole wheat. You can find it at a Trader Joe's near you. Also, the egg whites come already separated from the yolk in a container, so they are not being thrown out. 

Edit #4: To all the people saying that this is not a healthy breakfast, I suppose you are the people who put no dressing on salad, which sounds terrible. Using any dressing sparingly will not make the meal unhealthy. My wife is a dietician in a hospital food knowledge is kind of her thing.  

Edit #5: This got WAY more attention than I ever imagined and yes, we do stupid stuff like this all the time to each other. "
2r4jbb,non_TBI,"My mom got me some chocolate covered pretzel bits for Christmas and they literally looked like shit.  I told my parents and they said they look like pretzels and told me to stop being ungrateful.  After everyone went to bed, I put a few of my chocolate pretzels outside of the cat litter box to make it look like the cat got shit everywhere.  The next morning I come downstairs and my family is complaining about the cat shit, so I decide to be funny and pick one up and take a bite out of it and laugh at everybody because I was right about the pretzels looking like shit.  I take a bite.  It's soft.  It's not a chocolate pretzel, it's fucking shit.  My family is howling with laughter as I run to the bathroom.  They knew what I had done and replaced my pretzels with actual cat shit.  I don't think I can ever show my face around my family again.  They keep telling me I can clean the litter box if I get hungry.

EDIT 3: I'm glad so many enjoy my suffering.  I went to the doctor a few weeks ago and I am toxoplasmosis free.  Thanks for all of the concern!  My family still teases me every so often.  I am dreading a family get together next month."
35yim3,non_TBI,"So for those of you who don't know, there is a Google Survey app for android you can download where you get to take surveys. After completing the surveys, you receive anywhere from $0.10 to $2.00 for doing a survey to use on the Google Play Store. 

Now with these surveys I have always lied. The more I'd fabricate these answers, the more ""valuable"" it makes my opinion. The more valuable my opinion is, the more surveys I get which means more play store credit. If I had been honest, I would not have gotten any surveys much like when I told my friend about the app and never got a survey after his first one. So far, I've received about $35 in Play Store Credit by doing these surveys. 

So this morning, I got a Google Survey on my tablet. It was a 3 question survey. The survey asked if I had ever been to a water park called Kelp Water Parks. I said yes. Then it asked what my favorite slide was. I just chose a random name of a ride and proceeded to the next question.

Only then did I find out it wasn't a survey, but it was designed to fish out people like me. People who lie on their surveys. It told me that the Kelp Water Park didn't exist. Google then proceeded to scold me saying lying is a bad thing and it will most likely not consider me for future surveys. Google caught me lying and left me feeling like I lied to my own father. 

TLDR: Lied to Google. Received a virtual spanking over their survey app. "
2mlo1u,non_TBI,"So I'm pulling a long day, up at 3.30am to get to the airport, pull a full day working in a different country, and head back to the airport for 6pm, just to get back to my bed late, late at night. A looong day. And there's nothing to eat the whole day but 'road food'. 

Even the freaking business lunch that I've been looking forward to is in a low rent cafeteria due to refurbishments at the client's site. 

I hold it together through the day, the occasional grumble silenced by fastidious willpower and an air of professional courtesy, but things are going badly for my guts by the time I'm waving goodbye and getting into the airport taxi. 

Now I'm used to taxis where you sit in the back separated by a screen, but this is more of a private hire situation, and I'm up at the front with the driver. I'm actually irritated that I'm still holding back this storm of gas that's been building through meeting after meeting with no opportunity for release, but for propriety's sake I don't let rip next to the poor cabbie.

Turns out manners are a one way street. We've been driving about five minutes, and this terrible smell hits my nose. The cabbie has ripped one, I can't believe it. 

My eyes are watering, and he just carries on talking about the weather like it hasn't even happened. I figure he's probably embarrased so I don't say anything. But a couple of minutes later, another one. Bam. It's fucking disgusting, I have to close my mouth because the air's thick enough you can basically taste it. But then I'm just breathing through my nose, which is helping nobody. It actually feels like it's burning me. My throat is closing up.

Above all, it seems so deeply unfair.  I'm here maintaining some class, holding back a fart that could jumpstart a second universe, but I'm still breathing the same shit-gas as if I wasn't, courtesy of my filthy cabbie.

I think, fuck it, if this guy goes in for round three I am releasing my demons and letting him take the blame. 

We're five minutes out, and he parks another air biscuit. Fuck you, I think, and I do the deed. 

It's perfectly executed. A silent release of a full day of pressure, every fart has been banked since 9am, and I'm cashing them all in with interest. It's a silent rush of hot air, compressed into ten seconds of pure release. I'm almost surprised you don't hear my rusty knothole slam shut when it finally ends. Mission accomplished. The perfect undercover fart.

I know what you're thinking. How did this go wrong? Didn't gamble and lose? Didn't let out a loud, incriminating trumpet? Didn't puke, or pee, knock his coffee into his lap or set off the passenger airbags? Nope. It all went according to plan. For a moment, I was proud of myself. 

Then the smell hits. I have fucking outdone myself. It's a devastating riposte to what has come before. It hits all the usual notes and adds a hint of burning rubber for effect. It's a spectacular crescendo of wrongful aromas. I can recognise every awful thing I've eaten all day in the mix. It's a fart so carefully matured it could have come with tasting notes, and they would have been one word in length: *Don't*.

Now let me tell you how this was a fuck up.

The electric window slowly slides down next to me, and the cold air hits my face. The cabbie turns to me, with actual tears in his eyes, and says:

""I am so, *so* sorry.""

""Uh... what for?"" I ask innocently.

""That fart,"" he replies eyes wide open, as if it should be obvious. ""I mean, Jeez, everybody farts, we're only human. But *that*... I'm just so sorry.""

He leaves the windows down all the way into the airport, and gives me a discount on the fare.

All the red-eye way home, all I can think is ""I stink so bad, I have made a cabbie apologise"".

EDIT: Thank you for the gift of gold!"
3g4dmv,non_TBI,"So, not today, but in early 2010 I was in the hospital for a few weeks with really bad pneumonia, I didn't realize how bad it was until the day I was discharged when the doctor told me they basically thought I was going to die every day I was there.

On my first day in the ICU, I received an emergency chest tube. Due to the severity of the situation, there was no time to prep, no time to put me under, no time to apply anesthetics. This was the most painful and scary moment of my entire life but that is a whole long story of it's own.

During my hospital stay, I underwent surgery where they cut into my lung to scrape all the fluid out ([called a thoracotomy: warning, gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy)) and was given 2 new chest tubes. Miraculously, I was discharged a week later with about 40-50 staples in my back and some **very** strong pain meds to be refilled every two weeks.

Two weeks later (just after getting a fresh bottle of pain meds), I went in for a check up with the doctor. He wanted me to pee in a cup so they could see if the medicine was having any effect on my liver. I peed in the cup and all was well.

Are you ready for the fuck up?

I woke up. 

The entire doctor's visit was a very vivid dream. What happened IRL was I got up in the middle of the night, opened my full bottle of pills, and peed in it. By the morning, it was just a sludge of pills that had dissolved into a chalky piss-sludge. I was devastated.

Because I had been given such a strong dose of a highly controlled pill, they could not give me another prescription, so I was stuck in horrible pain (while trying to catch up with my courses) until I could order my scheduled refill.

EDIT: forgot a "")'

EDIT 2 for those of you complaining there is no TL;DR: **TL;DR: Peed, shouldn't have**"
24zl1e,non_TBI,"Throwaway for this.  So I am a dispatcher for my town's police and fire departments and I worked an overtime shift last night from 1800-0600.  I usually work the swings so I was dead tired by 0530.  I was doing police dispatch and unusually, our department has the PD dispatchers pick up 911's as well as the calltakers (most dont).  For good reason.

At 0530, I was working a burglary in progress on the radio and without even thinking I picked up a 911.  I love answering the phones.  911 lines are my favorite.  Were, anyway.  

Long story short, I mistyped the address while trying to respond to my officers on the radio.  The call was for a 48 year old male, conscious and breathing but with chest pain.  4600 and 6400 on this street aren't too far from each other, but they are seperated by a river, so the fire crews had to go all the way south to the nearest bridge, head eat on the bridge then back north to the street and address.  

the delay was 14 minutes.  fourteen agonizing, awful minutes.  because after i called them back to get the correct address, they called back a minute later saying he was not conscious anymore.  And he died.  

Not sure how I feel right now, or if it even matters how I feel.  That guys family just lost him because of my human error.  my stupid fucking inattention to the most basic thing about my profession.  GET YOUR FUCKING ADDRESSES RIGHT.

So yeah, that's how I fucked up.  I am going to go get very, very drunk now."
3rra0w,non_TBI,"My sister-in-law is an absolute technophobe. She has always had some shit mobile phone but recently upgraded to an iPhone due to some pressure from her kids. She was having some problems with certain aspects of it, certain things draining her battery etc and asked me if I could have a look at it. So, me being the absolute evil genius that I am, entered a text shortcut so that when she typed the word 'Jay' (which is her husbands name) it would come up 'you're a fat bitch! Lol jk'. I know this is hardly an imaginative prank, and an infantile text, she would try and text her husband 'Hi Jay' and it would come up 'Hi you're a fat bitch! lol jk' which seemed like a pretty harmless joke that he wouldn't really be offended by. So I sit back to wait for the outcome.

Fast forward a couple of hours and I hear an ungodly hammering of my front door. I answer the door and she shoves past me, ""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY PHONE?!?!"" I am completely taken aback by how angry she is and was like ""Sorry Kelly, it was only a joke, was Jay pissed off?"" to which she replied ""I didn't fucking text Jay, my friend's mum had just died, I wrote to her on facebook to say 'So sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love Kelly and Jay'"" What she had actually written was ""So sorry for your loss, thinking of you, love Kelly and you're a fat bitch! lol jk""

3gfwdl,non_TBI,"This literally just happened in the last half hour and I'm still kind of in shock/ confused. So I've been chatting with this girl on Tinder for the past couple days and things were going well. Tonight she suggests that I come over to watch a movie and cuddle. I accept the invitation since all I was doing was watching the finale of True Detective and this season has been confusing enough. I make it to her apartment complex when suddenly my phone dies, that should have been the sign right there. I run to the gas station to buy a charger since I already drove out there and I'm committed to this cuddle. I get into her apartment and everything seems normal, we go strait to her room since her roommate (a dude) was in the shower right next to the living room. Not even a few minutes into the movie we start making out and it starts getting a little toasty. While were kissing she keeps getting texts and going out to talk to her roommate a couple times which I thought was odd. She comes back in and takes off my shirt and then says, ""I want you to fuck me right now"". It catches me off guard since I didn't take her for the type. I knew something was up at this point so I tell her that she was going a little fast for me. I hear the shower stop in the other room and then she says, ""do you mind if my roommate joins in?"" That isn't really what I had in mind and get up a little startled when suddenly roommate guy barges in balls naked and says, ""I'm going to pound you into the ground, I'm going to pound you into the fucking ground."" As he gazed into my eyes my dong went limp and I proceed to sprint out of the apartment as fast as I could with my shoes and shirt in one hand. As I'm running out he yells, ""I'm going to track you down, you better run I'm coming after you."" I didn't look back and ran as fast as I could to my car in shock and disbelief that something like that actually happened to me. Needless to say I'm going to take a break from Tinder for a little while.

Edit: I'm glad many of you are concerned about my wallet, it was in the car the entire time so its safe! As soon as I go to lunch I'm going to report her to Tinder and get her account banned. More importantly I will be filing a report with the police, I realize this could have gone way worse for me and I don't want anyone else walking into that situation if its a set up/ scam.

UPDATE: So as I was enjoying my Chick-fil-A at lunch I received a text from her, let me know what you think still seems kind of sketchy. ""I have no words to say how sorry I am about last night. That guy is an ex of mine and he kept threatening me until I came over and drank with him. he got me really drunk and got on my tinder and was actually texting you from his phone. He told me I couldn't go home until you came over and I convinced you to have a three some. Thank you for not taking advantage of me. I was scared shitless and I know he freaked you out too. I got your number from his phone after he passed out before I left so I could apologize. Again, so sorry that you were put in that situation."""
3gz3hc,non_TBI,"This didn't happen today, but over a couple weeks when I was going to boarding school 8 years back.

So I transferred in as a 10th grader from South Korea, into a 9th-12th boarding school in the US. 
Because it was a boarding school, I had a roommate, with whom I had only exchanged a couple emails before coming to the school.

The first day of school came, and I got to my room. The room had a bunk-bed, and having arrived first, I took the bottom bunk, and started unpacking.

Soon after, I heard a knock on the door. It was my roommate and his dad.
We exchanged greetings, and were busy unpacking, until it was time to go have lunch, meet new people, and do what high schoolers do on their first day of school.
The first day of school went by before I knew it, but I didn't really get to hang out with my roommate that much, as we were supposed mingle with everybody in our grade.
It was soon lights-out, so I climbed into my bottom bunk, and my roommate climbed up to his top bunk. We exchanged good-nights, and prepared for bed.

And then I started my daily 50 sit-ups.
*Huff-puff*, *Pant*, *Grunt*,
*Finish with an obligatory 'ahhh' from the burn*

I had been doing 50 sit-ups daily before going to bed for about a year then, and the first day of school was no reason to break my habit.
I was kind of afraid that I would wake my roommate, but he didn't say anything, and it sounded like he was asleep. So I thought nothing of it, and went to bed.

This goes on for a couple days, and one day my roommate carefully asks me without looking down from his bed, ""Umm...are you alright, bro?""
To which I respond while heavily breathing, ""Yeah!""-pant-""I'm fine. Just doing my daily routine, you know? - pant""
To this my roommate responds, ""Uh...s..sure..""

I shrug it off, and go to bed.

About a week later, in the middle of my sit-ups, I hear a creaking sound on top of my bed, and from my bottom bunk, I can see my roommate's hands and the top of his head slowly starting to surface from the edge of his bed.
He starts to peek down at my bed, but with eyes so white, that you'd think that he heard somebody get brutally murdered.

I casually continue my sit-ups as usual, and ask, ""What's"", pant, ""up?""

Suddenly, I see a wave of relief wash over his face. His expression rapidly changes from fear to realization, to relief, and then to laughter.

""OH MY GOD, YOU WERE DOING SIT-UPS. Oh, thank GOD!""
""What did you"", grunt, ""think I was doing?""
""I totally thought you were furiously jacking yourself off every single night before bed! I thought you would come up to my bed and rape me while I was asleep or something..I had been thinking that I was rooming with an Asian sexual deviant..""

And then it hit me. His previous comments. The dreadful silence every night.
My roommate acting strange around me.

For more than two weeks, my roommate had been thinking that my daily sit-ups had been daily me-time sessions, complete with my huffing and puffing, grunting, and ahhh's. For more than two weeks, my roommate had been laying awake on his top bunk, hearing me panting and grunting down on the lower bed, only imagining me getting myself off, not daring to look down for a fear of witnessing something unspeakable.

We had a great laugh, and we still talk about it every once in a while.

**tl;dr** - Went to boarding school, had a roommate with whom I shared a bunk-bed. I slept on the lower bed, he on the top bed. Every night, I did sit-ups before going to bed. For 2 weeks, my roommate thought that I had been furiously getting myself off.

**edit**: What, front-page? I will be enjoying my short-lived reddit fame. To answer some frequently asked questions:

* Yes, I know sit-ups aren't very effective, especially when done on a soft surface. I didn't know anything about fitness back then, and had mistakenly thought, 'Abs? Must do sit-ups, since I am moving my stomach!' I also progressively worked my way up to 50, from 10 a night. I also don't do any sit-ups now, in bed or on the floor.

* The bunk-beds at our school had enough space for sit-ups on the lower bed, but just barely.

3majd4,non_TBI,"I decided to make a quick run to the bank today to deposit a check. I arrived and pulled into a parking space and put my car in park.  I was looking down and reading a text on my phone when I suddenly noticed my car was rolling forward.  I switched into full panic mode.  The only thing separating me from the 40 mph traffic in front of me was a small patch of grass that I would be crossing at any moment now.  I started pumping my brakes to no avail and decided my best bet now would be to warn the oncoming traffic. So I laid on my horn and began wrestling to get my seat belt off so I could bail out if needed.  Keep in mind, because I am being descriptive, it may seem like a while had passed by now, but all of these thoughts and reactions happened within abut a 6 second span of time.  Suddenly, my car stopped rolling.  I looked up and around trying to figure out what had happened. I glanced at the bewildered drivers in the parked cars on either side of me that I had just rolled past. It was then that I realized that I had not left my parking spot.  The other two cars on either side of me had begun backing out at the same time, giving me the sensation that I was moving forward.  In other words, a parking lot full of people had just witnessed me pull into a parking spot and then suddenly have what must have seemed to be a complete meltdown; tearing at my seat belt and lying on my horn as I struggled to evade the jaws of death.  I decided it was best to leave and go the bank across town instead. "
2ekv1d,non_TBI,"This is a long story with a lot of details. So strap in, there's a nice payoff at the end. 

Like most TIFU, I was younger at the time, about 19 years old and was working at an Italian restaurant in the town that I live in. I live in a decently sized beach town that has no little to no crime and feels very much like a small town. 

The bosses at the restaurant I worked at were only a few years older than me and had hired me basically because I made them laugh during the interview. I realized this was important on my first day, because basically every other employee at the restaurant were girls. Hot ones. Like it's hard to concentrate on what you were doing hot. Of course my bosses did this so that they could hook up with them after work. And it worked. I regularly witnessed this process. So it was never surprising when one wouldn't show up and they'd hire another hot one sometime thereafter. I actually became numb to it. Instead of trying to act cool when a hot girl showed up for her first day, I was actually just cool about it. Because I was never the one getting laid. The bosses monopolized every chance that walked in through the front door. 

So when one day, a mid 30's supermodel faced Russian girl walked in the front door dressed like me, I didn't even flinch. She was without a doubt, the new hottest girl at the restaurant. But I was polite and said hi a couple times to her, but ultimately ignored her the first few weeks she worked with me. Mind you, the restaurant was always super busy and I knew that all these girls ended up hooking up with my wealthy, good looking bosses. I knew my chances were slim to none. Why bother even trying? 

After a few weeks of basically ignoring this girl, I realize that every day we work together, she basically starts to follow me around. If I'm at the bar, she's at the bar. If I'm at a break out back, she's on her break too. We start talking, and she's funny and I like listening to her. So eventually I start giving her rides home from work and picking her up when she needs it. And thus begins the framework for the most insane hookup night of my life. 

See, this girl didn't own her own car, but lived in a nice house with a roommate in a nice neighborhood. The same neighborhood as my wealthy bosses. My bosses actually had to pass her house on their way home from work. The neighborhood was within walking distance of work, which is why she started working there. So we start getting closer, but like the idiot that I am, I never even begin to think there is potential that I could hook up with her. I'm sure I am completely in the friend zone. And I didn't care. She's pretty and she's hanging around with me and I'm 19. She's 30 something. I feel special enough. 

I also don't think much of it either when I show up to work and start getting ribbed by one of my bosses about hanging out with her. He teased me in a fun way and I deny there being anything between us because there wasn't. But after a few days of this, I noticed the boss who primarily hooks up with the girls watching me a lot and not being so nice to me anymore. I'm young, but I immediately understand the problem I'm creating. He hires hot girls and then fucks them. That's the routine. I'm fucking up his routine. Hottest girl in the restaurant is hanging around me and not him. Being that I like my job, and make way more money than a 19 year old should, I really start pushing away from hot Russian girl. To the point of ignoring her. This was when I learned an early lesson about really hot girls. One you've probably heard before. Their entire adult life is riddled with guys who chase them, constantly pester them and never leave them alone. For a guy, any guy, to completely ignore them, is foreign to them. Paying them no attention will a lot of time actually make them go after you harder. Which is exactly what happened. 

So now it's becoming noticeable to me and everyone else we work with that this girl won't leave me alone. She begins to hang on me and tease me and do anything that will have me paying attention to her. On one side of the coin, it was awesome. On the other side, I could see my one bosses boiling rage that the younger funny guy he hired was beating him in the hot Russian girl game. And I wasn't just beating him, I was sweeping the series. Without so much as trying. 

So one weekend night I show up for work and as soon as I get inside, the boss who has begun to hate me calls me into the office. By the way, let's call hot, supermodel Russian girl ""Anna"". 

Boss: ""What's going on with Anna?""
Me: ""I don't know, did she not show up?""
Boss: ""No, I mean with you and her. You guys fucking?""

So I'm young and smart, and know when I shouldn't let people walk over me or intimidate me. I want to keep my job, but I won't be a bitch about things either. So smiling I say, ""I'm not sure if that's any of your business.""

Big mistake. The mistake that starts it all. Because he slams the paper's he working on down hard on the table. He turns around in his chair and says, ""Do you like your job? Do you want to keep it?"" He knows the answer, so I just stare at him. ""Well then stop seeing Anna. Stop picking her up, stop hanging with her every second that you are here. Stop allowing her to hang on you. Or I'll fire you."" Immediately I understand the depth of how much he is into this girl and he's willing to fire me over it to get his way. And so I agree. I make the decision right then and there, that I'll keep away from her. Like I said, I have little to no chance anyway, and I'm making great money. Whatever. 

The night begins to wind down and I decide to go take a break out back. I've been ignoring Anna all night and my boss is now thoroughly pleased with me. His master scheme has worked and he can get back to trying to fuck the hottest waitress in the restaurant. So I'm sitting out back, not even thinking about the situation when Anna busts out the back door and slams it shut behind her. She's evidently pissed. She walks right up to me and doesn't fuck around with what's on her mind. 

Anna: ""Are you mad at me?""

Me: ""No, look Anna, I like you. You're great. But us being friends is making shit uncomfortable with the bosses and I. They're getting pissed at me.""

Anna: ""Because (shitty boss) wants to fuck me?""

Me: Yes, because (shitty boss) wants to fuck you.""

Anna: ""Do you want to fuck me?""

This is the part in the movie where the record would scratch, and then the main character laughs uncomfortably, completely at a loss for words. 

Me: ""Um, uh... look, you're beautiful. No guy who sees you isn't attracted to you.""

Anna: ""I asked if you wanted to fuck me?""

Me: ""Yeah. I would fuck you."" 

Anna: ""Good, then when we got off work tonight, take me back to my place and fuck me."" 

And with that she walks off and back into the restaurant. I sit there stunned, in a haze. I'm pretty sure she's serious. I'm terrified. My life up until this point has been awful drunken hookups with high school girls at parties. I literally can't think. But I'm in. I'm solidly fucking in. Fuck my boss. This is worth losing my job over. 

So we wrap up work and she jumps in my car and we speed off. It's only when I pull up to her house, do I remember, shit... my boss lives in this neighborhood. I'm pretty sure he has to pass right down this road when he goes home. This must be how he has figured out she and I had been hanging out so much. I can't leave my car in the driveway. He'll see it. So she comes up with an idea I can't disagree with. There's a doctors office in a business complex right across the street. I can park there and just run back over. It's perfect. 

So I get back to her house, and walk in her front door and walk to her room, and she's standing in her underwear. It goes without saying that it's a memory burned into my mind. She takes my hand, sits me down on her bed and what follows is exactly what a 19 year old kid dreams of. So it's about 30 minutes later and the room is darkly lit and I'm praying to every major deity and thanking them that I haven't finished too quickly, because I want this moment to last forever. She's on top of me, and time is in slow motion. It's the greatest moment of my life at that point. Which is why it took me a few seconds to realize I'm seeing flashlights on her ceiling. I'm also seeing flashlights underneath her door to her room. She notices them first. Then I'm snapped back to reality. She starts to freak out. It's obviously flashlights. Pouring into her house. 

Being that I was the guy, and the guy is always supposed to protect the girl, I run naked to one of the windows. I look outside to see (and I'm not exaggerating here) 10 to 12 police cars with their lights on. In my peripheral I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. Slowly approaching is 5 officers dressed completely in SWAT gear. My only rational thought is that I'm watching all this and I'm naked. I no longer have an erection. I grab my boxers, throw them on and go to run back to the window. They're at this house, but this can't be for us. I'm confused. 

From outside, a man yells, ""(Town I live in) Police! Open the front door immediately! The house is surrounded! We have a K-9 Unit! We will send him in if you don't comply!"" I don't even think. I'm not a guy who gets in trouble a lot and have police officers in my family. The police tells you to do something, you do it. End of discussion. So I run to the front door, I swing it open and am staring at about 20 officers. SWAT included. Now my erection is inside me. I put my hands up, and go to speak when a hand comes out of nowhere and whips me to the ground. In my underwear. And it's raining. I land in a puddle. Hard. I hear hot Russian girl scream. The police rush past and enter the house. What the fuck is happening? I now have a vagina. 

I'm cuffed, there's dog's barking. A knee crushes into my neck and I'm throw into the back of a car while I'm asking what is happening. A few minutes pass and I turn to see hot Russian girl's roommate and hot Russian girl in my t-shirt and a towel talking to police. They're both cuffed. I'm sitting the back of the squad car for about a minute when I glance across the street and see 3 more police cars parked next to my Jeep. Where I had parked in the business complex. That perfect parking spot to hide from my boss. Then it dawns on me. It wasn't a perfect spot. Because it was well passed midnight. We work at a restaurant that doesn't get out till late. So I parked my car in an empty business parking lot, late at night, got out and ran around the side of the building. Mind you, I'm dressed in black from my job. Late at night, dressed in black, running around the side of a closed building. That probably looked pretty suspicious to the elderly security guard who patrolled the complex at night. 

So he made a call to the sheriff. So I know you're thinking at this point, well there's no way this many officers, let alone SWAT would show up for this. But they did. And here's why. The security guard went to the building to play police officer while waiting for the cops to arrive. He got out his flashlight and went searching apparently from building to building looking into windows. He at one point climbed up on a bench and looked inside a window and slipped and his flashlight crashed into and through a window. So now the alarms have gone off. When the police finally show up, he completely neglects to mention, he's the one who set off the alarm. Being that he's old, I've kind of forgiven him since then. So when the cops go searching the buildings they not only find a broken window, but know someone has attempted to get inside. Obviously. But they can't find me. Because I'm across the street having the greatest night of my life. So they call the K-9 Unit for a search. Which just so happens to be doing a late night training operation with the local SWAT team. What better way to train, then to do a real world exercise with someone breaking and entering. 

But it gets better. Her roommate drove a really nice car. An older Mercedes. A Mercedes that had just recently been in a minor car accident the week before. Damage right to the driver side of her car. Not major, but a nice little dent. So when the K-9 sniffs and tracks me passed the building, right up to the house I'm in, (yeah the dogs noses are that good) they now see a car that looks like it has been kicked in and house with basically no lights on in it. They treat the situation as if I could be running and trying to get away from them. Which gets us back to where I'm at. Soaked, in my underwear, in the back of a squad car. 

Now I know this has been a long story, and if you've stuck with it, the payoff is coming right now. And it's an amazing payoff. 

When I'm pulled out of the car, I explain the same story to them that hot Russian girl has told them: my boss told me to stay away and so I parked my car across the street to get laid. Basically word for word. The look they all give each other was priceless. I'll cherish that look forever. But, they now realize they have fucked up majorly but don't want to admit it just yet. There's about 10 cops standing around me outside of the car. 

SWAT guy: ""How'd the window get broken?""

Me: ""I don't know, I didn't touch anything. I just ran around the side to her house.""

Officer: ""The security guard just told us he accidentally broke it, he didn't tell us that earlier.""

SWAT guy: ""So you're over here, kinda hooking up?""

Me: ""Yes sir. We work together. We just got off work. That's why I just parked there.""

SWAT guy #2: ""She's like in her 30's. You look about 16.""

Me: ""I'm 19. But yeah, she's older than me.""

SWAT guy: ""Wow."" 

A couple chuckles. Then silence. 

SWAT guy: ""Seriously... good for you man. I'm amazed. You're on another level then I was at your age."" 

They then begin to apologize and begin to say things like ""You understand we were just doing our jobs, we didn't know what was actually happening. You could have been dangerous"" etc. etc. 

So I tell them not to worry and that I have police family members and completely understand. I won't be suing them or filing reports or anything. I just want the cuffs off. So they continue to be extra nice as they turn me around to take my cuffs off. So the payoff I've been talking about... the amazing kicker to the whole story. When they turn me around, I'm now facing back out across the street, in my underwear with the cuffs still on, and I see both my bosses pulled over on the side of the road, sitting on the side of their car, watching the whole thing. How long they have been there, I don't know. There were so many cop cars in the street they had to stop and wait. 

I was fired coincidentally within a few weeks. "
3i31v2,non_TBI,"Last week I went for a walk in the forest. The next day, when I was in bed, my legs started itching. I turned on the light and discovered two tiny little fucking disgusting ticks just chilling there, trying to deprive me of blood that I would prefer to keep myself. I felt a bit panicky, because of Lyme disease. To prevent getting this disease it is important to removes the ticks ASAP, preferably within twenty-four hours. My walk was twenty-six hours ago. I removed the ticks and proceeded to check the rest of my body for ticks. I got a bit paranoid and started to feel an itch in my butt crack. I discovered it is very hard to examine your own butt crack. (LPT: put mirror on laundry basket, squat over it, shine with torch in the area of darkness…) I then saw a black blob about 2 mm in diameter next to my b-hole. Shit, a tick that sucked itself full of blood in an area that I couldn’t quite reach. I proceeded to panic, because I wanted this fucker out of my body. Even though I felt embarrassed to the max, I decided it was essential to wake up my mum so she could help me. An awkward wake-up session later and my grumpy mum is bending over my ass to remove from there: a piece of dried-up poo. 

TL; DR my mom discovered I don’t wipe properly. 

Edit: Peeps are saying it's nonsense that I can't reach my ass. True, I can reach but not with the precision needed to take out a tick. It has to be done in a certain way, so the head is not left behind...

Edit2: Thanks for all the butt wiping tips. Also it seems removing the head matters less then I thought. TIL"
3qeqz6,non_TBI,"So, I've been missing my leg for four years now. I've adapted quite well. I get around just fine with a prosthetic.

However, when I'm at home in my small apartment, I prefer to crawl short distances instead of going through the hassle of putting my prosthetic on. It's jut more convenient that way.

So last night we had some company over to watch scary movies, and I read everyone a few short submissions to /r/nosleep. Everyone was pretty spooked before we went to bed. Two friends of mine slept on the couch, and one of them was someone we have never had over before. So this individual had never seen me crawl without my leg on. To describe it, I kind of move like a very slow cheetah who's missing a hind leg. Like a tri-pod crawl, if that makes sense. So, I suppose it can be unsettling if you're not expecting it. 

In the middle of the night/early morning, I decide to leave my room for a drink. I didn't turn the hall light on so I wouldn't disturb my sleeping guests. There's just enough light coming from the light above the sink to guide me where I needed to go. As I'm turning the corner to enter the kitchen, I see a figure and I hear ""OH SHIT WHAT THE FUCK"", next thing I know, I'm getting kicked in the face. 
I suppose my friend recognized my foul mouth screaming back at him, because then he turned the light on and started apologizing profusely. 

TL;DR: I crawled through my apartment without my prosthetic leg, my friend thought I was a demon and started kicking me in the face.  


EDIT: A lot of people are asking why I don't just hop. Well, in the accident that took my leg, I also maintained compound fractures in all the long bones in my remaining leg, causing the my femur, tibia, and fibula too all be replaced by titanium rods. Hopping on such a leg causes too much stress and pain to my remaining knee cap. 
Even without those injuries though, it's usually not recommended for any amputee to hop as a frequent mode of transport, even for short distances. "
3y6671,non_TBI,I dropped a kid on the [floor.](https://i.imgur.com/uwO4gIE.jpg)
2txjm0,non_TBI,"Today I fucked up. There's a girl in my Ecology class. Let's call her ""Madge"". Madge is your go-getting try-hard holier-than-thou know-it-all with an unchanging facial expression I can only describe as ""cat trying to shit a peach pit"". One of those constant-frowners, and constant-downers. 

I even tried to get along with Madge at the start; I'd sit by her and try to engage her (read: humor her) with conversations in relevant topics about Ecology, such as the thrilling handedness of apes or edge-of-your-seat songbird plumage complexity, but just trying to be civil was a futile endeavour. Expecting Madge to be civil with you because you were civil with her is like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn't eat it. Madge was born to be an asshole.

Everything you said to her was met with a ""Pffft"", or a dramatic roll of the eyes, and a quick retort such as ""Well, if you'd actually *read* Carter et al. 2007, you would have known that..."" She had to be better and smarter than everyone, at everything, all the time. And boy, that shit got real old, real quick. So I stopped sitting by her. And began to loathe her. With a pre-occupied disposition. I thought about her twice today before even writing this, that's how much I don't like her.

Fast forward to the first Capture the Flag game of the year. Being a Freshman, I thought I'd attend as a way to get out of my residence room and meet some people. The first game was at about 8:00PM, the campus was already dark, and I showed up just wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Out of 150+ people (who knew Capture the Flag was so popular?) I ended up being possibly the most under-dressed person there. Camouflage, Ghillie suits, face-paint, and black morph costumes were just some of the norm. This was like Capture the Flag Olympics. 

Teams were divided into short sleeve vs. long sleeve, and the ""flags"" were two bicycle lights. I began to mingle with fellow short-sleeves... and that's when I saw her. Madge. Black boots, black pants, black turtleneck, black scarf, black cap, black gloves. She was going all Call of Duty for this game -- of course. Why wouldn't she be a try-hard at Capture the Flag too? And I just knew I'd have to tag her the fuck out. This was my chance to prove I was better at something.

The first few rounds, us short-sleeves did terribly because no one stayed behind to defend, so we lost 3 rounds promptly. Each time they blew the whistle, I could hear Madge laughing. I could hear it. So I switched to defense. To prevent ""camping"", there was a 50 meter buffer around each ""flag"". Conveniently for me, there was a group of hedges 50 meters away from my flag. So I hid in the hedges.

Each time anyone from the other team tried to sneak up to our flag, I'd jump out of the hedges, startle the hell out of them, and that would give me the time I needed to run up and tag them out. I'd probably tagged out 8-10 people in about 15 minutes, when the stars aligned, and I saw her. Madge. Walking through the shadows along the side of a building, headed straight for our flag, thinking she was so sneaky with all her matching black gear. This was it. It was *my time to shine*.

But I was too excitable. I bounded from the hedges like Sea Biscuit while she was still a good 40-50 feet away. So I yelled ""AAAaarrgh!"" to try to emphasize the startling effect. She shrieked in surprise, but without missing a beat, she spun around 180 degrees and headed back for her ""side"" at a dead sprint. I then realized that if she got to her side before I caught her, she'd be ""out of play"" and I couldn't tag her out -- that was an impossible embarrassment, I couldn't allow it. I took off too, at a dead sprint. Like Gimli, I'm not so much for long runs, but dangerous across short distances. I was gaining on her, and now confidently puffed up, with a laugh I shouted ""YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED!""

The chase lasted probably 100-150 feet before she tripped on a tree root and fell pretty hard, but made no attempt to get back up. As I got closer, I realized she had stooped to a whole new low - playing the crying game, surely exaggerating an injury that would thus make my ""tagging"" of her distasteful. But then as I got closer still, I realized she was *really* crying, like *hysterically* crying. I was still mad, so as I got up to her I said ""Crying won't fucking help"", at which point she rolled on to her back and looked up at me and shouted ""GET THE FUCK AWAY!"". I leaned down to make eye contact and said ""it's just a fucking game"", to which she cocked an eyebrow and said ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!""

And then it hit me.

I did not recognize this girl.

*This was not Madge.*

This was some girl walking to the bus station after a night class.

Horrified, mouth hanging open, the rolodex of my mind spun as I suddenly imagined what it must have been like from her perspective: a large, strange, bearded, sweaty, under-dressed man jumped out of the bushes screaming ""AAARRRRrrrgh!"", and when she ran, he ran too, screaming ""YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE TIRED"", and when he saw her crying, said ""Crying won't fucking help"".

I wanted to apologize, I wanted to introduce myself, I wanted to explain, but all I could get out was ""Hey... sorry -- it was, it's just... Hi, I'm... Hey, you know, Capture the Flag?... PLEASE DON'T CALL THE POLICE, THIS WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING"" and then I ran away hoping she hadn't seen enough of my face to create a composite sketch for Campus Security.

I never ended up tagging her, or Madge for that matter, and I never went back to Capture the Flag after that (I hear it may be getting cancelled) but I probably caused some seriously deep-seated anxieties about night classes that will haunt that poor girl forever.

Dear night class girl, if you're a Redditor, I am so sorry. I'm actually a pretty nice guy, really.

TL;DR - Today I fucked up by wanting to get back at a snooty know-it-all from Ecology class by chasing her down at a night game of Capture The Flag only to realize I'd chased down (and probably subsequently scarred) some girl from night class who wasn't even playing.

**EDIT:** Wow, thanks for the Reddit gold, guys - I'd say ""you surprised me and popped my gold cherry"" but that expression would seem to be in poor taste after my story. 

**EDIT:** I never realized how much I made it sound like she broke her neck at first. Holy shit. Also, I laughed my ass off at how many people say there's sexual tension between me and Madge. Fucking Madge.      ... But maybe there is tension. Maybe I am in love with her... holy shit MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE! Jk lol I really still hate her. "
35xrrx,non_TBI,"Greatest/worst thing ever just happened to me, so buckle up folks..it's story time:




Girl on a dating app tells me in the first few messages that I'm really cute (true) and interesting (also true) and asks me to meet her at 1140am for coffee at a random McDonald's. When I ask if she's a 45 year old man trying to harvest my organs, she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they're straight from Facebook. Because that's how you convince somebody you're real (not true).




Now normally I don't accept propositions like this because I'm thinking ""what's the catch?"" Well, I decide to live a little on the YOLO side...and since it's right next to a Subway Sandwich shop I think that the worst that could happen is it's a 45 year old lonely man, I give him a big hug because I know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man, get a tasty sandwich, then go home. Apparently that was NOT the worst thing that could happen.




I show up. She shows up. She's real. I'm surprised. I buy her coffee because I subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise. She uses her McCafe frequent buyers card so she gets stamps. Its cute. While the guy is making her drink, she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun. I go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because I'm a romantic at heart. 5 minutes later. 10 minutes later. 15 minutes later. No girl. I text her the typical guy message ""lol u get lost???"". No response. Turns out she took the coffee and left.




So I'm not saying it's bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or aren't attracted to them. It's totally your decision. But I don't think that's the case...I think this girl is a serial McCafe dater. And I don't think this was her first time. It was too professional. Too clean. It was the perfect McHeist. And I'm starting to think I'm not even mad...she didn't steal my credit card, or my organs. Just a few euros.




And my heart.

3ro52v,non_TBI,"Today I had a phone interview with Chevron for a chemist position. The interview began with usual pleasantries and they asked how I was. I'm from Boston, and as any of you Bostonians know the weather here is currently exceptional. So I responded ""It's 70 and sunny in Boston in November, so I certainly can't complain."" They chuckled at my line, so I went full steam ahead with the career-ruining followup:

""Haha, you guys at Chevron keep up the good work with this global warming!""

Silence on the other end for 5 solid seconds.

Needless to say I probably won't be getting a call back."
3ex772,non_TBI,"Actually, I was the interviewer.  Although the main interview and hiring is done by someone else, they are sent to me for 10-15 minutes at the end since I'm the person they will directly be interfacing with.  I always get a print out of their resume beforehand which I glance at during the interview..  

Well today I had an interview and it went fine.  At the end we got up and I told the woman that it was nice to meet her and we'd let her know.  But, since the resume has absolutely no future use to me, I was absentmindedly ripping it up and throwing it in the trash in front of her as I said this.  The look of horror on her face was tangible.  It was only about 15 seconds after she walked out the door that I realized what I had done and how soul-crushing it must have felt!

So to poor interview woman I say now:  ""Sorry!  You were actually a decent candidate!""

3thwet,non_TBI,"This happened about 3 hours ago... Be me, 29 years old male, living in probably the most corrupted country in the world (Venezuela).  So just to give you some background, Venezuela is in a very difficult situation, political and economical,  the majority of us want to get rid of this corrupted government and we have elections in a fee days so tension is palpable in the streets, police and military are corrupted as fuck (you can buy weapons such as grenades or sub machine guns to them,  etc etc) basically hate is in the air. So, I was in a traffic jam, one of the many we have daily when the hunger hit me, I had a big bag of Doritos in my car so I decided to eat, I have a gastric bypass and can't eat that much, I was eating with my window open when a motorcycle with 2 military officers (low rank) stand beside me waiting for their turn to pass, I see the guy in the back literally drooling looking at the Doritos so ""why not? I won't eat this much"" I offer him the bag and he didn't hesitate to take it with a very big smile and thanking me.... 20 seconds later the shit storm!!!! The driver next to me gets out of his car screaming ""you fu*king thieves! Let the guy alone he have done nothing to you""  (he thought I was being black mailed and I got asked for money inside the bag wich is one of many ways for them to get paid black mailing you),  I get out of the car to explain that it wasn't money but hell no,  the military officer that was driving told me in not a such a pleasant way to stay inside the car that he could handle it....  He gets down the bike and goes to the guy that was screaming baton in hand when all of a sudden no less than 20 people are surrounding him screaming ""thief!!!! Oppressor!!! Go to hell""  and start punching him. Military #2 gets downy to help his friend and getting punched and screamed he managed to get military #1 in the bike and proceed to drive as fast as he could... Everyone get to their cars and guy #1 gets to me Doritos in hand ""here's your money"".....  Now I have back my Doritos in my car and sadness in my heart for how deep this society has fallen... 


But I have half a bag of Doritos to eat in the traffic jam tomorrow and I have that going for me wich is nice. 

TL;DR: 2 military officers got their ass kicked for a bag of Doritos I gift them.

2bvezf,non_TBI,"About 10 years ago in my horny teen boy years (14-16) I used to go online to chatrooms or webcam sites to get off. I was also bi-curious and talked to other boys and probably men. I decided to record some videos of myself and send them to people online. My parents just got a new video camera and gave me their old one. It was one of those pre-digital, cassette tape kinds. So I took all these very raunchy videos of myself, jerking myself off, spreading my ass, cumming onto myself, putting things up my butt etc. It was after that I realized I had no idea how to upload the film onto my computer. So I just forgot about it. Years passed, I went to college, moved away, became a normal adult, etc. 

This weekend I've been at my parents house for a family gathering including aunts/uncles/grandparents. Yesterday after dinner I was out in the yard playing soccer with my younger cousins while most of the adults were inside watching old family videos...... After a couple hours I go inside into the living room and see my uncle has rigged up that old cassette camcorder to the TV. Immediately my memory is flooded with my nasty antics, my heart hits 200 bpm. My mom must have dug it up when I moved out and saved it. I quickly look at the screen. It's my sisters high school basketball game. I try to remember if I destroyed the tape. I must have. How could I not? The basketball game cuts to a family vacation to a lava flow field. My dad making goofy faces and me being a moody twat. I cringe at my too-cool-for-this behavior. Uncle presses fast-forward, blurs of black-gray rock formations fly past, then abruptly transitions into a fleshy mass of humiliation. It's hard to make out what's going on but I know instantly. My uncle presses play; I die inside. There I am, laid on my back, legs raised up against a table, pointing my underage dick at my face beating off and moaning. ""Oh goodness"" said grandma. ""What the fuck"" said everyone else. I put my hands up to my face and wished that an asteroid would hit right where I'm standing. "
3gtuve,non_TBI,"I just witnessed/accidentally participated in one of the worst public break-ups I've ever seen in my life. *(About 3 hours ago now - this is a copy of my direct post to Facebook upon occurrence)*. 

There's a couple standing in front of me on the tram [Melbourne trams = endless, *endless* entertainment], when the bloke receives a text message and his lady just happens to see who it's from (no matter that he tried to frantically hide it from her view - we are woman/we are eagle.)

She IMMEDIATELY starts screaming at him and slapping his business suit and going on about **""HOW FUCKING DARE YOU""** and all that. 

The tram stops.

She rips off her engagement ring, storms off the tram, and throws the ring back at him....which I inadvertently/instinctually catch **on the full**. 

With one final ""**FUCK YOU TO HELL!""** - the doors closed and it was just me and him standing there in silence for like a solid minute. 

Me: ""Uhh...do you want this? *Orrrrrr*...?""

Handing back that goddamned ring in front of all those people watching was one of the most awkward things I have ever had to do IN MY LIFE.

Cheers for the read, guys! I'll get on replying to you all while pretending to work at the office today (props for the excuse to not work on a Friday as well)"
3kzt6b,non_TBI,"My roommate goes shopping on Sunday evenings. He bought a carton of eggs. Last night after shopping he went out, and I knew he'd probably not be back that night.

So I decided to scramble every egg from the carton. I ate some of them (It was always my intention to replace the egg carton, just to get that out of the way), and the rest I stuffed the scrambled egg back into the carton. So it was just a carton of scrambled egg. 

Then on the back of the carton I wrote ""Pre Scrambled"" in marker. 

This morning I hear my roommate exclaim ""What the fuck!?"" 

I ran into the kitchen and saw him staring dumbfounded at the carton. He kept looking from me to the carton and back. ""Did you buy the Pre-Scrambled kind?"" I asked. 

He looked at me like I had just spoken Saturnian, so I repeated my question. ""The fuck do you mean?"" he replied. 

I took the carton from him, acted like I was carefully examining the packaging, and then pointed out the writing on the back. Pre-Scrambled. ""Yeah, you bought Pre-Scrambled Eggs,"" I said. 

He looked as perplexed as it is possible for a person to be. Maximum perplexness. 

I put on an act of being amazed that he had never heard of Pre-Scrambled eggs, and about how I always check the back of the carton to make sure they aren't Pre-Scrambled. 

He stammered something along the lines of ""But what...but why...how...why would they...what the...why..."" 

I was about to reveal it was a prank when he suddenly got very serious and intense, like a late-season Walter White sort of vibe, and he said ""Fuck no. Not my eggs."" Then he wheeled around and marched out of the apartment. Out to his car. And he left. 

I was a bit concerned. And probably should have shouted after him before he left. But I didn't. 

So like 40 minutes pass and I hear our apartment door open, and I hear ""I'm banned! I'm banned from the Stop & Shop! Banned!"" 

I walk out to the kitchen with some apprehension. He looks enraged. ""Banned!"" He dropped the egg carton on the floor. ""Did you fuck me!?""

He wasn't taking it well. 

""They don't fuckin sell this shit!!! Did you fuck me!?"" 

At this point I admitted to pranking him. And I apologized. He just stared at me for a moment, then shouted something like ""You're buying me fucking new eggs!!"" Then he slammed his bedroom door. Then he opened it and yelled ""I have to drive to motherfucking PATHMARK, are you kidding me!? You go too far!! FUCK!!!"" And slammed the door again. Then he opened it again and shouted ""STOP LAUGHING!!!"" and slammed the door again. 

I do feel bad about this because it was never the intention of the prank to get him banned from the supermarket. I have already replaced his eggs and I am in the process of thinking up some way to make it up to him regarding his banishment. 

TL;DR - Accidentally got my roommate banned from the supermarket when I convinced him they sold him ""Pre-Scrambled"" eggs. "

Now I am currently stuck in her room trying to be as quite as possible. My girlfriend left to work already and I have work in less than 3 hours. I can't sneak out because her bedroom is upstairs and he is downstairs working on shit on the computer. I will update you guys as soon as I'm out of here. Hopefully it's soon

Edit: I've been stuck for over an hour now. No signs of him leaving. My back is starting to cramp up from not moving. Less than 2 hours until I have to be at work

Edit 2: since so many of you keep telling me to jump out the window. I was considering it but realistically there is no way I could go through the whole thing without making a lot of noise. http://imgur.com/G59DaVB
the layout of the house is pretty much the same as the one across. I would the window on the second floor is what we are looking at. I'm starting to consider calling work saying I might be late but I'm going to wait a little more. Less than 1.5 hrs till work

Final update: FRONT PAGE!? thanks everyone!
Damn.. a lot of you guys really wanted me to get caught. Thanks for all the suggestions and advice! I ended up waiting It out. The dad ended up taking a shower and I thought that would have been my chance but I started to think about how I sometimes leave the water running to warm up before jumping in. I didnt want to die today so I waited again. Finally he left just on time for me to run home and leave for work.  but seriously? You guys wanted me to kill him, tie myself up and pretend to be kidnapped, someone suggested making out with the mother? Idk how that would help. I didnt do no ninja jump off the second story. If he hadn't left by a certain time,  I would have been ready to take u/PierceTheProper advice and done the whole pizza deal. Lucky for me I didn't have to take things to that level.

3gach5,non_TBI,"This happened a couple weeks ago. I’m using a throwaway because I don’t want this shit tied to my main account. I’ll try to make this as short as possible. 

**Additional warning**: *I’m in my early twenties and not that experienced when it comes to sexy times. All the porn in the world couldn’t have prepared me for this.*

I was going out with a girl for about 6 months. It was nice. She was freaky. I liked it. She kept hinting towards butt stuff which I’ve never done. I was skeptical, but after talking to my friends about it, they encouraged me to give it a shot and to be ""open minded.""

We’re driving one day listening to music and some song comes on and one of the lyrics were “you gotta eat the booty like groceries.” I’ll never forget this fucking song. The GF knows the song and she’s singing the lyrics and she’s looking directly at me while singing that line. Subliminal message.

Fast forward a couple days and she’s over at my place taking a shower, getting ready for work. I join. Sexy time. “Be open minded” rang through my mind. So I decided to try something new. I tried to eat the booty. I even went as far as to stick my tongue in her butt. I heard a “oh” and then the worst shit **ever** happened. She farted. I jerk back. Mind you, we’re still in the shower so I’m thinking the water mixed with the fart and I have nasty fart water in my mouth. No.

I spit the water out and it’s not just water. She pooped in my mouth. It wasn’t a lot, but that’s no excuse.

She started apologizing, but her sorrow turned into straight laughter. She wouldn’t stop laughing. I was so angry I didn’t know what to do.

TL;DR: I tried to eat the booty like groceries. It didn’t work. "
26zn4l,non_TBI,"Today my wife decided that it would be a nice idea to take a shower together. We do it all of the time and it is a nice way to kick start our night together after work. 

It was a typical shower which consists of her using all of the water with me being left in the cold waiting for my turn in the warm water.

After a while she decided to forfeit the water and let me have my turn. I grabbed my body wash off the shelf and proceeded to drop it. This is where I fucked up.

I quickly bent down to grab it. I bent at the knees remembering that it's bad for you to bend down to grab something only using your waist. 

I was soon met with a painful sensation that I had never experienced before. The small push/ pull valve that changes the water from the faucet to the shower head penetrated my virgin ass. 

The pain was unreal. The water changed from the shower head to the faucet. I shot up trying to get away from the metal knob that just violated me. Upon standing up the shower resumed. 

I stood there in shock looking up at my wife. She witnessed the entire thing. She won't stop laughing at me about it. It hurts to sit.

TL;DR: Showered with my wife trying to put something in her. Ended up with something in me.

Edit: Wording. 

It figures that my most successful post to date is about something metal entering my ass.


The Steve Byrne video: I have not seen it, I swear that this is true. I'm going to watch it with my wife tonight because if it is verbatim like some of you say she will get a good laugh from it."
2dz7by,non_TBI,"My girlfriend has been on holidays for the last couple of weeks. It kinda sucked because it was our five month anniversary (which she took quite seriously). So we were texting and things started getting suggestive (or at least I think they were) and then she sends a message saying ""hey babe skype me I have a surprise for you!"" We have done skype sexy time before and that's where I thought this was leading. So I flopped it out and skyped her my erect penis taking up the entire screen. Then when she answered it was her entire family: mum, dad and two little sisters (7&9) there yelling in unison ""happy anniversary"" I freaked out and slammed the laptop shut. I since have received two messages from my girlfriend (soon to be ex I imagine) saying ""what the fuck was that?!!"" And ""ANSWER ME!!""

It is the a definite dumbest thing I've ever done. I kinda wanna die right now.

Edit: I know it's kinda weird that we celebrate each month but yeah I guess we're pretty young. Five months is pretty long for high school couples so yeah. 

I still haven't heard anything from her except another text just saying ""?"" I don't have the balls to reply.

UPDATE: So I decided to man up and text her back, it was the most awkward conversation ever! But it ended with her saying ""maybe we should take a break when I get back"" I should change the title to ""TIFU by showing my erect penis to my ex-girlfriends entire family.

"
38ut4u,non_TBI,"I downloaded it for him and put it on a USB so he could watch it when he had some downtime. So he watched it tonight and when I got back in, I asked him what he thought. 

""Really good, but quite confusing at times though, took quite a bit of effort to understand the direction but it wasn't impossible""

I knew something wasn't quite right. My dad is an intelligent man - he should be understanding this film with no problems whatsoever. I projected my disbelief to him - 

""The plot is good, it's a good film! I don't know how that wasn't apparent to you?!""

He replied: ""It was just quite unclear at times with the dialogue, the script was definitely lacking, which was a shame because it could have been really good!""

I was still heavily confused - most people who have seen this film would agree it's engaging and exciting. I could not see what the problem was. 

I took the USB stick back and plugged it into my laptop and I decided to watch it again for the hell of it. 

Then I realised.

The download didn't have hardcoded subtitles. 

**The man literally sat there watching apes grunt at eachother for the best part of 2 hours without a fucking clue what they were saying.** 

Sorry Dad!"
3a3768,non_TBI,"So this didn't happen today but happened earlier this year.

I was due to attend a university for a guided tour and interview and we were allowed to bring a guest with us. I decided to bring my dad because he's a fun guy to make the trip with and thought he might be interested in looking around.

So I'm filling out all the details on the online booking form and it asks ""Who will be attending with you?"". Now here's the fuckup, rather than typing in my dad's name, I enter "" My Father"". Clearly I was thinking a tad too literally.

So I forget about this for a few weeks and we finally end up going. When we get there, they are calling out names and handing out visitor badges in pairs, one for prospective students and one for their guests. I receive my pair of badges, one with my name on and the other simply with the words ""My Father"" on. I show my dad, hoping he'll laugh it off and I can go explain and get a different name badge but instead he insists on wearing the badge all day, kindly explaining to everyone how stupid I was."
2w54su,non_TBI,"So this happend about a year ago but I felt like it would fit well here. 

My very good friend that I attened elementary school and high school that we'll name ""Levi"" was home for the weekend and I hadn't seen him in about 8 months since he had been deployed to Iraq for his second time since joing the US army in 2011. 

Levi and I have always been close and for second we even considered being a couple (I am a female) but it just never worked out. But I wrote him letters all through his basic training and when he got deployed all through his first 6 months of that as well. 

He is an field artillary man and from our letters back and forth I could tell that he was seeing some things over there but he never went too much into detail besides saying how bored he was and how nice the villagers were near his camp. 

So anyways he gets back home and of course we all (other friends of ours) decide to go out and celebrate! 

Levi and I have always been pretty heavy drinkers around each other. We always encourage each other to get way way way too intoxicated but for the most part it's all been fun and games.
So same thing tonight. We're challanging each other to chug beer after beer, and to attempt the line of shots call the ""Three Wisemen""...... Needless to say I puked all over the bar floor and we were asked kindly to leave the establishment. 


So our group of friends are trying to walk to the bus stop and catch a ride home. I am walking with our good friend Kendra borrowing a cigarette as Levi is stumbling a few feet ahead of us. Basically all I remember next is thinking to my drunken self how happy I am to see Levi again and how much I missed him. I remember getting this bright idea to jump on Levi's back and try to get a piggy-back ride from him, something we used to do often in the hallways of high school. I remember taking off, cigarette still in my hand, and flying at Levi from behind. 

The next morning I woke up in the hospital, I couldn't see out of my left eye and my head was in so much pain I can't even describe. Kendra and my dad were sleeping in the chairs right next to the bed and when I woke up they woke up too. They starting freaking out and a whole bunch of nurses came in and asked me a whole bunch of questions and then my mom showed up and finally I had to shout to every one to shut the fuck up and tell me what happened. 

Kendra's eyes got super wide as she told me, ""You ran up behind Levi and looked like you were trying to jump on him,"" to which I interupted and said, ""Yeah! I was trying to get him to give me piggy back ride!"" 

She shook her head and continued with, ""Dude. He threw you to the ground. He punched you a whole bunch of times in the face and was screaming. It took Hank, Joey, and Oliver to get him off of you. They had to hold him down and call the cops. It was really really bad. You were bleeding every where."" 

Turns out that in my druken state I decided that jumping on a very drunk Army field officer who has seen two tours of war in Iraq was a super good idea and got my mother fucking ass beat. 

My eye socket was broken but other then that all the other injuries were minor scraps, bruises, and such. The police wanted me to press charges and had held Levi over night but I refused as did my parents. We even issued a statement saying that what had happened was my fault and 100% preventable if I hadn't been so stupid. My dad and my grandfather are both ex-military and seriously.... I should have known. 

Levi wouldn't come near me after being released and caught the next flight back to his base 5 states away. He was almost dishonorably discharged except that my dad and my grandfather both called his boss and explained that we were not mad at all or going to press charges that we just wanted to make sure he got to counseling to help some of his PTSD. My dad also learned that Levi's team had lost 6 members his first tour of Iraq in a shoot out (something he has never told any of us back home) which just makes me hurt for him knowing that he's seen his own friends killed.

Levi still has refused to talk to me since that night minus a ""Get Well"" card I recieved with a note saying that ""I will never forgive myself for what I have done. Please find it in your heart to forgive me"". I have tried faccebook, letters, texts, calls, anything to get him to talk to me. So here's my last shot. 

Levi, I know if you read this story you'll know who you are. You're the one who introduced me to reddit so I am hoping you can see this right now. It was me who fucked up, not you. I know better then to come up from behind on someone who has seen what you have seen. I am so sorry. My eye socket healed perfect but I wish we could be friends again. So just know that TIFU... not you. "
3h97pj,non_TBI,"I hope this doesn't seem like i'm karma whoring but I posted this to r/MMA and was advised to share it with you guys. 

Like most TIFU posts this didn't happen today, but in 2007. 
I was 16 and had been training Kung Fu and Krav Maga for about 2 years. My instructor told me I had a gift and to never use my deadly techniques unless it was a life or death situation. I fed off his praise and continued paying the $19.99 monthly fees while believing I was some kind of Caucasian Jet Li. 

Around this time the UFC began to become very popular in New Zealand and everyone was talking about ex-middleweight champion Anderson Silva. Being the martial arts master I was, I decided to rent some UFC DVD's and analyse his technique. His flawless victories were simply not impressive to my delusional 16 year old brain. I thoroughly believed I knew how to dismantle him or basically any MMA fighter for that matter. 

I began boasting around school and to my girlfriend that I was going to be the next big thing in MMA and that I was going to leave school to commence my career as a certified badass. I basically quit school for a month to practice Kung Fu in my garage in addition to the 5-7 pm class at the rec center. 

Following the most cringy montage imaginable, the opportunity to crush my adversaries came with an amateur MMA fight at a warehouse bar in South Auckland. I was unaware at the time but this was actually a Maori gangster clubhouse which hosted incredibly illegal promotions for anyone ballsy enough to fight for the $500 cash prize. My friends older brother who was a gang member got me a spot and basically told me he'd murder me if I didn't show up.. like he stood a chance.  

Fast forward to fight night, I show up with my girlfriend and high school posse for support. The club looked like something out of a movie, leather jacket wearing thugs everywhere and a makeshift arena dead center. The nerves sunk in but I remembered what my electrician / part time Kung Fu master told me about fear and sucked it up. Before my fight, two huge guys were literally pulverizing each other bare knuckle until once collapsed into a mutilated heap onto the canvas. Then came my time to shine. I was announced as a Kung Fu fighter nick-named 'The Soul Eater' and was escorted into the ring. My opponent was in his mid-twenties, tall, muscular and well, actually a fighter. 

Needless to say my flying neck chop didn't bring me home the cheddar and I was hospitalized with a fractured jaw, orbital and bruised rib. Worst part is I had to go back to school where everyone had some incredibly low resolution mobile footage of me getting rag dolled by an angry Maori. 

And that there was the start and end of my fighting career.   


EDIT: Wow, I was not expecting this to get so much attention. I'm thrilled so many of you found happiness in my savage beating. Here's some additional info for those asking. Firstly, I had never properly sparred. My 'contact experience' was more like a game of touch rugby between me and my master with whiny noises and elaborate fist flailing throw in. My garage training consisted of me punching holes in sheets of paper and dry humping one of those foam human torso 'Bobs' or whatever. Secondly I had never been truly punched, let alone by a Maori who may have been an escaped military experiment. 

My mother didn't know what I was up to until she was informed of my hospitalization. She was furious at my master and confronted him during one of his classes. My girlfriend cried a lot and begged me not to fight again, she was really concerned about my opponents safety I guess. Finally, I honestly will try and locate the footage but I haven't seen it in over 5 years and now live in Australia so don't get your hopes up. I will try though.  
 

"
3i15nm,non_TBI,"This morning I decided to rub one out before going on a family outing. I'm in the shower, and searching through some videos when my wife walks in. 


She sees I have the phone in the shower and gets mad. Not because she knows what I'm doing, but just thinks I'm wasting time on Reddit when I'm supposed to be getting ready. She opens the shower to take my phone and sees my raging boner. This does not go like it does in the movies I've been watching. She reaches for my phone, and I jerk back to exit the private browser. 


This is where she flips the fuck out. 


Wife starts erupting with all her pregnancy hormones. Throws my phone across the room. Starts screaming about me cheating, and asking who I was talking to. She storms out, and I go after her, still naked and luckily grab a towel. She's still freaking out, and our 3 yo daughter comes in to see what's wrong. 


I have to try to explain to her what happened with my 3 yo there. She doesn't quite believe me. Threatens to cancel family outing which involves my parents and sister. Eventually she calmed down, believed me, and has been making fun of me all day. She's gone to bed now, and I'm on the couch for the night. 


TL;DR I tried to jerk, wife went berserk "
22p6sh,non_TBI,"Today was not a good day.

Starts off with me in class, as I feel the urge to shit, i go. Whilst I was shitting the lights went out, (some generator fail as I assume.) and I think, well fuck. I'm still gonna finish, but shitting in the dark is no easy task. As I'm almost done, I hear the door open, as the room is filled with light, only to be taken away. I hear a slight ""[hehehehehe](http://i.imgur.com/zqVZy.jpg)."" Shit that was scary. I start to hear crawling of sorts. All of the sudden, the lights came back, and I find a kid with Down syndrome crawling underneath the stall I'm in looking at me. He goes ""**HEHEHEHEHE**"" in the most terrifying voice. After my initial scream I react the only way I knew I could. I kicked his face, sending him into the stall door, where he passed out. I quickly gathered myself, got up, and ran. I'm thinking of dropping out.

Now this is, I shit you not what happened. I am in no way making fun if people with special needs. Nor should you.

EDIT: it's 11 AM and I just got called into the principals. Will update later

UPDATE: 11:40 AM Got called into principals for a reason that's uninvolved with my story. I see Down syndrome kid in the office w/ a black eye. He points at me saying ""ITS HIM HEHEHEHEHEHE"" I shit you the fuck not. Waiting outside principals again, will update soon.

UPDATe: 11:56 AM Principal yelled at me for kicking Down syndrome kid in the face. He still couldn't help but laugh. Got a Saturday school, but that's about it. I left my principal in tears of laughter though. Will be responding to most posts if you got any questions.

UPDATE: 2:47 PM Got call into the office, principal said he saw the reddit post and read over it. After ""further investigation"" of the comment section, he has lifted the detention. REDDIT: 1 DOWN SYNDROME: 0 and no I don't know his username

~~EDIT: Im now playing DayZ, if anyone would like to play and hear a wonderful story of how i kicked a down syndrome kid~~

**MANDATORY EDIT**: Fuck up of the week ey? Damn did I really fuck up that bad? "
3hx8za,non_TBI,"This is an unusual kind of fuckup.

For the last decade or so, I have been trying all the great Chinese restaurants I can locate, in an attempt to find a place that is as awesome as the one I fell in love with 25 years ago in college.  

Over these years I've been going to every different kind of Chinese restaurant I could find, trying to find something as delicious as what made me fall in love in the first place.  I kept track of the different types of sauces, tried to learn how to cook it myself from recipes, and even recently took a Chinese food cooking lesson.

Every time a fancy new Chinese restaurant opened I would be there to taste the food, going from restaurant to restaurant like Prince Charming went door to door looking for a certain foot.

Today, as I was driving down the new street I saw a really crappy looking Chinese place.  One of those in the bad part of town that also sells french fries, is all white, and is really just a takeout place. (Even though there are technically two tables in the place one is covered in magazines and the other has three kids under age 6 coloring because they are stuck there.)
 
When I saw this place I said to myself, I said ""Fuck it, I'm never going to find anything great like they used to make it back in 'my day' and I'm hungry and lazy so I'll just get some of this shitty Chinese and be done with it.""

When I got home and bit into the first dumpling, my dick got a little hard because of 25 years of searching I'd finally found the perfect Chinese food I had been searching for.  

The sauce was just perfect even though it looked so simple . . . hey wait a minute . . . the Chinese place I fell in love with in college must have been a cheap Chinese place that only college students went to.  Thinking back now, it was in a strip mall next to a laundromat.

What happened is that over the years, as my income grew, I slowly went to nicer and nicer Chinese restaurants just by default - whatever I could afford -- and I eventually got used to the fancy ones that grown-ups with spouses and mortgages go to.  

In other words, the reason I couldn't find what I wanted all these years is that I thought I was searching for the best Chinese food when what I really wanted was that same cheap strip-mall Chinese that I fell in love with so many years ago and was dirt poor.  

**TL;DR    ""Current me"" overestimated ""past me"" and I spent ten years trying to find something fancier and more expensive than I ever wanted or needed.**

***UPDATES AFTER THIS HIT THE FRONT PAGE: 
(1) I never heard of the movie Old Boy but will rent it now; (2) There's apparently an episode of HIMYM about a burger that is similar -- I haven't seen that either; (3) Tons of you agree that hole in the wall places are often the best - including a bunch of you in China right now (!!); (4) Many of you think I am probably am in love with MSG.  I am going to order some now from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Ajinomoto-Monosodium-Glutamate-Umami-Seasoning/dp/B00IH28XDE)  and start experimenting with it; (5) Yes the journey was pretty fun but I am glad to have closure now and also to move on to a different obsession, TBD. ***
"
3pj8d7,non_TBI,"I'm a dad of a beautiful 3 year old girl.  Any dad of a daughter will tell you that bathroom stuff is part of the deal.  If mom is not around, or tending to one of the others, I have to take my little girl into the men's room.  So this happened at a quiet little mom & pop restaurant.  It was just the two of us in there.  I wipe off and cover the seat so she can do her little tinkle...but then I realize I really have to go.  No big deal.  I just place her in the corner of the stall and say ""don't move.""
I start to pee.

I hear the door to the restroom open, meaning we are now no longer the only two occupants.  I hear two guys walk in.  As one of the sets of footsteps draw near, my little girl starts to back away from the door and ends up right next to me.  She looks down at what's going on (with an ""open door"" policy on the bathroom at home, and her two brothers...it's nothing she hasn't seen before) and loudly exclaims:  ""Daddy!!  Look at your little penis!!""

What...the...

I hear the other guys in the bathroom kind of snort...and then let loose in laughter.

First of all...wow.  She's never said that before...or since.  Second...WHAT IS HERE FRAME OF REFERENCE!!??  

I didn't know what I could possibly say to make it any better.  I kind of wanted to yell out ""Um..She's just kidding...it's normal size""  but I figured that any remark trying to clarify my size would just come off as creepy.  I just stayed in the stall until the other two guys left.  I couldn't face them.  I'm sure they were out there in the restaurant watching to see me come out so they could tell their wives about the guy who has a tiny wiener by three year old standards!!

TL;DR My daughter publicly insults my manhood

edit:  Wow, thanks for the interest everyone!  Also, for those concerned about ""open door policy"" I guess I should clarify that it's not so much a policy as a fact of life with 3 kids and 2 parents in a smallish house.  Everybody has seen everybody else's stuff and it's no big deal."
3huddj,non_TBI,"Just got back from the emergency room.  What a night. 

Some background:  my wife (27) and I (31) have recently gotten into swinging.  It's been a wild and crazy summer for sure, with enough sexual escapades for a lifetime.  She especially has been having a blast, since I'm the only man she's ever even kissed.  

We started out by meeting couples, then got into going to some nice exclusive swinging clubs and private parties.  Tons of fun so far. Only problem is that my erection usually doesn't last for more than 1 to 1.5 hours, but stamina-wise, I can go all night - especially in a club full of beautiful naked women. 

So...I got a little greedy.  I saw a urologist and told him I had erectile dysfunction.  He prescribed various pills, none of which seemed to prolong my hard-on. So the next step was injections straight into the side of the penis.  (I called it Viagra in the post title, but actually it's called TriMix. Same effect though.)  I initially balked at the idea, but after doing some reading on this particular medication (it lasts several hours and makes your cock hard as a diamond), I gave it a second thought. 

So I filled the prescription and decided to give it a try last night.  (To answer a question I'm sure is many readers' minds, no, it's not very painful at all.)  So I got the wife on board for a night of marathon sex, injected myself, and almost instantly got the thickest and hardest erection I've ever experienced.  I almost didn't recognize my dick.  Walking around the house with my massive shlong wagging around was great.  We had a great fuck-fest that had to be cut short, to two hours, only because she was getting sore...and so was I...

...And that's where things got dicey.  I came...twice...and it only got HARDER.  I started pouring cold water over it.  Nothing.  I took four Sudafed pills (as suggested online when you get an out-of-control erection).  Nothing.  I started exercising major muscle groups, doing endless sets of push-ups, pull-ups, squats, etc. (also recommended online, in order to divert the blood).  Nothing.  

Three hours in, it was starting to really hurt...and I was starting to panic.  Knowing that the medication came with a warning that prolonged erections lasting longer than 4 hours require emergency medical attention, I rushed to the ER.  Telling the elderly hispanic woman in triage what happened wasn't fun.  I was writhing in pain at this point, and my cock was so sensitive and painful, I *could not walk and required a wheelchair* because the sensation of it rubbing against my shorts as I walked was incredibly painful.  Yes, I was awkwardly covering up my erection the entire time.  

Eventually I got wheeled into a room.  I got two full doses of morphine before I calmed down a bit.  40 minutes later, a team of doctors and nurses came in.  The resident doctor was a young, cute Indian woman who - unlike the others in the room who tried very hard to act serious - read me and the situation better and made it pretty clear that she thought this was all pretty hilarious and cheered me up immediately, by turns making fun of me and being very vaguely flirtatious. 

Eventually they got a butterfly needle and proceeded to extract a STUPENDOUS amount of blood out of my cock, as the doctors took turns squeezing my dick like a lemon.  Pics of cock, and jar of blood below, obviously NSFW:

http://imgur.com/a/GFyT7

Needless to say, I'll be doing this again, starting at a third of the first dosage.

TL;DR:  wanted to be a sex god by injecting an ED drug directly into my penis, had to rush to the emergency room because it nearly exploded, had to get all the blood drained and squeezed out of my cock.  Good times. 



EDIT:  thank you for the gold, kind stranger. And I'm overwhelmed at all the adulation and admiration for my dick.  Much appreciated. Y'all should have seen it BEFORE it was drained. To clear up a popular misunderstanding though, that is NOT blood covering my dick. It's iodine and lidocaine.  

I'm happy to report that although my dick looks like it's been in a UFC fight (very black and blue from all the squeezing and needles from last night), it feels completely fine, and I've even been getting very hard, spontaneous erections throughout the day today. "
2jc9jk,non_TBI,"So just to set the stage here my wife is currently surfing the red tide solo.  During these monthly events my board is kicking it on the beach waiting for better days. 
  So after watching the family friendly Tosh.O we've been playing the scare game trying to freak each other out on random occasions.  Of course I am the master having got the kids and the wife numerous times and they have failed to scare me yet. But enough of me beating my chest, lets get to the fuck up.

  So the 14 year old is grounded and stuck at home and the 8 and 9 year olds have just finished their homework.  My gorgeous wife calls me saying that she is almost home and that I should get the kids out of the house and take them to the park where she will meet us later after she gets home and changes.  Thats when it hits me... What a perfect opportunity for the four of us to scare the crap out of her.  The first thing she does when she gets home is go to our closet to change clothes.

So I hatch the plan with the kids that we should pretend we went to the park but instead hide in the closet to scare Mom instead.  Everyone loved the idea especially since it didnt involve them being freaked out for once.

So we see her pull into the alley and we scramble into the closet and wait.  Im trying to get them to all stop snickering as we hear the garage door close.  Then come the foot steps down the hall...  Her purse hits the desk and we can hear her fumbling around the room.  The dresser drawer opens and in the back of my head a brain cell lights up... But no thats not going to happen... And then it does.  

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and moans start to fill the room.  I look at the puzzled faces of the two innocent ones and the revolting shock of disgust on the 14 year old and did the only thing I could think to do.... ""Hey angel we are in the closet and we were going to scare you.  Coming out in 1 minute.""

We are still trying to process this event.  But needless to say Im still laughing my ass off and she has this sheepish look on her face.  Not sure what we are going to say to the 8 & 9 year old... And I think the 14 year old will never be the same again.  

So there ya go."

'Oh shit, I'm dick to ass with some guy who is already in here.'

He looked back at me as if I just shat in his cornflakes and then we both shuffled our feet at breakneck speed because people were still entering the door in the opposite direction.

I tried to laugh it off, but I overplayed the laugh and just kind of did a maniacal laugh like it was some nefarious plot of mine.

3apjlk,non_TBI,"When I was in high school years ago, my girlfriend and I would often fool around on the couch in her parents living room. Her parents would always go upstairs to watch TV in the evening, so this worked out perfectly for us. During this one particular evening, we both ended up falling asleep with half our clothes off (unintentionally) and slept right through until the morning. I was shocked to wake up the next morning to the sound of her Dad's footsteps upstairs. I threw my clothes on in record time and tried to run out of the house but that plan did not succeed. I did make it as far as the front door just as her Dad was coming down the stairs. Her Dad is clearly surprised to see me. He slowly says to me: ""Oh, hello Kangar, what are you doing here?"" OK, it was 5:30 in the morning, so this is what comes out of my mouth. I say: ""Oh, hi Mr. Jones, I'm just going out fishing for the day, and thought I would come say hello to Susan first."" To my great astonishment, HE BUYS THIS EXPLANATION. He smiles, wishes me good luck fishing, and goes to read the morning paper. Susan told me that years later she told her Mom this story, and the two of them still laugh at her Dad for falling for this.

My wife's cousins had traveled to my city to visit ([somehow they are always around for my fuck ups!](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2ix5ss/tifu_by_being_overenthusiastic_about_my_salad_in/)), and we decided to go see a movie. I was talking about the superiority of American popcorn and they were making the predictable ""fat American"" jokes about our cultural need to pour fat on everything. We were going back and forth, and I got so worked up in my patriotic fervor that I told them I would bring my own butter to the movies to demonstrate how great it was. I melt a stick of butter in the microwave, pour it into a glass jar, put the jar into the pocket of my peacoat, and we head to the movies.

It was the dead of Polish winter, and it took us quite some time to take the trams to the theater. By the time we get there, the butter had congealed to a semi-solid that was glued to the bottom of the jar. No problem, we buy a large popcorn and my cousin holds it while waiting for me outside the men's room. I go into one of the stalls, hold the jar by the rim, and strike my lighter underneath it. Unfortunately, the lighter made quite a distinct sound, and people in the bathroom heard it. The gap in the stall door frame was quite wide, and a couple of people shot glances my way. I'm not sure what they think they saw, but it must have been weird to see a guy with a lighter under a glass. I heard whispers about ""narkotyki"" and started to get nervous. Was security about to get called on me for suspected crack smoking? 

Fortunately, the butter melted quite quickly and I decided to make a run for it. *Unfortunately*, the jar was way too hot to hold anywhere except by the rim. So I did the only thing I could think of, which was to hold the jar in front of me by the rim and briskly walk out of the bathroom before my fingers burned. The crowd parted wide for me as I half-ran through the bathroom holding a mysterious jar of yellow liquid. People were equally stunned outside the bathroom when I emerged. An entire theater was emptying out in front of me, and all they saw was a frantic-looking man running out of a bathroom and hurriedly dumping a jar of yellow fluid into a popcorn bag held by an embarrassed-looking accomplice. There were several pronounced looks of disgust.

I can't say that I kept my head held high after that, but I can say that I enjoyed the hell out of that buttered popcorn while watching that movie. Good times. I still love popcorn, but these days I'm more into olive oil and nutritional yeast than butter.

TL;DR: My American love of grease makes Poles think I'm a crackhead who enjoys flavoring my food with urine"
2pqn0e,non_TBI,"Okay, time for some background and disclosure. My Biology teacher (we'll call her ""Kate""), is hot. I don't mean this in a ""I want to have sex with her"" way, but rather a ""I'd like to unzip her genes"" way (yes, I got that off the internet). Either way, she has been at the school for five years, and in that time the school has come to an informal consensus that her Ass should be the mark to which other Asses are compared. For example, if me and my friends are checking some girl out, we'd say ""Not as good as Kate's, but not bad either"". This leads us to today.

My Biology teacher (who is awesome), had previously told us that she liked to matchmake within her classes, and I decided to take my chances in getting in a class with the hottest girl in my grade (we're juniors). As such, I walked up to my Biology teacher, and casually asked if next semester she could pair us together (I'm really sleep-deprived from finals, so my inhibition is turned off). At this, she smiled and said ""you think she's attractive don't you"". This is where I fucked up. I, without looking at my teacher and mistaking this casual conversation with those that I have with my friends, said ""Well her Ass isn't Kate good, but it's...."" At this, she raised her eyebrow and smiled a bit at my embarrassment, and then turned and walked away. I have Bio tomorrow, and don't know how I can face her again.

Tl;dr My Bio teacher's ass is the informal benchmark at my school for a good ass. Accidentally let it slip in a conversation with her that I thought my classmate's ass was almost at her level.

Edit: Not going to share photo of Teacher's ass. Don't want identification. However, this is roughly equivalent (except blonde and white pants) http://i.imgur.com/7KtTI.jpg

Update: Thanks for the Gold! I did go to school again today, and I did go to Biology class. After reading all of your comments, I decided to play it cool, and bank on sitting next to the girl in my grade, and it worked! She announced seating charts. Also, some of my friends discovered this, and they loved the fact that ""Kate Good"" was now Reddit's benchmark. Thanks for all the comments!"
321rzk,non_TBI,"I work in IT at a graduate school at a large, semi-prestigious university.  

After attending to a call, I came back up the stairwell and as I opened the door I saw a yellow jacket (wasp) on the door frame next to the handle.

Keeping the door open (because I didn't want the little asshole to get spooked and fly off), I took my shoe off and THWAPED him pretty hard (perhaps a little harder than intended).  He fell, and I said to myself, ""Good job, me, you saved the school"".

Almost immediately after that, there's a school lockdown.  I'm told to get in my office, lock the doors and shut the lights off.  There's some important government people who work here, so I figure maybe they do this as a drill every so often so whatever.  But I'm still kind of nervous. 

I texted someone up at the front desk ""wtf"" and they texted back ""there was a gunshot"". 

I guess that staircase is pretty echo-y, because the next thing I know I'm trying not to laugh as police officer is questioning me, getting my information, and taking pictures of my kill like hes the fuckin wasp FBI.  At some point I heard mention of a SWAT team on standby.  It didn't even die, it was still wiggling around as he was photographing the crime scene.  

I can't work here anymore, everyone's calling me ""shooter"".  I was just trying to help.

Update 2: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2z6b65/tifupdate_by_sexting_my_girlfriends_sister_and/

Little back story, I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 4 years now and would never cheat on her. We have a very intimate relationship and live together. I am very close with her family, who like me a lot. I naturally have her father, mother and sisters phone number.

We have been planning Thanksgiving dinner for the past few days (We switch off every year with her and my family) with her family on where to have it, I've been out of town for the past week for work and have been communicating through text with her and her family. This is where everything went wrong.


I was texting my girlfriend and her sister. I was texting her sister about her staying out our place after dinner (She didn't want to pay for a cab back would be $100+). Meanwhile my gf starts sexting me from home. Giving me some NSFW pics and dirty messages. I am responding back and forth. She asks me ""Show me what you've go right now"". Right as I read that I got a call (Work stuff) and have to take care of that really quick. Mid-way through the call my gf's sister texts me back about staying after thanksgiving. In my horny rage I didn't notice she had responded, I just took a picture of my dick, clicked the first option on my phone and sent the pic saying ""You think you can handle this?"" About two minutes later her sister texts me back ""I've been wanting it for the longest time"". Needless to say, my response to her wasn't what she wanted to hear, and my girlfriend is pissed. Thanksgiving should be fun!

Tl;Dr: Was sexting my girlfriend, got a call from work, mid-way through call gf's sister texts me, I don't notice and send her a pic of my dick, she says she wants to bang. Thanksgiving is going to be a blast.

*For all of you asking. My girlfriend is the hotter sister.*

Edit 1: People asking if I told my gf. Yes I did, she was angry but understood it was a mistake and I didn't mean it. She's more upset at her sister.

Edit 2: To those asking if her parents know about this. No they do not, we are going to see them next weekend though and we're going to tell them then. I don't like secrets.

Edit 3: You guys seem very on the side of don't tell the parents. This isn't my choice just so you know, I am completely leaving this up to her. She said she wants to because she wants this out in the air. I told her we could do that with just us 3 talking. I'll let you guys know how that conversation goes.

**Edit 4: She has decided to not tell her parents** after your guys comments. Rest assured this will stay between the 3 of us.

Edit 5: To those of you asking ""Why did you tell your gf in the first place?"" You've never been in a long-lasting relationship. Secrets are basically non-existent, honesty is the best thing. In retrospect could I have kept this a secret? Maybe, but I'm not willing to take the chance of her finding out down the line and being upset with me and losing her. 

Edit 6: Front page! Girlfriend is happy this experience happened now. You'll all be mentioned at the wedding!

Edit 7: A lot of people giving me shit for telling my girlfriend. Calm down people, I handle something one way, you can handle it another. You never know what you'll do until it happens.

**Edit 8: For those wondering how the conversation went between my girlfriend and her sister**. Its as awkward as you can imagine. To the sisters credit she confessed that she actually is attracted to me and apologized for responding. I apologized for not looking who I sent it to. My gf and her talked privately for a while (I left the room). All seems well they hugged and she's staying for thanksgiving... she's on close surveillance though."
3lnpf0,non_TBI,"Warning: NSFL

I'm currently remodeling alot of my house and last night I started sanding and pulling nails in our stairwell. So as a nude sleeper I hear my wife screaming at 6:00am and being the good husband I am I fly out from under the blanket on my bed and start making my way down the stairs only to trip over the hammer my lazy ass left out. At this point I'm in full somersault mode and after falling for what felt like 15 seconds I came to a crashing halt but I could feel this overwhelming pain and started calling for help. When I started checking myself I realized what had happened my ballsack had caught a loose nail and torn completely open , I had a perfect window into them and when I stood up one of my balls were falling out of the sack. Here is the kicker,  On the way to the hospital I asked her why she screamed ""oh....I saw a spider"". I just left the ER with 18 stitches.

Edit: added nsfl tag

Edit #2: thank you for gold and thank you for the kind words the pain killers are working great and I get to take a week off work so don't feel to bad for me."
3y8tc4,non_TBI,"Alright reddit, this actually happened today, four hours ago to be exact.
I'm 28 years old and have a girlfriend. We have been together for about three years now and things are (were?) going okay. We aren't officially living together, but most of the nights she sleeps over at my place. 
So after we had dinner I was watching some Seinfeld on my laptop sitting on the couch when she drops herself besides me. She tells me she is bored and that she wants to do something. Okay then, I ask her what she was thinking about doing then, not really paying attention since it was the answering machine episode and George's song was coming up. She says ""Oh I dunno haha, we could watch porn together, that would be fun right?"". So now she got my attention and I could tell this wasn't something she just came up with on the spot organically, she sounded excited and I could tell the whole ""I'm bored"" thing was just a playful act to do some bf/gf stuff. ""Well, okay why not"", I tell her. Alright then!, she is all energetic and she jumps beside me on the couch in a playful manner smiling and all jumpy, cuddling besides me. 

I don't actually think she normally watches porn herself. Obviously the reason she wanted to watch porn with me in the first place was the same reason you watch a bad horror movie together, to laugh and make comments on everything that's happening, you know, you watch it in a ironic way I guess. Watching some cheesy porn scene and making comments on how absurd the premise is, some funny zingers about the setting and maybe sexy talk, you know, good stuff. I should have put on a lengthy cheesy porn flick or something. This is very obvious to me right now, typing this; Two hours ago, this was NOT that obvious. This is where the fuckup starts. I have never. cringed this hard while typing something.

So here I am, laptop on my lap and my girlfriend next to me on the couch, looking at the screen. I pause the seinfeld episode and open a new tab in the browser. ""Sooo, what do you want to watch"", I asked her. 
  ""Well I don't know haha, you are the expert here right?"". ""just do what you normally do haha"".
What the fuck woman. Obviously there is no way she is going to be invited to witness the dark ritual that is my pornwatching. Oh sure, let's first watch some hardcore porn GIFS on an obscure subreddit whose url I know by heart to then proceed to xvideos to watch a video of a dominatrix cum in the mouth of a woman. Good idea, Fun times /s. 

So now, I start to panic a little bit. ""Okay then. Let's see here.."" I am not going to screw this up. I slowly type xhamster.com in the urlbar, because, in that moment for some reason I was certain that xhamster was the most normal porn website I could choose. What the fuck brain. I press enter and the website is coming up. I can notice she looks closer at the screen, like she misread the name of the site the first time. So the website is loaded and we are looking at the homepage. We were going to watch something extremely vanilla or I would die trying.

My mind is going bezerk: Okay, no lesbian stuff obviously. No anal/DP, I don't want her to think I would like to try that with her. No threesome porn. No facial stuff, she might think I'm a perv. No mentions of milfs/teens/girls/specific race of course.. 

I am staring at this homepage without scrolling and I can feel that she is kinda weirded out. I just can't decide what video to click on. I decide to use the search function. I type the most normal phrase I could think of: ""Big tit has sex with man"" What in the flying fuck brain!? ""Big tit has sex with man"". I can hear her reading it. Holy shit this is bad.  For some stupid reason I didn't feel that I could just tell her it was a mistake or make a joke out of it. No fun comments. Just me, looking at the screen silently and dead serious waiting for the page to load completely, focused to make sure that I don't click on something weird. So I click on a video in the list that had what I thought was a pretty normal thumbnail. It turned out to be some shaky homemade amateur videotape of a married couple having sex in what I guess was their trailerhome. I was staring at the screen with a complete pokerface, with my two hands on the keyboard. I could feel her judging me. The atmosphere was really weird. What could I say? Should I turn the video off? What was she thinking? Why wasn't she saying anything? The video finally ends and I ask her if she wants to watch in bed. ^wtfbrain. She says, ""well I think I'm gonna head home actually"". She left.
No I'm here in bed all alone typing this story. Should I call/text her? I really fucked up here, I really wen't full retard.

Cliffs: GF wanted to watch porn with me, screwed it up because I didn't want to watching something weird, ended up watching something extremely weird. GF left.


**UPDATE:** Hey guys. Wow, I really didn't except this to blew up like it did. I want to thank you all for your kind words and pieces of advice. I called her up the next day, explained what went through my head like you guys adviced me to and I guess she understood my ""struggle"" and everything is fine now. 

A friend of mine gave me this cool advice to watch Taxi Driver with her, since in that movie there is a scene where Robert Deniro's character awkwardly  takes a girl to a porn theatre for their first date. We might watch that later tonight, maybe that scene will start a conversation about how weird and, in hindsight, how humerous that night was. 

Thanks again for the advice and I'd like to wish you all a happy New Year!

2fc62m,non_TBI,"EDIT: [Update here.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2feoep/tifupdate_tifu_by_letting_my_boyfriend_finger_me/)

It was supposed to be romantic. It was our last night together before he left on a plane, not to see me for months, and we were about to get groovy.

We were under the stars, kissing and holding each other and spending a long time on the perfect foreplay. It was fucking amazing. We were ready to fuck like animals and to make sweet love all at once.

We were naked and touching each other to build up suspense, and he began to finger me hard, leaving me moaning, but with an... odd... sensation as well.

   ""There's something inside you,"" he said.

   ""There's nothing, don't stop,"" I replied, uneasily. 

   ""No, there's something inside you. It feels plastic.""

Horror chills my veins. It had been about two weeks since my period. But I knew then that I had left my menstrual cup (basically a plastic cup for blood/period gunk not to be left in longer than 12 hours) in for the past *14 days.* 

IDIOTICALLY, I asked him to help me remove it so we could continue. MOTHER OF GOD... it smelled like an eviscerated decomposing body mixed with rotting broccoli, sewage, and rotting eggs ALL IN ONE. And the smell DID NOT GO AWAY. I threw out the cup and its contents, but the stench of 14 day old rotting blood and uterine gunk is not one that fades easily. I could tell my squeamish boyfriend was trying extremely hard not to lose his shit and vomit. But it only got worse from there.

The stench would not leave, and it was coming from my vagina. To try and bring the mood back, I went to the bathroom to try and freshen up. He joined me, perhaps to make me feel less disgusting. Bad idea. With a feeling like an impending queef but somehow *thicker*, my vagina suddenly emptied a massive glob of this filth and it splattered a surprisingly large amount of brown rotted uterine filth all over my poor boyfriend's leg... He practically ran home.


"
31yt8w,non_TBI,"I have been playing a subtle and what I thought harmless prank on one of my co-workers for the last four and a half years. 

This guy, let's give him a fake name of Reginald, is a bit of an oddball, but a good dude. He is very quiet and polite, kind of keeps to himself, but sometimes comes up with random and hilarious one-liners out of nowhere. I like him. 

About four and a half years ago I did this prank for the first time. He always has a post-it note pad on his desk. I turned to a post-it note a few pages (is 'pages' the right word?) back and wrote the word ""Fart!"" on the post-it. A few days later he got to that post-it note, saw the word, stared at it for a few seconds, and said out loud to himself ""...What!?"" He then quickly removed that post-it, ripped it into three pieces, and threw it in the trash.

So, I have done this about once every two weeks for the last four and a half years. I can't even count how many times I have done. But literally every single time I see him find the post-it he does the EXACT same thing. In the same exact tone of voice, to himself, he says ""...What!?"" And then every single time he always rips it into THREE pieces and throws it away.

Nobody else has ever seen the post-it. He has never told anyone, as far as I know. He just, every time, almost as if he is seeing it the first time, says ""...What!?"" and rips it into three pieces.

I kind of became obsessed with this. I just waned to see if he'd ever do something different.

Well, today, he did. I saw him write a post-it note, pull it off the pad, and thereby revealed the post-it I'd written ""Fart!"" on. 

This time, it was different. He stared at it in silence for a solid five minutes. Suddenly, he SHOUTED. This crazy primal roar sort of a shout. He picked up his computer monitor and slammed it into the floor. He held up the post-it note pad and screamed ""WHO IS DOING THIS!?!"" 

Everyone stared at him in shock, myself included. Nobody said a word. After a moment he ran out of the office.

I am mortified and full of shame. I thought it was a harmless prank but apparently it had been really bothering him for the past few years and he just snapped. 

I want to apologize in person, but I won't, because I refuse to take responsibility. I don't want people to think negatively of me. I think I will apologize anonymously, and explain I meant no harm. I feel terrible."
3vrdey,non_TBI,"So I got off early from work today and came inside. My wife had been over at the neighbor's place and was just coming back inside. I was just about to leave the bathroom (right next to our back door) and impulsively thought I could be really funny. So, waiting for the perfect moment, I opened the door and yelled right as she walked past.

It was perfect. She screamed and jumped really badly, and then began to laugh really hard as she realized what had happened. But there was one thing I had not taken into account during my impulsive decision. My wife was 39 1/2 weeks pregnant. Keyword: WAS.

Yep. I scared my wife into labor. At first we thought it was just flase contractions again, but very quickly realized that this was the real thing. Thirteen hours later and we have a beautiful, healthy baby girl.

Everything worked out well, but during labor my wife was NOT amused (though the doctor was a little) when she told him what had caused her to go into labor. Still, lesson learned: do not try to be funny by scaring your heavily pregnant wife."
306xj9,non_TBI,"This happened this morning. I'm Australian, so it's still morning, and I'm still shaking. 

For background I'm female, mid-20s and work a corporate job at a big firm. I decided to work from home today. There's lots of perks working from home, one being that clothes are optional. I set up my laptop and sit it in front of my naked body. We just got this new program set up where any call that comes through to my office phone is transferred to my laptop and can be answered on screen, using the inbuilt mic. Brilliant! Lets test this baby out. I first call my mobile from the program and all works great. I then proceed to call my boss (45 year old awkward male) from my laptop and, like a baby boomer using Skype for the first time, lean up close to the mic to test the audio 'Hi Boss! Just testing the new program out! Hows everything going?' I don't hear anything except slight background noises for a about 10 seconds, then he hangs up. Hmm I'll call my colleague (mid 30s nerd-like male) instead. 'Heyy! Can you hear me??' A stumble of words come out from my mic, I hear a faint gasp, a laugh and then after a few seconds he too hangs up. I give up. Maybe it's broken. 
10 minutes go by and I receive a call from a lady that works in the project division. I answer with a 'Hi Patricia!'. There's a long pause. I lean in further to my screen, boobs perked above the keyboard 'Patricia, I'm working from home today, can you hear me?'. I hear a 'oh my god' Then she too, she hangs up. Things are getting weird. 
Not 30 seconds go by and I receive an email from Patricia: 'swallowing_panda, sweetie, put some clothes on'. 

I want to die.

3tkn7t,non_TBI,"This happend just 2-3 hours ago. Today is my first day of my internship at a supermarket. For my internship I need to do a research. They put me in an office with an one-way window that has a view over the store, mainly the cash registers.

I have a friend who works at this supermarket and this is how I got my internship at the store. After 2 hours of my internship I spoke with my friend. She told me that one of the cashiers thought I was cute. I was curious who it was because I never had a girlfriend before and have a low self-esteem. She pointed out who it was. I was really excited.

So I went back to the office and stared at her for a good 15 minutes through the one-way window. She sometimes looked at the window but I was like 'hey, you can't see me through this window' so I kept staring at her. I was pretty sure she was just looking at customers who were near the window. 

I left the office to go to the toilet. While I was heading back to the office I realized I could see through the window. Welp, apparently if you switch the lights on of the office the effect of the one-way window goes away. I have been basically staring at her with a creepy face for full 15 minutes and she knew.

I bet she doesn't think that I'm cute anymore."
3mqntm,non_TBI,"Most front page TIFU I see involve sex. /r/circlejerk makes allusions to this with ""TIFU by putting my PENIS into my GIRLFRIEND's VAGINA""

More and more I see TIFU which just seem to be people either wanting to say they've had sex, or making completely fake stories with plot holes in their own stories.

I get the weekend rule, which is fantastic, but what happened to this subreddit? Before I had this account it was my first subreddit to browse, and now it just seems to be kids acting like my example below.

But since this is TIFU, I must provide a TIFU:

ex.

TIFU by being so *fucking* better than you. I also had sex. With a girl. In her vagina. The upper one. She came. Then her sister heard us having sex and insisted she join because im so good. Then my already 12 inch penis grew 4 more inches, before I became president of the world.

3gc948,non_TBI,"So, today I fucked up by taking my wife to see Ant Man. Yeah .. see we're newly married but have been together several years. We're moving house and I'm under a lot of stress with new city new job and I was getting cabin fever and just had to get out of the house. I chimed to my wife that we should go see a movie! There's a new Marvel one that I want to see. And she happily agreed.

I bought tickets and we went in. She was clutching my arm rather tightly and she cuddled in close when the title came up but I thought nothing of it. We're very close and it's not uncommon. You see at this point I hadn't even thought about it ...

My wife suffers Myrmecophobia. Or a fear of ANTS.

Yeah .. she had seen my stress levels and put aside her darkest fear to accompany me to a movie willingly that portrays her worst fear in detail.

As a side note she thoroughly enjoyed it; and buried her face in my arm any time she started to feel uncomfortable. So as a homage to her I felt I should share this story on Reddit. I could ask for no better life partner.

TLDR: I took my wife to see the Ant Man movie. Totally forgot she has a morbid fear of ANTS.


**Edit:** I woke up this morning with front page of reddit ..  Thank you all for your kind words and great comments. My wife read through this whole thread and had one hell of a laugh (and got itchy at the mention of 3D .. thanks guys .. TIFU by letting my wife read the comments on the thread I made for her) 

To those asking 'Was it a good movie?' I would have to say yes; if you enjoyed the Avengers (2) and/or the Iron Man series it's in that same sort of comedy style. Very entertaining."
31cmqi,non_TBI,"I walk into starbucks and take my place at the end of a rather long line. I notice in front of me a group of about 10 adult men who have Down Syndrome who are on a ""field trip"" and being chaperoned by an older woman. The woman turns to me and says ""we are going to be a while, why don't you go in front of our group."" She then loudly announces to her entire group that I will be skipping ahead in line and that it's ok. I thank her and begin to walk up the side of the line, looking at each man in line as I pass to ascertain whether he has down syndrome, and continue forward to find where their group ends and my new place in line is. I lock eyes with the frontmost man who has Down Syndrome, and slide into line in front of him. A few moments later I get a tap on the shoulder, and the man I had moments ago locked eyes with begins to explain in a broken, defeated voice that he's not with that group. I respond ""oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were..."" and my voice trails off as I realize that I had mistaken this rather unattractive man as having down syndrome and pretty much everyone in starbucks saw it go down. He stood there uncomfortably shifting on his feet for a moment and then B-lined it for the door, didn't even get his coffee. So awkward. I can't even imagine the damage I did to his self esteem.

Well, he proceeds to inform me that while he's happy that my husband and I have a great sex life that he would greatly appreciate if we kept it down in the early evening hours since he had to explain the birds and bees to his 8yo last night.

At this point, I'm confused. We didn't have sex last night. What is he talking about? Then it dawns on me... What they actually heard was us playing Mario kart. They heard me screaming ""fuck me"" repeatedly while getting hit with a blue shell just before the finish line along with some other colorful language.

TL;DR My neighbor thinks we have a great sex life; I just have a dirty whore mouth while playing Mario kart.

Update: I let my husband know what's up and he just about died of laughter. He is working second shift, so I went over myself to clear the air. Explained what happened to my neighbor, he got embarassed, laughed, and said he wished he had thought of that in the moment.

On my way out I notice a homeless man sitting by the wall and thought I'd be generous and throw him an orange, so with a weak underarm throw the orange goes flying through the air and hits him square in the face, I quickly find out he's blind after a lot of apologizing and offer to peel the orange for him.

TL;DR Threw an orange at a blind, homeless dude, you can guess the rest

Edit: threw to through, I suck at spelling

Edit2: time to do the HOLY SHIT THIS BLEW UP and RIP my inbox

Edit3: and I made my username for the Gangplank rework because I am unoriginal, it's just a coincidence that it matched the story

 "
3ibx7k,non_TBI,"So this happened a few years ago but definitely a fuck up. In grade school, we were pretty messed up and racist kids. The Mexican kids would always butt heads with the Asian kids and that would be settled in soccer games. Of course, during the games, obscenities would be thrown around. Won't be forgetting this one anytime soon. My opponent yells at me ""Hey I banged your mom last night"" like a typical middle schooler. I shout back ""Yeah, at least I have a mom"" cleverly. Next thing I know, he's running off the field with his head in his hands. Turns out, his mom had gotten deported last week. Later that week, he socked me in the jaw,"
3q88s5,non_TBI,"Obvious throwaway for this one. 

So I play a game called ""CS:GO"". In this game you can bind your keys to the different types of grenades for fast access. As a result of this and all of the other keys in use, all the keys that are available are super uncomfortable as a push to talk. Then I had a great idea. I went on Amazon, and bought a pedal that I could connect to my PC. I couldn't find the exact one, but this is similar http://www.amazon.com/Control-Keyboard-Action-Switch-Pedal/dp/B00B3PV47O . Paid extra for overnight shipping and viola! I had push to talk bound to the pedal the next day. It all felt so natural. Now, I'm 15 and just recently I got my learners permit to drive on with a parent or guardian. My mom does this thing where she asks me to drive her to places to run errands or buy groceries so I can get a lot of practice in. One day she asked me to take her to the local grocery store. Me being the kid that loves driving, I agreed. Now at this point, me pushing down a pedal to talk to someone became complete muscle memory. Around 2 minutes into the drive we have to stop at a red light. My mom starts talking to me about what car I want to get when I turn 16. I opened my mouth, and it happened. Next thing I know the frontside of the car that I'm driving is in the bumper of the car in front of me. 

Needless to say, I won't be driving my own car for a while.

TLDR: Bound push to talk to a pedal on my PC, ended up rear ending a car when trying to talk to my mom in the car. "
3kb1x2,non_TBI,"So I had my first car couple months ago and been driving like an idiot sometimes. This morning whilst giving my brother a lift to school I stop at these traffic lights, next to me comes a black bmw and 2 men dressed in polos, for fun I revved my engine and so did they, when the light turned green I put my foot down, just when I passed 30mph their blue lights come on and they stop me. I almost shit myself, shaking I open the window and one cop comes up and says 'if we'd put our foot down we'd smoke you' and starts laughing whilst walking away. NEVER GOING TO DRIVE LIKE AN IDIOT AGAIN, I PROMISE"
3vxdt1,non_TBI,"So, this happened yesterday.  I went out to get my hair cut at a local chain store that I go to on a biweekly basis.  

I don't usually request a specific stylist, so I log into the system and take my seat until I'm called by a girl that I've never seen before.  I find out this is actually her 2nd day here.  I pop a squat in the barber chair and we start to exchange pleasantries.  She's quite cute and we are actually hitting it off very well (I know, it's her job to be pleasant).  We talk about common interests an Christmas shopping comes up and she mentions how she needed to this job to afford gifts for her family.

So she finishes my cut and we go back for her to wash my hair.  This is by far my favorite part of the whole experience.  Getting your hair washed by a cute girl is probably the closest I ever come to feeling like those guys in the movies who have beautiful women feed them grapes. (Idk, the analogy fits in my mind).  This girl goes all out.  Perfect water temperature, massages my scalp AND my neck!  I'm sitting here feeling absolutely amazing!  

She finishes up, puts some product in my hair and I'm feeling really good about how I look and feel.  This girl definitely earned her tip.  We walk over to the register and I swipe my card and await the prompt on the screen to add the tip.  My total comes to $16.20.  $5.00 tip is more than fair, especially since she went all out with the head massage.  I punch in my tip amount and immediately hit the confirm button.  As I wait for my recept, I watch the girls eyes get huge and she looks at me in excitiment.  She run from behind the counter and hugs me!  I'm flabbergasted!  She starts getting teary eyes and stumbles over herself to say ""thank you"" over and over.  I'm thinkin, man, it's just 5 bucks, but I won't say no to a hug from a cute random girl.  

She hands me my recept and I start to make my way to the door when I realize what had happened.  When I punched in the 5.00, I accidentally hit the 0 an extra time... I tipped her $50.00 instead of $5.00.  Shit.  At this point I need to make a decision.  Do I wreck this girls day by admitting I made a mistake, or do I just eat the $66.00 hair cut?  I turn around and take another look at her.  She's still so excited, looking close to tears.  She's probably thinking she's so lucky that this guy just came in, sat in her chair, and just helped her make her Christmas a little bit better out of the kindness of his heart.  I look at my recept again and sigh to myself.  ""Merry Christmas!""  I turn and leave, leaving a little bit of Christmas spirit and a nice chunk of my bank account.

TL;DR accedently tipped my hair dresser $50.00 instead of $5.00.  Didn't want to ruin her Christmas Spirit, let her keep it.

Edit: I'm male, stylist was female.

Edit2:  Holy crap my inbox...

So to clear up a few things.  

I've always gotten my hair washed after the cut.  This helps wash away the hair clippings so you're not itching all day.  I do my hair stylists a favor by washing my hair before each cut.

No I didn't shit on her chair.

I go to a Hair Cuttery.  I like it there.  People are nice and a cut is $20.  $16.20 with military discount.  I find it insane that people drop 50-100 every time they get a hair cut, but that's just me :)

As said above, I'm in the military, so I get my hair cut every two weeks.

Thanks for all the kind words and encouragement to attempt to go on a date with this hair dresser... if I can muster up the courage, I might, but I don't know if I want to rock the boat at a place I enjoy getting my hair cut.  Also, I'm less than 8 months from moving, not sure if nows the time to start a relationship.

I'm really glad some people can get a nice story from this, and if I changed a few lives because of it, that's all the gratuity I need.  I just want the world I live in to be a bit better.

The $50 would have gone to buying Fallout, but I'll be just fine picking it up after the new year. 

Merry Christmas ya'll

One more Edit I promise.

Thank you all who are offering to purchase Fallout for me, I really do appreciate the offer, but there are plenty of other people who would really benefit from your generosity more so than me.  You guys are awesome!

3evkpi,non_TBI,"I'm a single guy and whenever my daughter asks what I want as a present, I always say she should bring me back a pretty girlfriend. It's like a running joke with her usual response being ""she better not be prettier than me""

Anyway I was recently really ill with tonsilitis. Like the most ill I've ever been as an adult, and after a week of it I decided to go to the docs to get some antibiotics. 

We're the waiting room of the surgery and daughter is reading through the magazines. She's holding up pictures of different women asking me ""how bout that one Dad? or that one, or that one"" I'm like ""what for?"" thinking she means hairstyles. She comes and whispers in my ear ""for a new girlfriend"" (bless her).

I tell her magazine people are not real and she needs to find me a real person to be my girlfriend. And that I would be really silly if I cut one of them out, put it in my pocket and told everyone that she was my girlfriend!

While we're having this stupid conversation a large elderly woman shuffles across the waiting room and sits opposite us. She remarks about daughter and how cute & well behaved she is....daughter looks at her, then at me, then back at her and says, as loud as anything....

""YOU CAN'T HAVE HER AS YOUR GIRLFRIEND, SHE EATS TOO MUCH!!!""

...before I had even processed what she just said, the stunned silence was broken by people giggling in the background, and the woman just ""hmmphd"" and turned away before I could apologise. ( I did say sorry)"
3dw5b3,non_TBI,"I decided to go to a yoga class. OK. That’s obviously a lie. My GF talked me into it. She said something about how flexibility is a real turn on or people should be able to touch their toes without sweating and gargling, or some such malarkey. In reality, I think she just didn’t want to go alone, and taking me meant that there was no possible way for her to be the worst one there. And I’m obviously too dumb to realize all of this because it all just now occurred to me. Damn it. 

Anyways, I went. When we arrived, I was the only dude there. Everyone else was in good shape, female, and wearing all of the yoga accoutrements. Yoga pants, headbands, funky big shirts that still showed some part of their athletic tops, and bare feet. Most of them were standing around on one foot with their other foot flamingoed to their knees.  They were probably drinking herbal tea and discussing their upcoming retreat to India. They were all petite and graceful. And then there was me. I looked like a guy at a pick-up basketball game that was about to get chosen last.  

I walked over to the lady behind the computer to pay up. The computer was playing soft world music.  I paid my money, and was given a yoga mat, a towel, a foam block,  a nylon strap thingy, and a pillow.  I was fairly confused by most of these items, but I couldn’t help but be a little excited by the pillow and the prospect of a nap.  

When I walked in, nearly all of the spots were taken. There were two spots together in the far back corner next to the door and the fan. Perfect for the old cool down and escape routine I was already planning in my head. I put down my mat in its little premarked mat parking spot, and I flopped down. I left my brick, nylon strap, and pillow behind me.  I kept my towel close by. 

When the instructor came in and sat down, everyone got quiet. She spoke in a soft, pleasant voice. She used words like energy, spirit, awakening, inner, and good morning. 

The first thing she had us do was make a surfer, hang loose hand gesture and then hold our noses between our thumbs and pinkies. Then we were to alternate nostrils and take deep breaths in and out of one nostril then plugging it and breathing in and out of the other one.  Despite having a little cramp in my hand, I’d give myself a solid B+ for Nostril Plug Breathing Pose. 

After making sure that we got all of the snot out of our noses (I’m guessing that’s what it was for)  we were told to get on all fours. Once we were all into Mount Me Pose we were to alternate between Cow Pose and Cat Pose. Cow Pose means you put your chest and belly down. Being of a certain body type and having gravity on my side, this particular pose was no problem. Although, the term Cow Pose does seem a bit mean. Cat Pose is where you arch your back straight up like a cat stretching in the morning sunlight. Alternating between these two poses made me look like a giant, sweaty, dryheaving cat.  I’d give myself a B- for Yaking Kitty Flow.

After Yaking Kitty Flow, we moved into Child’s Pose.  Having taught children for years now, I’d say that this name is severely inaccurate. Child’s Pose should either be having your hand out asking for candy, pointing across the room because another kid did some stupid shit, or squirming around holding your crotch. This particular pose looked like a slave bowing to their masters in old films about Egypt. We were told that if we ever need to take a break, or if anything becomes too tough then we could always revert back to Eqyptian Slave Pose. This part worried me a bit since this pose wasn’t particularly comfortable. You are supposed to have your arms stretched out in front of you praying to the sun-god, Ra, while also placing your ass on the heels of your feet. But for some reason when I try to sit on my heels, it’s like I have a forcefield preventing me from going the rest of the way down. Apparently, my muscles are pretty stubborn. So, after the 4th  attempt of bouncing  my ass at my heels and nearly rocketing forward head first into the lady in front of me, I just accepted my version of Egyptian Slave With a Floaty Ass Pose. 

Next, we did a Plank. This is the top of a push up that you just hold for about forever and a day. Once your arms start to tremble pretty hard then you get to pick up one of your feet and point it straight up in the air at the ceiling. This is pretty smart because then your body doesn’t know which pain to focus on, so you just hone in on not drooling all over yourself. Once you feel like jelly, you get to swing your leg that’s supposed to be elegantly positioned at 12 o’clock, but in all actually is chillin more towards a shaky 4-4:30, all the way up to you chest and place your foot in between your hands. Having lost all feeling in my leg, I let it swing freely. My knee struck me in the chest and my foot landed on my hand, but my arms were thankful for the extra support of holding up my pudgy torso.

From here you get to stand up in Warrior 1 Pose. You pretty much stand like Rafiki holding up Simba for all the animals in the Lion King to see. From there you do a little jig and change to Warrior 2 Pose. This one makes you look like  you are surfing a huge wave. You put both arms out and pop a super hard gangster lean to one side. You’ll know you are doing it right when it feels like your leg is being slowly sawed off at the hip joint. Your arms are also supposed to be stretched out and strongly posed at 3 and 9 o’clock. But that shit hurts. When was the last time you held your arms up longer than the few seconds it takes to get something off of a high shelf or display your enjoyment when going on a roller coaster? So, after every few seconds, I kept pretending like I had different itches all over so I could release the tension from my arms. I also wondered how many people would notice if I just dropped down to Egyptian Slave With a Floaty Ass Pose. 

Then we cooled things down a bit. We laid down and just stretched our hand above our heads in ‘the remotes behind me and I can almost get it’ pose.  After this we were told to hug our knees and rock back and forth. This one was my favorite because after all this punishment, there wasn’t anything I wanted more than to get into the fetal position and rock back and forth. 

Now that we were good and warmed up we started doing our Venice Sausage Flow  (I may have misheard her). This is where you stand up. A+. Then you touch your toes (upper shins). C-. Then, you lumber down to a trembly plank. D+. Then you do this sort of circular push up that ends with your head up and your bosom thrusted forward like The Little Mermaid coming out of the ocean. It felt like a lap dance manuever. Then you stick your butt up in the air while on all fours, then sensually rise up. Then you just rinse and repeat. I’ll be honest, I felt a bit like Magic Mike with a hard emphasis on the XL.  

The next thing we did was cross our feet and and touch our toes (knees). At this point the GF assisted me by giving me my foam block. I would’ve prefered it be about 2 feet taller, but it did help quite a bit. This was the point that I started to notice how much I smelled. And despite being super happy to be right in front of the fan, I also happened to realize that it was doing very little to keep me cooler while simultaneously wafting my stench through the whole studio. Being super nice yoga chics, they only gagged slightly. If anything, it’ll prepare them for their Indian retreats.

After that we were told to get on our bellies. Aced that one. Then we were asked to bend our legs and grab our ankles from behind. In my younger days, we called this a flying squirrel. We would do this off the diving board all the time. Apparently, time has not been friendly to my joints.  Try as I might, I was unable to grasp both of my ankles. I got one of them once, but the little bastard slipped out of my sweaty hand as I lunged at the other one. This is when the instructor came over, grabbed my nylon strap, and put me into Self-Hogtie Pose. Fucking embarrassing. It was like sitting on an airplane, struggling to fasten your seat belt, and then having everyone watch as the stewardess brings your fat ass the seat belt extender. Since I was all tangled up, I was unable to just give up and enter Egyptian Slave With a Floaty Ass Pose. I just had to fight through the pain. 

After that we were told to get the pillow out. Finally, nap time! But instead we were instructed to put it behind our butts and lift our legs straight up in the air. Determined not to get strapped up again, I fucking killed it. My legs were straight as arrows for like a minute. Let’s be real though, they would drop considerably whenever the instructor wasn’t looking. But they were straight as shit when she was. 

After a whopping 75 minutes of self-inflicted pain, we were finally able to quit. At the end everyone was given time to sit quietly and reflect. At the end of self-reflection time, or as I like to call it, “swearing that I’ll never fucking do this bullshit again” time, everybody did an Asian hand clap motion and said the name of their favorite Indian restaurant.  I tucked my tail firmly between my legs and got the fuck outta dodge.  Yoga is not for everybody. 

TLDR- Stunk up a yoga studio, and got hog-tied by my instructor for sucking at life. 

Edit- Whoa! Thanks for the GOLD X7 !!!! That's unimaginable! I feel like Scrooge McDuck!

3nnsir,non_TBI,"It's been a long time since I've been laid. Like, going on 12 months. Lots of overtime, not much money, depression, excuses yadda-yadda-yadda. So I decide that I need to end the drought by any means neccesary.

After some escort browsing (which is a lot like looking through a catalogue, turns out), I pick one that does outcalls. I spend the next few hours cleaning up, and start messaging. I put down a fake name and use a throwaway email generator. I use the name Dan.

Turns out Dan is also my upstairs neighbour's name.

I give specific instructions to text me when she gets here, and to go to the side door. I hear a lot of door bells and people arriving, turns out the folks upstairs are having a party. Then I hear a lot of confused talking. Then shouting. Turns out the escort slipped in with them and was trying to flirt with Dan. Unlike me who was slipping into absolutely nothing.

TL;DR Can't even get laid by paying for it. Accidentally sent an escort to a married man's dinner party."
45fkss,non_TBI,"Obligatory, this happened two days ago.

I work at an art gallery, and sometimes move around very expensive art pieces. Well, last week I had a terrible ear infection that gave me vertigo. I called in sick, but my boss told me I had to come in. After taking a tremendous amount of medicine, I felt alright, as long as I didn't stand, move, or breathe slightly.

My boss asked me to move a piece of art work, and I obliged because I'm an idiot. Not only did I have to move the artwork, but I had to put it up high on the wall because of the way we place our art. I had to get on a ladder and everything was fine until I started to get dizzy and dropped the canvas. The framing popped open, the glass shattered, and the canvas had a tear in it. 

I was near tears and my boss runs in and starts freaking out. Although I work in a gallery, I had no idea what was and wasn't expensive. This particular piece is worth $300k, and the artist, who is very well known, was loaning it to us.

I haven't been to work since and my boss let me go home early that day. I wish she would have just let me take the day off.

TL;DR Boss forced me to go to work, I damage $300k worth of paint.

EDIT: I haven't been to work since because I only work Monday-Wednesday. This happened on Wednesday. I haven't talked to anyone from the gallery since. 

Update: I decided to call my boss and she said she's setting up a meeting with the curator of the gallery and I should expect a reply on Monday if I still have my job. Might need to change this to TIFU by getting fired. 

Update Part 2: My co-worker just texted me and told me that the curator just got out of a meeting with the Board of Directors and they walked out of the meeting laughing. I might be safe. Maybe.

Update Part 3: I just got out of a meeting with the curator. He told me to let him know if I'm ever am sick and can't make it to work. I asked what happened to Linda (my boss). He said to wait for the employee meeting at noon to find out. RIP Linda. "
21hp6f,non_TBI,"Actually yesterday. I couldn't sleep, so I wanted to kill some time on chatroulette. I met this cute girl from Morocco (She was white, but I didn't think about it. She could've moved there later or something, right?), and one thing lead to another and she's masturbating on cam on Skype.

She says that if I don't show my dick she will delete me. I was just starting to get horny, so why not. But I was smart enough to not have my face and dick in the picture at the same time.

She lost the connection and logged on again. The first thing she does is send me a link to a youtube video. If you didn't guess it already, the video was first me on webcam with my face and then me showing my dick. The title of the video was my full name with my facebook link in the description.

If I don't give ""her"" 630 USD she will send the video to all my friends, and she listed up some of my friends on my facebook friendlist. Since I'm panicking, I get my card and empty my savings just to please him. He ended up deleting the video, but he wanted more. That's when I blocked him and he stopped. The video is not online now (at least not with my full name).

**TL;DR Showed my dick on chatroulette and got blackmailed for 630 USD**

EDIT:
I see a lot of the same questions asked over, so I thought I'd add an FAQ.

*Why exactly 630 USD, and not a round number?*

It was a round number in the original currency, but I converted it to USD since most people here are from the states and/or knows how much a dollar is worth.

*You actually paid the guy?!?!???! FUCKING IDIOT*

I was in panic, a lot of you would've done the same thing. He didn't give me a lot of time, so I didn't have time enough to think.

**I see a lot of good posts here, and good answers to what I should do. I've done everything I should to prevent the ""hacker"" from doing anything more.
And you guys really helped me calm down, and as you say the worst that'll happen is that some of my friends and family sees it. They'll forget about it sooner or later, and after a few months it'll only be a joke to us. But that would probably make it easier to track the guy too, and I think he's in way deeper shit than I am then. Thanks so much for your help!**"
3zphdl,non_TBI,"Got back home in the early hours of the morning with no key. I live in a terraced house and so usually use the back door as an entrance. So I went around the front of the house and proceeded to lift open a grate which I thought would lead into my basement. I opened the grate and slid through this really tight sloping hole. Got covered in cobwebs, the lot. When my feet touched the ground I couldn't see a thing. Pitch black. I then stumbled into something metallic, like a drum kit. I turned my phone light on. I don't own a drum kit. Shit, this isn't my house. 

At that moment my next door neighbour comes running into his basement with a baseball bat ready to knock me the fuck out.

The lights switched on and i'm just stood there with the most sorry look on my face. He laughed it off in the end but I still felt like such an idiot.

3we6l0,non_TBI,"This happened about 5 years ago while on a family vacation in Mexico. We were looking for things to do and my dad says he'll buy my brother and I a snorkeling trip for the next day. We agreed, had dinner, then me and my bro go to the bar at our resort for some drinks. My dad warns us not to get too wasted because the snorkeling trip is booked for 8am. Whatever Dad. We get to the bar, meet some girls, one thing leads to another and I get absolutely hammered off tequila shots. Blackout. Wake up to my dad knocking on the door pissed off saying to get the fuck out on the boat. 

Here's where the story begins. The rocking boat, scorching sun, and cheap tequila hangover were bad enough; then about two hours in I get the urge to explosively shit my shorts. No bathroom. I didn't want to move, but I decided taking a good ole fashion aqua-deuce is better than shitting on the deck. I grab some goggles, get in the water and swim away from the group of people. I figure I'm a good distance away, dive down a little, pull my shorts down and let loose. This was some next level shit. There's shit floating all around me, and that`s when I realize that fish fucking love shit. Tons of fish start pecking at it, and at this point some of the snorkelers are heading over since there's so many fish. I panic because I'm surrounded by my own feces so I just start wack-a-mole-ing the floating turds, trying to break them up. This causes more fish to come and more snorkelers as well. Before I know it, I'm surrounded by fish and snorkelers... and we are all swimming in my shit. In the end I'm not sure if anyone noticed my shit floating around, but it was still embarrassing as hell.

TL;DR Got wasted, went snorkeling hung over, explosively shit in the ocean causing fish and snorkelers to swim in it.

Edit: I realize all tequila is Mexican, I just meant local no-name tequila, for sure not for export. "
41l7qn,non_TBI,"So I had this idea to make an old school adventure game using the directory system on my computer. Every decision you could make would be a different folder, and each folder would then contain a few more folders to choose from. Of course, this meant making thousands of folders, many of which would be redundant, and so I decided that the best way to make it would be by writing a brief little program. My proof of concept was a hedge maze, without any decisions at each step besides North, East, South, and West; before I did that, though, I wanted to check that my code for making a large nested directory tree worked, and so I wrote up my program. And then I compiled it. And ran it.

Hagrid.java was only a few seconds into creating his hedge maze when I had the horrifying realization that I had told my computer to make a directory tree with a depth of 100, and was thus on my way to creating 4^100 nested folders. I immediately reset my computer, but by the time I had booted it up again, there were 33,315,196 folders on my desktop.

Shift-Del gave an estimated time of 12 days to delete the thing, so I just made sure it wasn't being indexed by the computer and set it as an operating system file, so I'll never have to see it again. Nobody will ever know.

But *I* know. I know that somewhere, hidden on my desktop, there are millions and millions of empty folders. :(

**Edit 4:** Thank you everyone who made suggestions on how to fix my ridiculous problem! The one that finally did the trick was 

    cd blank
    robocopy blank ""Hedge Maze"" /mir > NUL

which fixed everything in a mere five or so hours. I've also edited my previous edit to say where my background's from and give a non-compressed version.

Thanks all! You make my mistakes a joy

**Edit 2:** Yes, I tried rmdir /s /q and not just Shift-Del. The reason why I decided just to hide them all was because that was also taking a kind of preposterous amount of time. (Then again, I have the patience of a flea, so who knows...)

**Edit:** [Proof!](http://i.imgur.com/oSxqxZJ.png) Well, kinda. My earlier attempts to delete got rid of around a million files, so I guess you'll just have to take it on faith that there were 33 million and not just 32.

I asked a few nurses what the button was for, and no one seemed to know.  Naturally, I pushed it.  Nothing happened.  No lights came off or on, no secret doors opened up. I pushed it a couple of times really fast, thinking something might happen, still nothing.  So I go and sit down to continue charting.

After a long long flight through a few connections from Kuwait, my dad wakes me up telling me that the plane has landed and we take our things from the overhead compartment and wait for the signal that it is safe to leave the plane.

The signal is given and we start leaving the plane to enter JFK and head to the security point to stamp our passports.

Everything goes well and after a few questions that the immigration officer had asked my dad, his passport was stamped. 

The officer opens my passport and looks at me with a nice smile and says ""hey there... la... le... laloord. What brings you to the states?"". With a big grin on my face i say ""i come with dad"" and he replies ""and what is he here for?"" and the most fucked up thing ever come out of my mouth. Having english as my second language made me go with ""he is a terrorist"" with the grin going from ear to ear from the excitement that am speaking english to a native speaker.

Well what i meant to say if you didn't already get it is ""tourist""... 

From there on, there was no more grin. We get pulled into seperate rooms and i get asked a series of questions. I kept using the word terrorist and it didn't help at all. Someone who speaks arabic was brought and asked me what i meant when i called him that and i explained in Arabic.

He then laughed and the officer in the room looked at him wierdly. When he told the officer about the misunderstanding he laughed too. 

I get reunited with my father after a while and he told me not to speak English until i learned it properly. 

Tl;Dr: called my dad a terrorist instead of a tourist. Got pulled by airport security thinkng we were the ""Go BOOM"" type."
3mh0ji,non_TBI,"I'll try to make this quick.

Basically, I met this girl from Tinder at a bar last night. We had great chemistry and ended up staying at the bar until close. During the date, I asked if she had met up with other guys from Tinder and how those previous dates went. She explained how during her last Tinder date, after a couple of drinks the guy asked her to come back to his apartment. She said no, she wasn't like that. The guy then proceeded to convince her that ""that's not how Tinder dates work"". Long story short, she ended up leaving and didn't talk to him again.

Now, I found this hilarious so throughout the rest of the night anytime she said no to any of my questions, I would respond with ""**But that's not how Tinder dates work.**""

Me: ""You should buy me a drink?"" Her: ""You should be buying ME a drink!"" Me: ""But that's not how Tinder dates work.""

Me: ""Want to play pool?"" Her: ""No, I'm not very good."" Me: ""But that's not how Tinder dates work.""

Me: ""Want to take another shot?"" Her: ""No, I have work tomorrow."" Me: ""But that's not how Tinder dates work.""

You get the idea. Anyways, we both found this to be very funny and an easy way to lighten the conversation. It was all in good fun.

So here's the fuck up part: At the end of the night, somehow we ended up going back to my place and getting in bed together. After some kissing play, she took off my pants and started sucking my dick. After a minute of this, I couldn't resists myself and in one of my creepiest voices, I said ""**Now this is how Tinder dates work.**""

At first she started with somewhat loud dick-in-the-mouth nervous laughter. But then she stopped and couldn't believe what I just said. And then it had killed the mood so much that she ended up putting her top back on and decided to quickly leave. Leaving me laying in bed, naked, with a semi-hard, thinking about how badly I just fucked that up."
3hawvb,non_TBI,"Nope, not actually today but recent enough, my son (now 3, then 2) and I went to play in the square, had our usual jolly old run-around and all round fun time, right up until he climbed down into a ditch and then asked me to lift him out. No problem, I thought as I reached down, took hold of his wrists, and lifted him carefully, in much the same way as I've seen a thousand parents lift a thousand kids in the past, the only problem being that for some reason I fucked it up and the next thing he was screaming like he had a broken arm. Horrified at hurting my child I balled him up in my arms and carried him straight home, apologizing all the way and assuring him that daddy loved him and didn't mean to hurt him. Turned out to be a sprain, no biggy, but it was a shock nonetheless.

Anyway, cut to later that night and the discovery that a child of two is more than capable of holding a grudge and being a vindictive little bastard, because no sooner had I switched off the light and lain my head on the pillow, lying peacefully on my side with my wife and son tucked up comfortably behind me, than I felt someone move and realized my son was standing over me. I turned my head and in the half light could barely make out his eyes, cold and without feeling. He opened his jammies and I had just enough time to cry out in horror, ""No!"" before he whipped out his tally-whacker, took a very deliberate aim, and pissed all over my head.

He'd never done any such thing before, and he's never done any such thing since. It was revenge, plain and simple. And it was a dish served...warm."
3967tg,non_TBI,"I'm looking after my sister's house for a few days while she's away. Been here a couple of days and I'm settled in. It's nice and sunny outside, so I decide take the dog on a bit of a hike. It was lovely. Sun beating down, bluebells in the woods, tweeting birds - it was a proper walk in the countryside. Happy days.

Got home and I'm a bit sweaty (balls are sticking to my leg) so obviously I need to jump in the shower. ""Ahh, a nice relaxing shower"" I think to myself as I soap up and feel the hot blast of water cascading over my shoulders. Bliss.
Then I hear the dog going crazy downstairs, barking and jumping around. So I jump out of the shower and open the window to see what he's barking at. Shit, it's a courier! I completely forgot my sister told me she had some parcels coming. I quickly wrap a towel around my waist, run downstairs and head for the door.

The delivery guy spots me through the glass and waits as I calm the dog down and tell him to sit. Good dog. I open the door a crack and the dog gets a bit twitchy. ""Stay!"" I tell him, and he settles. Good boy. Your training is going well. You deserve a biscuit. I open the door to deal with the delivery.
The guy hands me a parcel, taps his touchpad a couple of times and gives it to me to sign. I stuff the parcel under one arm, take the touchpad and look for where I need to sign.

Then I hear a woman talking. Then a little girl. It's the neighbour from a couple of doors down, pushing her baby's buggy up the street and talking to her (I'm guessing) 5 year-old daughter, who occasionally plays in the garden with the pup.
The dog hears his little friend and makes a bolt for the door. But I'm too quick for him. I put my leg out to block his way. Little shit dips his shoulders and rushes between my legs, catching my towel over his head and ripping it away from my waist!

So I'm standing there, bollock naked, touchpad in one hand, parcel under one arm, my junk basking in the summer sun, shouting for the dog to stop while my brain is trying to work out what the fuck is going on! Too many things happening at once! Confusion intensifies!

Delivery bloke bursts out laughing, neighbour's eyes lock onto my man parts, jaw drops and she scrambles to cover her little girl's eyes, who's standing there staring at my sausage with a look of utter confusion/horror on her face.
I quickly drop the touchpad over the offending appendage, shuffle backwards into the house, pull the door to and gather myself as best I can. Delivery guy (who's now in tears) hands me the towel through the crack in the door and I cover myself. I sign with a X, shout the bloody dog back inside, look up and lock eyes with the neighbour again as I shamefully slink back into the living room. Then I sit holding my head in my hands for about 20 minutes.

But here's the kicker. I opened the parcel to check everything is ok with [the order](http://i.imgur.com/JsCCQWPh.jpg)

Arse!


TL;DR I answered the door in a towel and now I'm probably a sex offender. Plus irony is a bitch.

3nrh49,non_TBI,"So this actually happened a few years ago but I want to share it any way. Kinda long, sorry.

When I was in high school I took a class on graphic design (photoshop'n'shit), and we used the computers in the school which always had the default school image loaded with a shitty green background, not much on the inspiration side of things. So, everyday when I would log on, I would change the wallpaper to get the creative juices flowing, and since Im a fan of sloths (who isnt?), I decided to set it to a picture of a sloth,[Sloth Pic I used](http://imgur.com/C0m38e4). All good, I get my work done, log off, and I leave a happy man.

Until about 2 hours later, when 2 of the vice principals (VP1, VP2) pull me out of my shop class and bring me to the office. I was asking what this was all about but they wouldn't say. So I'm sitting in a chair in the back room in the office when my graphic design teacher walks in, along with a police officer and the 2 vice principals from before. At this point im thinking ""Shit Shit Shit! the fuck did I do now?!!"", I'm sweating and I look nervous as fuck because who wouldn't be? After a what seemed like forever of them just staring at me, VP1 asks in a very angry tone, ""So, you like Beavers!?"" and VP2 says ""Because we don't!"". Now at this point I'm confused as all fuck, I have no clue what they are talking about. Im just sitting there staring at them with this blank look on my face. My Graphic design teacher was looking at me with probably the most disappointed look I have ever seen. I tell them I have no idea what they are talking about but they clearly didnt believe me because they started telling me that I could be expelled for this, and that I sent a girl (student) home in tears.  They tell me that this kind of sexist behavior will not be tolerated and that I should be in counselling. I finally start to clue in as to what they are talking about and I ask them if this is all about the wallpaper I set this morning. They tell me yes and that this is very serious. I try to explain my self to these people but they aren't really believing me so I convinced them to show me this in person. We take a walk down to the class which was empty at the time, I log onto the computer and lo and behold, there is my beautiful screen saver but because of the size of monitor it had been cropped. [This is what the wallpaper looked like](http://imgur.com/mjqN05T). I actually start dying of laugher, partly because of relief but mostly because I realized their fuckup. They thought that the shoulder of the girl in the picture was a actually a crotch/womans vadge area and that the sloth was a beaver (since beaver can be used as slang for pussy). And when I logged out, since the machine was not shut down, the background remained for the next user who happened to be a very sensitive girl I guess. She was so offended that the police were called (a little extreme if you ask me).  So im sitting there explaining my self and almost dying of laughter and I made sure to show them the full image. VP1 sighed and facepalmed and VP2 muttered ""I dont have time for this crap"" and walked out. I basically just got a stern talking to by my graphic design teacher about improper use of school computers and the whole thing was let go. I still laugh at this to this day.

TL;DR 
I set my wallpaper to a sloth but teacher thought it was a beaver-pussy picture. Almost got expelled when I was just trying to be creative.

Disclaimer: This fuck up happened back in November, on my brothers birthday.

Me and my older brother live in an apartment together in Toronto. His wife goes to college in New York. It's not TOO far of a drive, but definitely not close enough to travel to often. Because of this, he doesn't see her in person very often, but they skype each other for hours every night. In November, it was my brothers birthday and his wife decided to take a week off school to come visit and celebrate his birthday with him. 

A couple days before his birthday, my brother told me to go stay with a friend for the day because he wanted to dedicate the day to just ""chilling"" with his wife. Fair enough. I planned with a friend to stay with him for a couple days.

On the morning of his birthday, while he was still asleep, so I left him a little birthday present. We have a board in the kitchen where we pin stuff like bills, so I left him a note that said ""happy birthday big bro, have fun"" and I also pinned a condom and a $50 bill to the board. And as a joke, put 3 thumbtacks through the condom. My brothers a smart dude, so I figured he would see the condom has 3 thumbtacks, laugh, and throw it away. I thought wrong.

I leave for my friends house and everything goes as normal. I sleep over at my friends, come back home a couple days later, and celebrate my brothers birth week.

A little over a month later, on Christmas Day, my parents are over, and my brother makes an announcement. He tells us all that he is moving to Buffalo to live with his wife, who is now pregnant. Knowing my brother, I knew that he didn't want to have kids until he was at least 40, so after the announcement I pull him aside to congratulate him and ask for details. He tells me that the baby wasn't planned, and that when he had sex with his wife on his birthday, the condom broke. 

I explain the whole thing to him, and to my surprise, he actually laughed. He wasn't angry at all. After finding out his wife was pregnant, he realized that deep down he really wanted a kid, and didn't realize it. Now, his wife has a baby on the way, he is moving to New York next month, and I gotta find a new roommate to help pay rent.



TL:DR 

~~Got my bro a condom that was shitty~~

~~Now he's moving to the big city~~

(since Buffalo isn't the big city, here's a more accurate TL:DR)

Gave a broken condom to my bro

Now he's gonna move to Buffalo



"
2qliev,non_TBI,"I originally posted this story Thursday night, but eventually ran into Rule 11. So before I give an update, here’s the original story. I’m not unable to sleep and typing on an ipad anymore, so I took the time to clean up what had been a stream of consciousness. People complained about my use of first initials rather than pseudonyms, so I fixed that (A is now Angie, H = Heather, L = Lena if anyone wouldn’t have picked up on that.

EDIT: I've been narrated! Big thanks to /u/Cyae1

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfCrRIAwZC4

Original Story (Christmas Night):

This TIFU is still developing, but requires a little backstory first. I've been working at my company for the past year, it's my first job out of college. Additionally, my office is blessed with a surprisingly high number of attractive women for a tech company (most of them were business majors, but I’ll take it). I've become very close friends with one of them, Angie.

It took me less than a month of working with Angie before I was convinced she was the girl of my dreams. Being the new guy and having to directly work with her daily I never tried to be more than friends in fear of the situation if she said no. She moved to a different team in June so we rarely see each other during work anymore. Angie got engaged in July. When discussing it with her I made a comment to the extent of ""I'm happy for you but sad that we never got to try 'us'."" I was drunk and knew it was a fuck up immediately but I was glad to have it off my chest.

We didn't talk for a few days and then I got a text inviting me out for drinks like a normal Friday night and both went on like I never said it. Fast forward to October and she catches her fiancé with an ex. Angie is no longer engaged. She came to me crying and we just sat on my porch drinking for the night. She tells me she is done dating for a while. I recognized then that I loved her as my best friend and just held her for a few hours. We started spending a lot more time together, but it was always just as friends.

So that sets up my relationship with Angie. Other coworkers you need to know: Heather and Lena. They’ve been best friends since college and Angie has kind of joined their little circle. Both of them are attractive but I've spent the past year unable to get Angie out of my mind (I'm forever the romantic, fuck me). I’m “friends” with them to the extent that they go out drinking with Angie and me regularly, but I don’t really talk to them much during the week. 

Now for our company's Holiday party on December 6th.

My company is a work hard, party harder company. The amount of alcohol we drink is insane for the corporate world, with over 2000 drinks served for ~320 people before the after-party.  I went alone to the party and so did Angie. We got drinking and midway through the party she gives me a quick kiss in front of Heather and Lena. The kiss throws me completely off as I'm now wrestling with feelings I thought I had tamed while being afraid of taking advantage of her since she was still upset about the breakup. The trio starts giggling and I’m thinking that that kiss might just be something Heather and Lena tease me about on Monday.

The night continues and the four of us share a cab to the after-party. Angie sits on my lap for the cab ride and kisses me again. I was hard under her leg for the rest of the ride and only got a couple winks from her as acknowledgement of it. Getting out of the cab Angie whispers in my ear ""neither of us are going home alone tonight, but first we party"".  My three companions all go towards the restroom and I make a beeline for the open bar and swap over to vodka red bull to drown what’s left of my inhibitions; I'm going home with the girl of my dreams tonight. Oh how I wish we had just dropped off Heather and Lena and gone to my place then.

With a few vodka red bulls and Angie’s comment replaying in my mind, they were able to coax me onto the dance floor. I know I can't dance so I actively avoid the dance floor. Apparently I could dance that night though. Spending the time on the dance floor allowed me to sober up enough to realize Lena is dancing on me almost as much as Angie. I decided to stop drinking then so that a) I could remember everything from this night and b) I wasn't going to underperform for Angie. If only I had kept drinking.

Getting a straight red bull from the bar when I go to grab the girls more, I returned to the dance floor to see them dancing together in a way that I will never be able to want to forget. I step back and watch for a few minutes. Oh how I wish I had rushed back out there with their drinks.

While watching, I see Heather kiss Lena. I knew Heather was bi, but I never thought about Lena. Heather then kisses Angie and I damn near dropped the drinks. I believe I operated with a low blood supply for organs above my belt for the rest of the night. When I get to them with their drinks, Heather downs hers and kisses me. I thought it was going to ruin everything between me and Angie until Angie ran her hand across my arm and I saw she didn't object. I'm now convinced I'll never have a better night than tonight. I pull away and suggest to Angie we say our goodbyes, meet outside, and head back to my place. I knew what I was hoping for but only expected Angie to join me. My life would be so much easier if I did not get what I had been hoping for.

I say goodbye to a few important people and head outside to hail a cab. Angie is standing there with Heather and winks at me again right before Lena grabs my ass and joins us. I get us a cab and again Angie is in my lap. I get more than a wink this time as she wouldn't sit still and was effectively giving me a lap dance for the short ride home with constant eye contact. I think Heather and Lena were making out but I wasn't paying attention to anyone other than Angie. I don't know how that cab ride could have gone differently, but I wish they would've fallen asleep or something before getting to my place.

We get to my place, Heather and Lena move to my couch as Angie and I are tearing each other's clothes off on the way upstairs to my bed. Why couldn't I have locked my door...

I'm on top of Angie when I feel extra hands touch my back. Raw excitement and realizing that I didn’t misread any of the earlier cues cost me my condom. My last condom. Angie whispers that she's on the pill and it’s game on for a foursome I'll forever cherish and regret.

The next morning, I wake up with 3 beautiful women in my bed and I felt like a Greek god for the first time in my life. After brunch, Heather and Lena both kiss me goodbye and get into a cab. Once they had left, Angie kisses me and returns us to they had so rudely interrupted the night before...

Angie and I have been dating since that night and she is everything I imagined her to be. I've spent most of December thinking I'm the luckiest guy on the planet. I got girl of my dreams and it got serious after a four-way. While most of the office now knows Angie and I are dating, almost no one knows the true events of that night so it hasn't really changed anything at the office. I’ve been talking to Heather and Lena more often though.

Fast forward to Tuesday. Angie and I are driving to my parents for Christmas (we went to hers for Hanukkah) when I get a distressed call from Heather over Bluetooth so Angie is part of the conversation too.

Heather is pregnant.
I'm the only man she's been with this year, so she hasn’t been taking the pill. Fuck. Angie is the first to start crying and I pull over before I am tempted to take the car into incoming traffic. We sit there and talk for a half hour before cooler heads prevail and we agree that Angie and I will leave early and be back early Friday. We'd have turned around immediately but keeping my parents oblivious will make it so much easier. Angie and I talk for the remaining hour of the drive and she says she's not mad at me since the four-way was her idea and we'll get through this. My parents pick up that I was stressed, but we manage to pass it off as stress from corporate politics.

Then there's today. Christmas. I get a call from Lena when I'm out alone with the dogs.
Lena is pregnant.
She doesn't know about Heather or at least doesn't mention it. What she does do is confess that she's in love with me and wants to keep it. She wants me to leave Angie and marry her before the baby starts showing or she's going to claim I forced myself onto her while she was passed out at my place.

I talk to Angie and she's in tears again. She hugs me and keeps saying we’ll get through this. I bring in my uncle (also my lawyer) to address her threat and says so long as Heather tells my side of story I'll be fine but we need to tell HR everything first thing Monday. Angie was holding my arm crying into my shoulder the whole time but she agreed. 

The last 48 hours has been an emotional roller coaster and it doesn't look to be ending anytime soon.

P.S. No, I didn't bat 3/3, let's just say I didn't enjoy Hanukkah as much as I wanted to.

TL;DR: Corporate Holiday party. Infatuated with beautiful coworker who has two hot friends who are also coworkers. Lots of alcohol. Four-way. Ran out of condoms. Start dating the girl of my dreams. Find out I impregnated both of her hot friends. One of them is crazy.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Additional info, most of which was posted in comments of the old thread:
 
* Yes, Angie’s ass is Kate good.
* Mentally, I heard Angie telling me she was on the pill to mean they all were. She thought they were too.
* My best friend bought a pregnancy test and took it to Heather on Tuesday, it was positive.
* Heather was supposed to start her period on the 10th, she had been taking tests since the 12th and first tested positive on the 22nd, she called me when she tested positive the morning of the 23rd.
* I went to the doctor on the 19th, I need to check up with him again next month, but I got a clean bill of health.
* I came 3 times: in the condom, in Angie, and on Heather’s stomach. I apparently pulled out late on the last one.
* On the last one, Lena had pushed me into her quickly afterwards. I had thought she was just trying to keep the party going. My mortality caused me to tap out shortly into round 4.
* None of them are supermodels, but Angie gets a solid 9 and the other two are both 7.5+.
* The foursome was a result of Heather joking about it on that bathroom trip and then Angie convincing them to make it more than a joke. According to Angie, Heather’s made the joke before.
* Heather is business-side while I’m a developer, but she would be my superior if we were on the same team. It can be assumed she makes more than I do.
* Lena is in accounting. I have no idea what she makes.
* Angie tried to talk to Lena yesterday. She hung up when Lena started shouting at her.
* For what it’s worth, I’m 24, Angie is 23, both Heather and Lena are 26.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also want to include the comment that made me laugh the hardest on the last post:

By /u/moshisimo
>A and I are driving to my parents for Christmas

I? Who the fuck is I? When was I introduced??? Oh... never mind...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 1: On Friday, Angie and I talked to Heather upon getting back in town. She doesn’t want to keep the child, though she is going to ask her older sister if her and her husband want to adopt it. Her sister is infertile due to complications from her first child. If they say no, she’s going to terminate the pregnancy. She doesn’t expect assistance from me with either option, though I volunteered to pay for the termination if that’s where it goes.
 
She hadn’t talked to Lena but is appalled by her threat. Apparently Lena’s parents have been pressuring her to settle down and have kids while she’s young. Her family is very religious and will likely disown her for having a child outside of marriage. Heather told us that Lena has had a crush on me for months, I was just too obsessed with Angie to see it. She’s been upset about Angie and I being together. Her self-image took a hit when I was unable to keep going while in her (It was round four damn it!). I was the first man she had ever not used a condom with and she blames Heather for convincing her to do it.
 
Heather volunteered to talk to her as I wouldn’t be able to calm down Lena without a ring.
 
Update 2: Angie accompanied Heather to the doctor Friday afternoon for a blood test. They got the results early this morning. Heather is definitely pregnant. She’s going to wait a month to make sure there are no issues before making the offer to her sister. For now, all quiet on the western front.
 
Update 3: Heather talked to Lena. It didn’t go well. At least Heather recorded it.
 
Lena did get a positive result on the pregnancy test that Heather brought with her. Heather watched and knows it wasn’t tampered with. Fuck.
 
Lena is maintaining that I would be far happier with her than I would be with Angie. She said that we’re destined for each other and the baby proved it.
 
When confronted about the threat, she turned on Heather. She was yelling at Heather for how much she drank that night and pressuring her into joining the foursome knowing her feelings about me.  

When Heather informed Lena that she was also pregnant from that night and was considering an abortion, Lena went full holier-than-thou and likely ended their friendship with some of the comments made. The conversation ended there with the situation involving Lena infinitely worse now that Heather can't talk to her either.

-----------------------------------------------------
UPDATE 4: Angie heard me listening to the narration again. She's now reading the comments. So far, she's said I shouldn't have posted this, but y'all are making her laugh, so I should be ok.

-----------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 5: A coworker just text me ""For Frodo!"" Tomorrow is going to suck. He's enough of a friend that it won't be break room gossip, but I'm now considering who else could connect the dots.
Update 5.1: I'm removing a couple comments because of this. He said he only made the connection because he saw Heather kiss me, but I'm still going to cover my ass on this one. None of the comments I'm removing include stuff that happened that night.

-----------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 6: I have assholes for coworkers that are on reddit. I a four boxes of condoms were on my desk when I got in this morning. I'm lucky that I got in earlier than my boss. Other than a few ""For Frodo!"" calls, there wasn't anything else said to my face. Thankfully they've spared Angie so far.

Update 7: Talking to HR wasn't as bad as expected. Angie and I went to them as soon as they got in. They let us talk, it was mostly me exempt for the parts where I wasn't there like the restroom trip. We actually did manage some laughs from the guys in HR, one of them had actually read this TIFU. He said that I stopped short of identifying the company so posting this doesn't add to my situation. There is a good chance all four of us will end up on probation, but if we can keep it civil and avoid additional fuckups, we should be ok. 

They talked to Heather and Lena individually. Lena went home for the day afterwards and I don't know any more details about her. Angie has been talking to Heather since she got home. Apparently she was told similar things by HR, though the responsibility talk from one of her bosses was apparently very awkward.

Reposting the TL;DR For those that are going to try to go straight to it.

2smpm8,non_TBI,"Last night I was at the bar and ended up bringing a girl back to my place. We hooked up for a while and when it was eventually over we both begin to fall asleep. After a little silence she leans over and asks, ""do you reddit?"" A little drunk, a little tired, and really surprised a girl like her would be into reddit I reply with an enthusiastic, ""Yes! Do you?"" the only problem is she didn't ask if I reddit, she asked if I ""regret it"" as in regretted hooking up with her and my enthusiastic ""yes"" was not the answer she was looking for. She responded with an angry ""Fuck you"", got dressed and stormed out before I could put two and two together. "
44u4j5,non_TBI,"My pasta was too hot to eat so I decided to blow on it. Then I saw my can of compressed air sitting on my desk. I now have pasta all over myself, the floor, and the walls. I am not a smart man. "
2xox4r,non_TBI,"You know those little things your parents told you as a child that you always just took as truth because they never got questioned? Well one bit me in the ass yesterday. 

I am studying abroad in Paris this year. It's already been a semester and I am having the time of my life. I have been trying to learn and practice my French while I am here because, well when in Rome...

Anyways I was feeling a little homesick the other day, missing my parents but my mom especially. Then a great idea hit me. She always used to make me this French dish for breakfast when I was young. It was basically an egg on toast. I think it's a pretty common thing? Well she always called it ""mer-dwa-so"" which I always just assumed meant ""egg on toast"" or some shit in French. Maybe I just assumed that was the name of the dish, like it didn't translate to anything. I guess I never really thought about it at all. Big mistake. 

I figured to myself ""hell this must be a French dish, and it will remind me of home. I'm going to go order it.""

So I went into a little café around from where I am staying and I went up to the lady, and in French asked her if they had any mer-dwa-so

You should have seen the look on her face. She basically just stared at me in disbelief and said what?

So I repeated it. 3 times. Until I realized that I was saying ""merde d'oiseaux"" which is literally bird shit. 

I left with no egg and toast. I called my mom and she explained to me, In-between fits of laughter, that they made that name up because it kind of looks like bird poop, spattered on a windshield (the toast). She said they translated it to French because it ""sounded fancier and because you can't say ""bird shit"" to a child every day.""

Thanks mom. That's one less café I can show my face in.  "
3v75o0,non_TBI,"So I took the time to prepare a romantic, candle-lit place. It was beautiful, with heart-shaped balloons, red and white roses everywhere, candles everywhere, made her favorite meal, made a mixtape with our favorite songs...anything a girl wants in a relationship right? (even though not all girls - hold on) 



It was soo romantic, spent half of my paycheck to rent the place and prep everything. I was so excited to see her reaction and my heart was going wild. It is my first time ever doing this, so I did my best, but it was all damn beautiful!



So she gets led to the place by her sister, she lied to her that there was bday party of another friend of her. She arrived, read the card I prepared and she had misty eyes. Then the door opened, she saw me in the candle lit room with my tux - romantic as fuck - music was playing, I invited her for a dance. She was really happy!



Everything went as planned...dinner, dance, music... she was excited and happy, didn't know what to say etc. Then I proposed and she said YES!



BUT WAIT, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE! SINCE YOU KNOW SHE IS A WOMEN AND COMES FROM ANOTHER PLANET!



The next day she said she was not happy with the way I proposed, a romantic night with each other is what she apparently didn't want! She wanted me to call her friends and surprise her with them! We argued a lot, she appreciated my efforts but didn't like it all. And I said that she apparently loves her friends more than me, she said that it isn't true, but it came out like that! She said I was being selfish by doing it ""my way"" and not how she imagined it! 



TL;DR: Apparently you should propose the way the girl wants it :(

Edit: I took the night off to consider stuff. Feeling heartbroken atm... Didnt sleep at all and gotta go to work. Feeling shitty atm. Oh and this girl is someone i knew a long time, same neighborhood etc. She was a good girl.with.whom we hung out a lot. This reaction of her was a complete other side of her eventhough we knew each other very good... Apparently not. Most of our common friends took my side...

Update: She isnt a redditor but apparentl she got linked this thread and said she didnt know she hurt my feelings. Like... Seriously... Being a man doesnt come with feelings? Gotta rethink all of this... Thanks for support guys and girls :( the reality checkers are right. I am gonna talk about this with her. 


Update2: She sent me my favorite pizza to my work. I am in a lunchbreak atm. I will eat the pizza but wont return her calls/messages...


Update3: A girlfriend of hers called me and said she wanted to be surprised in front of her friends. Apparently a few friends of her got a proposal akin to that... And my gf wanted the same.... And no she didn't mention it once that she wanted one like that, and she knows i am more a romantic guy that likes to be alone with her because of intimacy... She said it wasn't a proposal she dreamt of and that I don't respect her dreams and/or wishes and that I am selfish...

Well this is from her friend... I'm gonna leave work in a couple of hours... I will talk about this with her, no need to run away (atm tho)


**UPDATE4: SHE JUST COUNTER-PROPOSED TO ME, HOLY SHIT! Shge was waiting for me at home and she made it all romantic and shit, she cried when I arrived, apologized and said if I wanted to marry her!!!**

**I am feeling strange things atm**

**I SAID NO, I AM NOT READY YET, I NEED TIME TO TRULY UNDERSTAND YOU**

she said ""ok"" and went to bed.

Hold me reddit, i'm on a strange roller coaster 


Update5: We had a serious conversation. Instead of hurting each other we had a good breakfast talk. She said it was the first time someone proposed to her... It was mmy first time too. Sshe acknowledges it was a surpirsa and a shock for her. I told her I was the one that got hurt a lot. We are still together. We are trying to fix things our way...."
283m4x,non_TBI,"So a bit of a backstory, I'm 29 and have had a slight case of Tourette's since I was about 14, nothing too serious, I can usually keep a lid on it but I slip up every now and then, mostly when I'm nervous or stressed. Anyway, my wife and I just finished moving across the country for her job and made a trip to Florida this year to see our parents for father's day. I'm currently still looking for a job and my wife's dad has never really cared much for me. So we arrive at her parents house for dinner and the topic of me being a house-husband comes up. Here's how the convo went.

Father in law: ""So with all this time at home, you must be getting a lot of work done in the house, right?""

Me: ""Well I'm not very good at carpentry, so we're hiring someone to do the bathroom and porch.""

Father in law: ""Well then, that must give you a lot of time to keep the cars in good shape and well kept, right?""

Me: ""Honestly, I'm not great with cars either, so we just stick to mechanics for that stuff.""

Father in law: ""Well jeez, is there anything you do well?""

Me (thinking to myself): ""Don't say 'fuck your daughter', don't say 'fuck your daughter...' ""

Me: ""Fuck your daughter."" (Nnnnnnoooooooooo!!)

Her dad immediately got up and left the room without saying a word. I apologized later and he understood that I really couldn't help it. My wife thought it was the funniest moment of her life, possibly the most embarrassing for me. 

TL;DR: I told my father in law that the only thing I do well is fuck his daughter."
3s3pcw,non_TBI,"So like a lot of people on TIFU this fuck up did not happen to me today, rather it happened quite a long time ago when I was eleven. I was a nerdy kid and in my first year of middle school I got picked on. Nothing too crazy, but it affected my self esteem for sure. What made matters worse for me was this girl in my year, lets call her Beth, had a crush on me. Beth was a little off, more than a little off really and she was very vocal and persistent about her feelings for me. I really wanted her to stop, but eleven year old me couldn't muster up the courage to just tell her that all I wanted was for her to leave me alone. I tried to drop hints, be passively shitty to her, avoid her at all costs, but she was not picking up what I was laying down. Well one day me and Beth are in the first period math we share together. Beth's sitting next to me and I'm doing my best to ignore her and do my math homework. Beth, incensed by this, reaches over and starts tugging on my mechanical pencil. Now it's early, I'm not a morning person and I'm pretty done with Beth's shit so I start trying to yank the pencil out of Beth's grasp. Remember how I said Beth was persistent? She refuses to lose this tug of war and we start yanking this pencil back and forth until i decide to just...let go. Big mistake. Beth stab's herself right in the goddamn face, the eyebrow to be specific. The blood came pretty quick and Beth starts screaming ""HE STABBED ME."" The teacher comes over ,whisks Beth to the nurses office,  and tells me to ""Stay RIGHT there."" The intervening five minutes between the Teachers departure and return were some of the worst of my young life. The whole class is whispering and pointing and laughing. All i can think is about my fathers reaction when he gets word that I stabbed a girl in the face and how no one is going to buy that I only kinda sorta stabbed her. The teacher returns and begins to write the angriest looking referral I've ever seen in my entire life when another teacher enters the room and tells her to turn on the T.V. The first plane had hit the towers, the newscasters are saying it must have been an accident and then boom the second plane hits. It's 9 fucking 11. I'll be honest I thought ""Oh GOOD."" They forgot all about me. I didn't even get a referral. 

TL;DR Accidentaly stabbed a girl in the face, saved from punishment by Osama Bin Laden

Edit- Wow this blew up. A few things I wanted to address. First, thank you for the gold kind stranger... I will spend it on drugs. Second to the people asking if I ever saw Beth again, the answer is yes. I never saw her again in middle school but two years ago I was working at a pizza joint. I come in from a delivery and I sign in at the computer and on the list of drivers names is Beth. I look around and there at the cut table is a girl who looks very familiar staring at me. I dip the fuck out and manage to avoid her for roughly a week until she finally corners me. ""Do you remember me?"" she asks ""YES OH MY GOD I AM SO SORRY"" I reply. ""They forgot all about me"" she says ""They left me alone in the nurses office for hours. I still have a scar on my eyebrow."" I apologize again, she forgives me, then two days later breaks her arm in a car accident. Finally to all those asking if this is fake allow me to respond https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKo-E9IxzPw."
2spnzg,non_TBI,"A few days ago, I read a joke on Reddit. The way I interpreted it (completely literally), it was slightly inappropriate, but still amusing. 

In a rare attempt to be the ""cool mom"", I decided to share it with my kids (14 and 10) on the way to school. 

Me: Hey kids, I have a funny, but slightly inappropriate joke. Think you can handle it? Haha. 

Both rolled their eyes since my jokes are generally of the benign Dad variety. 

Me: Why did Barbie never have kids? 

Blank stares. 

Me: Because Ken came in *(my brain: oh shit, I get it now, punch out,  punch out, PUNCH OUT!)* a different... (mumble) box... 

Cue shocked, disgusted look from the 14 year old and utter confusion from the 10 year old. I tried to play it off,   without success. 

I think I'll stick with the silly dad puns from now on. "
3xyufp,non_TBI,"I have a similar story to a recent post here, but not quite as long as a 29 year one. Also this was not today. My name is Samuel, but until I was about 10 I didn't realise this. Everyone had called me Sam all my life and that's how I had learned to write my name. One day in primary school I was looking at the list of the class's names in the wall (to have stickers and stuff put next too if we had done well in something) and couldn't find my one. I did however see the name Samuel and started laughing as I had read it as if it was pronounced ""Samool"" and was looking around for the poor fucknuckle with that name. 

Tl;dr I didn't realise my name was Samuel instead of just Sam. Thought there was a kid in my class called Samool and felt bad for them.


Edit: man this blew up haha. My only proper post I've ever made and it hits front page! Also rip inbox :)

43s69o,non_TBI,"...to fucking Harvard.

So, I found out I fucked up about an hour ago. My mom had to tell me because I'm such a fucking idiot. I was all excited about finishing my application, so I sent it to her. I'm applying for a position in this neurogenetics lab at Harvard Medical School. I spent all weekend and most of today finalizing my CV and cover letter. There were some formatting issues, I think because of the downloaded font I was using, which made the document on my computer look different than the emailed version. Because of this, I didn't see that my highly profane, stream of consciousness, sorta high ramblings from last week (rough drafts), were still on the page, yet to be deleted..the kind of rough drafts that you never fucking show anybody-especially your extremely Christian mother and Dr. Person from Harvard Medical School. 

But, because I'm an idiot and didn't notice the extra pages at the bottom of my screen, Dr. Person will likely not be choosing me as his next lab technician. I'll post some of the finer points below here in a second.

**TL;DR: sent my dream job's boss my notes - including ""science is all around us,""- and other super insightful shit.**

------------------------------------------------------------------
My girlfriend's favorite bit: ""My main goal in life is to be sciencing for a long time. Specifically as a neuroscientist. However, the exact place I’ll be working/what I’ll be doing remains to be seen. Maybe research it like this, maybe like that. I feel as though I am good at science and want to do science. So, it seems like a good match.""

Another: ""Also, I know that a lot of the science in the brain is controlled by genes. You likes genes. So, it seems like a good match. You should hire me. I really want this job. I really want to go to Hahvad.""

Fuck me: ""My time working with Dr. [advisor] has been hella helpful. I’ve learned a lot about lab work, responsibility, integrity, integration, synergy, widescale growth, etc…working with others, meeting deadlines…something focus. Also while working as his lab TA I learned hella shit about helping people. I’m super nice, wanted to be a teacher and shit.
Plus im fast and I like skateboards. And I know lots about science.chemistry, biology, information, swag. Also I’m the founding vice president of the [school] Neuroscience Club.""

IV: ""I am fascinated with understanding higher level cognitive areas in terms of their molecular underpinnings – including genetics, shit. Wondering if we gonna need some computational neuroscience up in this bitch. Particularly interested in consciousness and attempting to characterize it in terms of its molecular, circuit foundations. memory, language, and shit about.""

-------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: Thanks to the person that gave me gold! I'm not sure what to do with it, but it makes me feel cool, so thanks! Also, I followed-up on my fuck up with Dr. Person: 

Hello Dr. Person,
There seems to be a problem with the previous cover letter I sent you. I, embarrassingly, did not notice that my notes were underneath the salutation. The formatting on my computer looked different than the attachment I sent you, so I did not notice any writing after my intended email. I apologize for the profanity and lack of substance. Please find my CV also attached for convenience.
My apologies again,
dougandskeeter

------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT2: Thanks for all of the replies everyone. I am glad that a lot of you got a laugh out of my story and am equally glad for all of the helpful advice I've received (e.g. always use fucking Times New Roman, always save it as a PDF, don't be a fucking idiot). No reply from Dr. Person yet, but he's probably still busy talking with the Dean of Scienc about what kind of medal to award me. I gotta go ace my scienc quiz now. Hope everybody has a good day.

------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT3: Hey interested people, I'm sorry but Dr. Person hasn't responded yet. If he does, I promise to let you all know. In the meantime, I've spent some time updating both my CV and cover letters and have heeded a lot of the advice I've received- sent that shit out in PDF format and got some standard (*boring) fonts up in those bitches. I applied to a couple of positions today and figure that the result has to be more positive than this fuck up's. Thank you all for your criticism, even the people that assumed that I'm not cut out for this field. I know I'm capable of better things, but sometimes I just fuck up. It's frustrating and makes me want to cry sometimes. But, I'm fucking back, baby! And, this train is on a one-way ticket to Downtown Coolsville - Population: Me (and gf). Happy Friday everybody. I'll let you know if anything interesting happens."
2h7cnd,non_TBI,"A kid on the bus makes a funny face at me so I make a funny face back. We're stuck in traffic so we get into a little contest and exchange funny faces for the next while. 
The kid is an amateur, he just keeps pulling the same face. I've got an arsenal full of funny faces so naturally I crush him and win the battle. I scan the rest of the bus in search of a more worthy opponent however I meet eyes with an elderly lady. 
Her facial expression looks like she has just found out there's been a death in the family and I'm the one responsible. I can see the raging storm of anger welling up inside of her. Her beady eyes are so focused on mine, I swear I can feel my pupils searing under the intensity of her glare so I break eye contact and look back at my buddy. 
To my horror, only then do I realise that the child was never making a funny face at me. He is disabled.

"
3ohpy0,non_TBI,"This actually happened this past weekend. My wife's friend came over to our house to hang out and she brought her 3-year-old son to play with our 3-year-old daughter. The adults chatted in the living room while the kids were in the playroom next to us.

My daughter loves to pretend to be different animals and mimic their sounds and movements. For example, she'll say, ""I'm and horse"" and run around saying, ""neigh, neigh"" while trotting about. Well, she runs to where we are sitting and does just that. I say, ""Well I'm an lion"" and the I start making roaring sounds. Shortly after our friend's son runs in and starts making what sounds like, ""meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.""  

I wasn't quite sure what he was pretending to be so I said, ""Are you a goat?"" The kids just laugh and run back to where they were playing so I think nothing of it. As I turn around, I see my wife giving me a very hard glare. I'm not really sure why so I just shrug it off figuring she thought I was just acting immature in front of our guest.

After our friend and her kid leave, my wife tells me our friend's son has a speech impediment. He stutters when trying to talk. The sound he was making was him trying to say something, not an animal sound.

TL:DR - I made fun of a 3-year-old for stuttering."
3whvqu,non_TBI," Tuesday I fucked up by posting this story without reading the sidebar. Sorry. But alas, it's the weekend and anything goes, so I'm reposting it.



 Today I fucked up big. Oh man, where to begin. It all happened so fast, and fell apart so early. I'll start by saying I've been single for about two years now. I settled down early, at 14, and then spent the next 20 years with the same chick. Since she left, I've been forced to rediscover myself as an individual. I'll get to the point. The one thing I actually enjoy about being single is the fact that I can fart whenever and however loud I want. I want to fart on my kids? No problem. I want to Dutch oven myself? Absolutely, smells great. I want to hard fart on the couch? Please do.


Two a.m. last night seven year old daughter, Grace, has a nightmare and joins me in my bed. Six a.m. Half asleep and I make perhaps the worst decision of my life. I should mention here that I get the occasional bout of constipation. Yesterday was day four so I decided to take a laxative to ease things along a bit. The instructions said take between one and three for ""natural relief"". Six p.m. last night I took the three and waited for my ""natural relief"". Back to six a.m. Grace is the big spoon and I feel a hard fart coming on. Half way between consciousness and slumber I push a hard one out. I feel a HOT, not warm, hot, and wet, liquid THEW shoot out of me. Grace comes to and is covered from mid chest to knees in hot yellowish daddy shart. It shot clear through my pajamas. She wipes the sand out of her eyes and you can see it clicking on her head. She glances down and looks like she just found her pet’s decapitated head next to her. She immediately starts screaming. Her screams turn to tears as she stands up in the middle of my bed, dripping dad's colon sludge. She's screaming and crying, I'm apologizing and crying. All of this wakes up the five year old boy. He groggily stumbles into the bedroom and when he realizes what's happening, proceeds to full-on bend-over guffaw. I'm now holding my still exploding ass, Grace is losing it on my bed, and the boy can barely breathe as I make my way towards the bathroom. I get to the door where my son is, and before I can waddle past him, I notice his pants are wet. This boy laughed so hard, and on a count of the early hour, he pissed himself. ""David, you're pissin yourself!"" I scream ironically, whilst holding my shit filled jammies. He responds by laughing harder, falling on the floor, curling up into the fetal position, and continuing to empty his bladder. I'm in tears and covered in shit, Grace is in tears covered in shit, David is laughing hysterically in a pool of his own piss, and the dog starts to bark. My oldest daughter is home sick from school and wakes up in the commotion, and is now watching all of this like a horrified deer caught in the headlights. 90 minutes later, David has finally calmed down, everyone has showered and it's fucking silent as I try to feed them breakfast. A quiet ride to school an hour late and we have to stop by the office to get a note. The attendance secretary asks David why he's late and he busts out laughing again. Grace looks at me and screams “don't tell them anything"", and goes tearing down the hall towards her class. It takes another three solid minutes to calm David down. I'm sure he went right in to class and told everyone. Grace hasn't said a word to me or made any eye contact with me since this morning. I think I may have really damaged her. I don't know if I can somehow blame all this on being a single dad to garner some sympathy, but I'll try. I'd hard being a single dad; even harder to look your daughter in the eyes after shitting on her. Ok, now comes the really bad part. Today is Grace's eighth birthday.





UPDATE: Grace said nothing to me on Tuesday, didn't look at me either. I gave her space and she kept to herself. Not her brother or sister, she didn't even want anything to do with the pets. The kids go with their mom on Wednesdays and I pick them up from school again Fridays. Since her birthday fell on a week day, we’re celebrating it this weekend and I need to make this one count.


 Thursday morning I get a phone call from her mother that wakes me up. I'm sleeping on the floor as my mattress is in the backyard waiting for a truck to take it to the dump. I can't tell you how much I dreaded answering that call. This is not going to be a positive conversation. I answer the phone to a good four seconds of silence.


“Hello?”


One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand.


“WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU LET SARTRE SLEEP IN YOUR BED TO SHIT ALL OVER OUR DAUGHTER ON HER FUCKING BIRTHDAY, ASSHOLE!!!?”


Wait, what? Did Grace lie to her mother or does she actually believe that the dog did this to us? Is her little eight year old brain too naive to comprehend her daddy sharting all over her? I mean it was early. It was a confusing fucking mess, but could she have been that confused? I never said I shit on her, just apologized. I thought it was obvious.  Maybe she thinks I was apologizing for letting the dog sleep in the bed.  My mind is racing as the ex continues to ream me.  Perhaps that’s why Grace didn’t want anything to do with the dog and ignored everyone. I apologize to the ex, and she finishes up yelling at me as I explain that I didn’t even know Sartre was sick and maybe that’s why he jumped into bed, to let me know he was sick. (Is this working, is Graces mom actually buying this shit? Am I actually getting away with this? All of this rushes through my head as I put forth the sick dog hypothesis.) I picked up Grace today from school. She seems o.k. She’s talked to me a little. Just demands though, “I’m hungry,” “can we change the channel?” that sort of thing. I don’t dare push the subject too hard, (after all, pushing got me into this predicament in the first place), but I’m kinda dying to know if she knows that it was me. How do you broach that subject with someone? Should I count my blessings and let it go? Do I just sacrifice the dog like that; Sartre taking one for the team, literally not existentially? The existence of the shit precedes the essence of my guilt, or something like that.  Maybe I’ll just save the ‘I shit on you on your eighth birthday’ bombshell for her 18th birthday. Fucking parenthood, huh?
   

Edit: tl;dr. I woke up this morning and covered my seven, now eight year old in a hard shart.

44etk6,non_TBI,"My wife and I have a 3 year old son who we love dearly. We often talk about how cool it would be if he were a twin. Then we could have two of them! So I offhandedly told her that in a parallel universe, it’s likely we have died and our son is alive. If we could just figure out a way to get him from his universe to ours, everyone wins. She’s been crying for two hours now over our parent-less son in another universe. And I haven’t even told her yet that swans can be gay.

This happened a year ago. I used to work on a IT course as ""The IT Guy"", had a pretty good time there just fixing computers and you know... doing the ""IT Guy"" job.
When it happened to me and some other people were at the kitchen drinking coffee and just chillin' a bit. I was going to stay the whole night working on a server migration and everyone else wes getting ready to leave, then comes the conversation about marriage and this guy (Let's call him Mark), was talking about his wife. We decided to ask his age because he looked like he was 16 years old, well, he was 17... No problem at all, so the conversation goes on and he ends on the phrase ""I married her because she was pregnant"", oh, that makes some sense, then Mark says ""but the baby died in birth and we decided to give him to the university for research"", after this phrase my mind full of dark humor replies ""well, at least he reached college, medicine right ?"". Everyone turns at me, I can see some people holding laught and others looking in disgust, I just realised what i've said, finish my coffee and rush to the IT Room.
Mark never looked into my face again.

TL;DR - Told a guy that his dead baby could get a degree in medicine research.

3t3tx7,non_TBI,"This is a dual fuck up as it is equally my husband and I's fault. We have a 110lb mastiff pitbull mix that chews, destroys and eats all toys we've ever brought home within a matter of hours. After many months of going through one or two $10+ toys a week, we were feeling pretty discouraged. A friend recommended that we try ordering from a site online that brags about having indestructible dog toys. So we order a bone shaped toy for him made out of some hard nylon material.


The toy has been here for over three weeks now and it still looks like brand new. He loves it, we love it, it's great. From the second we got it we started calling it a ""boner"" instead of a bone because that's funnier. ""Go play with your boner, pup!"" ""I'm gonna get your boner!"" ""That's a nice boner you got there!"" type of thing. 


Well, today my three year old daughter went to a little arts and crafts party at a local crafts store and she was telling everyone how Daddy plays with the dog's boner and how much fun it is to watch Daddy play boners. I was mortified the entire hour long class and had some explaining to do. My husband and I have decided to make an effort to call it something else.

3vtzvt,non_TBI,"So this happened last night... I live in a dorm in college where the bathrooms are shared by both genders in groups of 10. There are 2 showers and 3 toilets, so multiple people (either gender), can be in the bathroom at the same time. After my shower, I was shaving my face in the mirror with my towel wrapped around my waist. While looking in the mirror everyday, I've notice myself getting a little chunkier and chunkier in the tummy area as the semesters gone on. 

Then as I'm standing there shaving, one of the cuter girls I share the bathroom with enters. Before we even make eye contact or say hello to each other, I somehow instinctively sucked my tummy in to look a little skinnier and then it happened. My towel (it must have been folded loosely enough) just unravels from the front and the towel just falls to the ground. Sadly, I wasn't fast enough to snag it before it got to my genitalia... There I am just standing there with my 3-inch post-shower pinch and hairy ass.

She was nice enough to act like she didn't see it though and she casually got in the shower like nothing happened. But she saw it. I know she saw it all.

We have these 3 REALLY COOL nerf swords, that we play with every day. He has actually gotten pretty good at dodging and parrying my attacks and when he starts rushing me i have to try my hardest to not get hit.

To spice things up we always do ""power struggles""... Pushing our swords together and then wrestling to make it more fun.

Well today we did that... but his sword gave out and cracked in the middle...

This led to my full force punch cracking him across the jaw and watching him go limp. 

I have never panicked so hard in my life. I felt sick instantly.. a full grown ""man"" punching a child can lead to some terrible things such as concussion.. or worse, death.

Luckily, he was only down and out for about 4 seconds. Went to the hospital and he has no concussion or anything, just a very sore little face.

Ice cream should cure the wound, but nothing will mend the cracks put into the heart of a little boy getting FUCKING KO'D LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

I appreciate it everyone. Have a good night

28j0pb,non_TBI,"Its technically Thursday now where I live, but it did happen a couple of hours ago. Anyways, I recently discovered the subreddit /r/nofap . I read many of their success stories on not fapping and becoming more confident around women. I guess this happens because testosterone and hormones build up and primal instincts kick in more. So I thought id give it a shot, since I never know what to say to the pretty girl that keeps sitting next to me in one of my classes. After about a week of holding it in, I do realize a change, as my 19 year old hormone-enraged body is ready to fuck the nearest living thing. Finally after much contemplating, I get the balls to ask this girl out after class. To my surprise, she said yes, she even told me she had been waiting this whole time. After my little dance of victory, I realized that the mission was accomplished. So my horny self begins to think that since I already scored the date, I had no reason not to masturbate. But the problem was I was still inside the college. But i guess today I was so horny that I disregarded the fact of what a stupid idea masturbating in public is. I rushed to the bathroom, into a stall, and whipped my meat out and just went TO TOWN. I was so into it that even when i heard the bathroom door open i didnt stop, I just tried to keep it quiet. 

This is the fucked up part. Since I always masturbate in my room with a tissue, I am kinda used to always unloading into the tissue. So without even realising that there is a toilet right in front of me, i quickly yank some toilet paper as I feel the end. I end up having one of the most intense orgasms ever, and im pretty sure I left a HUGE load in that tissue after a week of no fapping. Thats when I heard a voice next to me just kind whisper, ""hey do you have an extra toilet paper roll on your side? If you could pass me some you'd be a real bro""
Suddenly i just see a hand peek out under the stall. Since I was so caught off guard, without even thinking about it, I PUT THE WAD OF PAPER I JUST USED IN HIS HAND. He quickly grabbed it and I started panicking since i realized what I had just done. Then, there was just silence, and i just heard a faint, ""uhh what the fuck?""

So I got the fuck out of there as I bolted out before he could see me. but, hey, at least i got a date Friday. 

TL;DR Handed some dude my cum

Edit: fell asleep after posting this, so I didn't get to answer your comments immediately. But I'll try to answer as many. I'm never going back into that bathroom.


Edit 2: some of you said the no fap thing is placebo, and I agree, but at least it worked. Also, a few you asked me to update on the date and to try to share this story. I will add an update tomorrow on how that pans out

OP is a fag edit: Im so sorry guys. I totally forgot about updating this until /u/destroyer5656 PM'd me. The date went okay. I did not tell her the story, I couldnt find the right way to present it. i didnt make it to a second date, but it gave me a huge confidence boost!"
3pn7ov,non_TBI,"This just happened, unfortunately for me. 

So I'm running across town to pick up my hastily abandoned car from its overnight in-car-ceration near the pub. Beautiful morning, it's 7am, I'm ahead of schedule so things are going ok. 

Once in my car I remember some coffee left from the previous evening. Oh good! Cold coffee! It's 7-eleven coffee, and I'm pretty sure their milk products could survive the apocalypse unspoiled, so I'm not worried and willing to take a few sips. Ugh, dregs. But I need the caffeine. At this point I notice a little bit of extra... texture in there though. Did some crumbs from my granola bar get in last night? I swirl the nearly empty cup and drain it.

Weird... kind of crunchy. I'm still not worried about spoiled milk at this point. The crunchiness is too crumb-feeling, too *healthy* sounding to be a curdle. I swallow a few more crunchy bits before thinking to spit one out and look at it. If this sounds naive, please undrestand I was (and am) very tired, and I was *really convinced* they were just crumbs.

They weren't crumbs. They were bugs. Somehow my car has fruit flies, and they were breeding in my coffee. Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew.

Tl;Dr drank a bug orgy by accident."
3ffa2t,non_TBI,"This is a repost. I posted it in the thread about tinder dates and I was a bit late. It has stopped gaining points but I am getting a dozen messages a day from people encouraging me to post it here. I hope that's okay :-) 

*disclaimer; this did not happen today.


--------------------------------------------------

okay... this is gonna be strange.


I use a wheel-chair, as a result of a car accident. I'm paralyzed from the waist down. I can't really ""feel"" anything below my nipples. I can move my hands/arms just fine.



I went on Tinder and made sure my pictures showed the wheel-chair. I've had bad experiences with online dating and rude/mean remarks regarding my wheelchair, during a date. So I always make sure they know upfront.


Well. One day. I get a message and this chic is really into my profile, the movies and shows I listed, the music I listed, and digs my pictures. She says she's a nurse and doesn't judge people by their ""abilities""

...CHA-CHING



I pretty much do everything in my power to keep talking to this woman. Let's call her Jizzanthapuss. I talk to her everyday for a week. We say good morning and good night and talk throughout the day. It gets down-right obsessive, on both of our parts. On my part, mainly because I wanted some booty and it had been a while. I was willing to work for it.

**yada yada yada**

I meet Jizzanthapuss for our first date and it goes well. Very well. I think I might have found ""the one"" -- I tell my mother during our weekly long distance phone calls.

**yada yada yada**

a month has gone by, we've went on a couple of dates, and we talk every day -- practically every minute. I might be in love with Jizzanthapuss.

**Yada yada yada**
She asks why not come over to watch a movie?
I agree, and when I get there, I quickly discover her room-mate has left for the weekend. Yes, thank you sweet sexy baby jesus. I am alone with her. In her apartment. Watching a movie.

I stay in my wheelchair and just get close to the couch and put my arm around her shoulder, slightly squeezing every now and then.

I notice she is getting fidgety, looking around, and sneaking glances at me. I realize she wants me to make a move.

So I tell her to move over and I hop off my chair and onto the couch.


**TIME ELAPSES**

The appropriate time has elapsed, she is still close to me and reacting favorably to the advances. It is now time for me to grab a boob. I slide my hand which was on her shoulder -- down a bit, and grab a titty. I smile.


Now. Let me tell you. I'm in my mid-20's, I've had plenty of sexual experience before. but never like this.

She quickly flicked my arm away from her boob, in a violent manner, which almost worried me because I thought she was offended...

but before I could finish the thought, she aggressively grabs me and begins to make-out. All aggressive-like, did I mention that? It's pretty hot, I kind of like her taking control. Yes! Jizzanthapuss, you're in charge now!


Now, at this point, she says my wheel-chair is in the way and wheels it to the opposite side of the room, then comes back and sits on my lap-facing me, slips off her bra with one quick professionally graceful flick. Her bewbs flop out and I forget how to math and read.


She then slips off my pants, and begins to ride me as she pinches my nipples. Technically I'm not suppose to feel my nipples, but boy did my nipples hurt from all the tugging.


**Here's where things take a turn for strange-land**

 Now, let me explain. I can't feel anything below my nipples, but, my body does give me signs. For example, if I were to sit on sharp toothpick facing upwards, or if a rock got into my shoe -- I wouldn't be able to tell what/where exactly it is that there is pain. But my body gives me a sign (for example; a unique type of tingling) which I've come to understand and associate as the new feeling my body has improvised to inform me of pain. I've come to understand the new feelings I get; for pain, for going to the bathroom, for being uncomfortable, for needing to get off my butt from too much sitting. Etc etc. And when I get these feelings, I need to do something about it ASAP.



So, back to the apartment where I have b00bz flopping in my face, this tall chic riding me, and I'm practically in heaven. She asks me to bite her, and I do. Harder, she demands, and I comply.


Then, I notice a surge of numbness and tingling. It then turns into the kind of feeling which I've come to associate with pain. Very bad pain.


But fuck this, I'm getting some ass. And titties are all up in my face as I bite and suck her nipples.

Let me die here! I'll ignore the pain. Fuck it! fuck it! Fuck me Jizzanthapuss!


then, I can't ignore it anymore. It soon turns into the kind of sensation where I know I need to do something ASAP. Its too painful.

Furthermore, another tell-tale sign, I begin to sweat profusely on my left side. It's like a water-fountain, it begins dripping.


All the mean-while, Jizzanthapuss is really into it, moaning and being louder than anyone I've ever been with.


Eventually, I simply can't take it anymore, the discomfort is too much. And try to push her away gently (both hands on shoulders, slight push backwards) so as to see if maybe her weight on my lap is what's causing the pain.


But she resists my push, she's like a solid rock. I can't get her to budge.


She grabs a hold of my hair and yanks it back while riding me and tugging on my nipples.

Now.. I have a lot of neuropathic pain. I don't like pain. I live with it 24/7. I understand some people have ""different"" sexual appetites and desires and kinks. However, you need to communicate. You can't just start introducing pain and hope it'll be cool.


I giggle nervously and tell her to ""take it easy, a bit""
She then slaps me so hard, and out of nowhere. I did not expect it, at all, not even a little bit. You know that feeling? when you're blind-sided and someone just knocks you in the head? 


Her open-handed slap reached my forehead and everything went white for a second.

Now I'm more pissed than confused.

The pain is still there.

I scream at her. ""What the fuck!?"" and shove her off me and she plops down next to me on the couch.


Now that she's off me, I can see my left thigh is completely covered in blood. My first thought was she might have perioded'ed all over me. But why would I be in pain, then?


I look over at her and she's holding a black push-pin which is covered in blood.


I quickly put two and two together and conclude that those surges of pain had been from when she was stabbing my thigh with the pin.


She then gets up and sits on my wheelchair (which is at the other side of the room now)

I watch her for another minute (or 20?) and say ""what the fuck was that? I mean, I'm into kinky shit, but what the fucken fuck? and why would you stab me with a fucking pin? you're fucking sick, why wouldn't you communicate with me about that first?""


she casually says ""I dunna"" and starts playing with her legs, as she sits nude, on my wheelchair. Stretching them, pointing her toes at me, like a baby who just discovered her legs. Was she mocking me?

Finally, having had enough, and having soaked in the situation and concluded it wasn't a dream...

I tell her I'd like to leave. And to please bring my wheel-chair. I'm in pain and would like to tend to my wound and go home.
She looks at me and says, dead serious ""beg me for it""
for what, I ask?


She asks me to beg for the wheel-chair.


At this point I begin to truly get scared. I've known this chic for a month, and here I am; alone, naked, scared, and bleeding in her apartment on her couch. As she sits 15 feet away from me, nude, on my wheel-chair, and mocking me. Why didn't I tell anyone about her? why didn't I tell anyone I was here? am I gonna die?


I then shove my ego up my ass, and beg her to bring my wheelchair closer. Each round of begging, she brings the chair a bit closer. Until finally I was able to quickly lean forward and grab onto the leg part of the frame.

She hops off and goes into the bedroom, leaving the door open, and seductively looking back at me with an invitation sexy smirk.

I quickly ponder whether or not I should go to the bedroom and let her have her way with me. Sure this is wierd, strange, scary, and uncalled for; but she's got a vagina that I have an invitation to play with.


I decide, against my brain's many protests, that I should leave right away.

I pull up my pants, hop on my wheel-chair, and just wheel the fuck right out of there.


This incident... It kind of ruined sex for me. Because now I need to be dominated, verbally humiliated, and have my nipples clamped -- before I can even think about maybe cumming.

**TL;DR** Met a girl on Tinder, Chatted her up, went on a few dates, all is splendid. Then I go to her house to watch a movie and have some sexy time. Sexy time ensues and I discover she's a freak who enjoys pain, domination, and blood. 


**Edit#1** 
I don't consider this to be a rape. The sex was consensual, and save for the first time I tried to move her away and her not budging -- the next time I shoved her off she did move and the sex did stop. The first time I didn't shove her off it was more of a ""can u plz move"" request/push which she kindly shot down.


I'd classify it more as an assault.



**Edit#2**
Due to popular request from this thread. I decided to go report this at the police station. I brought a camera with me and recorded how it went.

>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYt0WbDjJ4E


**Edit#3**
srsly, though. I've decided to make an report to the ONA (ontario nurses association) just to warn them about her character and to recommend they look into whether she is abusing patients as she may be preying upon the disabled.


**Edit#4**
thanks to everyone for the kind words about my writing style. I really  consider myself a writer but have had writer's block for the longest time. It's lame but getting the compliments has reinforced my belief that I ought to continue my writing no matter what. Perhaps I'll turn this into a misery-esque ""based on a true story"" short novel.

**fixed spelling"
35pj0i,non_TBI,"This happened about a month ago and only now posting because I was telling the story to a co-worker. 

So while living in Virginia, I was in an apartment. Had neighbors move in and out, no big deal. The new couple that moved into next to me had this yappy, little fuck stick of a dog. The kind that barks non-stop with the shrill shriek like it's being attacked by a condor. 

A couple weeks go by and it won't get into a routine and shut the fuck up during the day. And at the time, I was on a rotating shift work schedule, so I struggled to sleep during the day.

I don't like complaining about neighbors to management so I figured I'd start on my level and just left a note on the door telling him that his dog barks, and I even put specific days and times, and I understand dogs don't speak English where they would understand a request to STFU but if they could attempt to quiet the dog or put a blanket over its crate to muffle the sound, I'd really appreciate it. And unlike some pussies, I put my name and apartment number on it. 

The next day, there's a knock at my door and it's the guy living next to me and he, very calmly, asks if he could talk about this. I invite him in and offer him a drink, he declines and we sit on my couch. He has my note in his hand, and gets right to the point, ""are you sure about these times the dog was barking?"". I was caught off guard, why the fuck does that matter when the dog barking is the problem? I tel him yes because that's when I was home during the day and noticed his cock sucking yelp. 

At this point, he looks distraught. I ask him what the problem is. He says that his dog never yaps when his wife is home. Okay? 

""Well I asked my wife about it and she dismissed your note right away and became very defensive about it. I asked her what the problem was and she just admitted to leaving for a little bit. But then when i mentioned it was for hours on end, she broke down and told me she was having an affair while I was gone to work""


Fucking awkward. I offer him a beer and we sat there talking about shitty relationships and drinking. We're actually friends and he's divorcing his wife.

TL;DR - complained to my neighbor about his dog, turns out his wife is a cheating skank. 

___________________________________________________

Edit: thank you kind stranger ( who prefers to stay anonymous) for the gold! I haven't decided whether to cast it one ring, you know, to rule all of the shrieking dogs or maybe just buy more guns. Or maybe I'll that guy out for another beer. 

Edit 2: To everyone that asked why he came over when his wife confessed, I have no fucking clue! If you've ever been cheated on, it's a tough pill to swallow. Maybe he was shell shocked, or looking for some sliver of hope that I was wrong about my times. In the end, it doesn't matter that he asked the question and was probably just looking for sympathy and/or someone to talk to. 

Additionally, to everyone that complained this wasn't  a real TIFU because either it literally didn't happen today (are you fucking serious?) or because I helped him out in the long run - yes, the end result was positive but don't forget that a marriage did end, and that's a fucked up and painful experience. He could've gone on in blissful ignorance. "
464yus,non_TBI,"So this literally happened like thirty minutes ago. Im walking to my buddies on campus and as I am walking this car proceeds to honk at me. Per usual I flip them the bird and keep walking. Not even thirty seconds later my mother calls me and says ""WHAT THE HELL NICK, YOU JUST FLIPPED PFF YOUR GRANDMA!!"" As it turns out my grandparents were in town visiting and they recognized me and honked to get my attention and a heatfelt wave. Little did they know when someone honks at you in Cincinnati it usually is not for those intentions."
3snwfb,non_TBI,"I know this is not how these things normally work, but this literally happened 5 minutes ago.

I just woke up from a crazy dream (probably caused by my new anxiety medication). 

In my dream, I'm at a party trying to get some homework done like the usual college student. 

When my girlfriend nonchalantly tells me this guy from my Psychology class is trying to sexual assault her.

As you can imagine I am pissed. I find the asshat and he runs away. I decide to shower in the rain, then I confront him again. This time he tells me some details about the assault.

At this point I am done, dream me is jacked like Arnold and is going to tear this guy up. I throw my first punch, but barely grazed him (I miscalculated the dream physics). 

He goes to throw his punch. But before he even interprets what's happening I perfectly execute the most meanest elbow directly to his face I've ever seen.

I woke up to my girlfriend cussing me out like no tomorrow, and refusing to acknowledge that elbow was meant for her attacker. 

Now I am typing this out as she is sleeping in the other room. "
3p14g2,non_TBI,"Obligatory 'didn't happen today' but when I was 9. This post was inspired by the recent Askreddit thread about your first experience with the internet. 

Anyway, do you remember when there were those make-your-own-website things way back? Sort of like MySpace but less focussed on the social aspect of it and more of a blog type of thing. Well, this happened around 2005 and a friend of mine was all hyped out about his own webpage. He would put pictures of cool cars and football players on there. As a result of this, I was stoked about making my own page to put weird Spongebob pictures and Lego sets that I liked on there.

Well, in 2006 Google's safesearch wasn't that advanced yet and I stumbled upon pornographic images during searches on the 4th page of images. Being young and innocent, I thought these images were exciting and in its own way funny. 

In my naivety I added some of these images on my website. I didn't know much about sex yet and it was a topic that I had not yet been educated about. I continued to add more and more search results of 'naked' 'vagina' 'tits' on the webpage. 

Now here comes the cringey part. My father had seen the website when it was still mostly a collection of cars and cartoons and thought it would be cute to show his coworkers my creation.

However, by the time he actually showed them, the website I had created had literally become a collection of porn. It must have been embarrassing as fuck expecting an innocent list of cool cars but instead showing a full on porn site your son created. 

That's when I got the talk about sex and internet safety and all that.



TL;DR: unknowingly created porn site, dad shows it to his coworkers"
3udco8,non_TBI,"So my girl and I have been together for 4.5 years. We've been doing this thing right from the start where, when we go to the gym together, she does her own routine (mostly cardio) and I do my own routine (mostly lifting). Sometimes, while she's lifting dumbbells in front of the mirror, I'll walk up and start hitting on her in a loud, obnoxious, neanderthalish way. I'm not really big, so it's pretty funny to see me acting like a big tough guido and picking up on her by acting like a dumbass.


Typically it embarrasses her but sometimes she plays along. It's the best when other dudes are watching (they're always checking her out or trying to make small talk with her anyway). So I'll walk up and be like ""AAAAYE SUP GIRL, YOU LOOKIN FIIIIIIINE, YOU GOT A BOFRAN?"" and she will act all charmed and start chatting me up.


Yesterday we went to the gym in the morning, and this fratboy starts talking her up. He is pretty jacked, and confident. She plays along, just chatting. After about ten minutes, I walk up and do my routine. I basically jump in on their conversation and I'm like, ""Oh yea whassup girl? I seen you here yesterday too. I seen you here a lot."" 


My fiancee smiles and is like ""Oh yeah? I've never seen you here. What's your name?"" and we start chitchatting and laughing while this meathead mouthbreather just watches with disbelief. Then after like 45 seconds I'm like, ""You wanna go grab some lunch? I'm always hungry after the gym because I lift so fuckin hard"" (and flash my 25 pound weights). She's like ""oh that sounds good! If you want to come over to my place I can cook for you!""


So we start to walk off, and the fratboy is like, ""Uh, dude, what the fuck is your problem?"" and I turn around, flash a douchey smile, and I'm like ""Oh sup bro?"" still in character. He's like, ""The fuck you swoopin' me for dog? You interrupted me. That's fucked up.""


I can tell this guy is about as smart as a six year old so I drop the routine and I'm like, ""Hey dude, relax, this is actually my fiancee."" But he doesn't back off. He's like ""I don't care, you NEVER swoop on another dude, NEVER. That's some fucked up shit, yo.""


At this point I'm just standing there with my mouth open, not even sure what this guy's problem is, and surprised he doesn't get that we were joking. He turns to my fiancee and he's like ""This guy's a douche, you should drop him,"" to which she gets mouthy (her father is some Navy oldboy so she swears like a fucking sailor) and says ""Get the fuck over yourself, you aren't going to pick up chicks in a gym."" 


Then he shouts ""FUCK YOU BITCH!"" right at her, and throws up a middle finger. Everybody in the gym stops what they're doing and turns to look at the situation. My fiancee, never one to back down from a challenge, goes to flip the guy off and call him a name, but I grab her and hustle her out of the gym. Neither of us were done working out, but uh, I think we're probably gonna take a week off before going back.


Edit: **TL, DR:** Some dude thought my fiancee was single. I walked up and introduced myself to her, stealing her from him. He got super mad and flipped out. 


**edit 2:** for the people who are telling me I'm a jerk, I agree with you, I think that actually most of the blame is on my shoulders, not the fratboy's. I humiliated a dude who wasn't really doing anything wrong. Just being a little douchey, that's all. His reaction was unnecessary, but so was my trick on him. That is one of the many reasons this is a TIFU.


For the people who are calling me a coward for not *assaulting a person in a gym with security cameras*, uhh, okay, thanks for the advice. What would the judge have said? Some guy said something mean so you tried to kill him with a dumbbell? There's no way I'd come out on top after that. I did the right thing - I didn't escalate the situation further.

------------


**edit 3:** People are flipping out about this post, it's ridiculous. Let me address some of the PM's that are shredding my inbox:


1. She was not wearing an engagement ring. At the gym. I have never seen someone wearing an expensive ring at the gym. Perhaps I'm being too incredulous, but who would do this? Are there married women reading this? Do you wear your ring at the gym? Should we? Is this supposed to be a thing?


2. There are people giving me relationship advice that indicates to me they have never interacted with a woman ever. You don't own your fiancee. You cannot control who she speaks to. And for those with zero self esteem, a woman will not run off with someone else because they hit on her and you didn't murder him. And if your girl leaves you because you refused to get in a fist fight over *stupid shit*, then trust me, you are *way better off without her*.


3. If a guy hits on your girl, don't take it as an insult. Take it as a compliment. Jealousy is not attractive, and it will result in her cheating or leaving. I guarantee it. I advise you not to get into a fist fight with someone if they insult your girl. If they threaten her, of course, they deserve to get Batman'd.


------------


**Final edit:** About 10 folks have commented/PM'd me calling me a ""beta"" for not decking this guy. Trust me when I say that if you think in terms of ""alpha"" and ""beta"", I can guarantee you three things:


A. [Nobody needs relationship advice from you. Ever.](https://xkcd.com/1027/)


B. You are single. And not by choice. 1000% guarantee.


C. *You* are a ""beta."" Because only someone with no self esteem at all would have to categorize men like this and then assert that they themselves are an alpha."

298g16,non_TBI,"After she had hinted for about a week that it would be a turn on if I urinated on her. She said she hadn't done it before, it would be a first for both of us. A couple of nights ago, I finally did it in the shower on her leg, but she quickly dropped to catch it on her face. Surprised, my stream stuttered, but once you start, it's hard to stop so I resumed urinating on her awkwardly. Lo and behold she had to bang right then and there so we did and it was awesome. 

Later, when we were having dinner, she casually mentions that it's weird how my pee tasted a bit sweet so I jokingly ask her how she knows what it's meant to taste like. She didn't answer so I left it. 

While cleaning up, she breaks down and tells me that she'd had several exes do it before. This was the last lie in a series that ended the relationship. So far not too bad right?

At lunch today, I was regaling a buddy with the story of how I ended things with the urine-faced pisswhore, and ended it with ""Hey, at least she thought my piss was sweet haha."" 

Buddy is a med student and immediately took me to a clinic.. 

TIL I have diabetes.

She deceived me into doing something I was/am/DEFINITELY WILL BE FROM NOW ON super uncomfortable with, saying we could share a ""first time"" together. I wanted to make this work, since I forgave her for such massive things in the past and now I'm a dick for ending shit with her because she asked her ex pissed in her mouth while we we were together?

Edit for responses: 
To the silver lining people (I like you people): I am actually glad that I know about it now, and at this stage, I guess it's better than going undiagnosed. Thanks for the encouragement and information. 

To the kink defenders (I get your reaction): I have to explicitly state here that it had very little to do with her hiding that she has a kink, but rather who with and when. More on this in the following response.

To the series-of-lies enquirers (Your curiosity is justified): If you believe that her hiding her kink was the only reason I broke up with her, then I agree it's petty. But no. When we first started, she hid from me that she was still sleeping with her ex. To this day I am unsure if they broke up before or after we began, but I am sure that after we ""went official"" she slept with her ex again when I was overseas and she.. got kinky then. Fun fact 1: I found out from his friend that they banged, who was surprised she and I ""got back together"". Fun fact 2: She asked her ex to piss on her face when I was overseas for work. 

To the judgmental insulters (Suck my sweet dick): See parentheses.

So that day, while in the stairs, I let my thoughts wander and come to the conclusion that I can't wait to finish work so I can take a shit. Because, you know, there is no place like home for that kind of things.

Anyway, my brain being in auto pilot mode from the routine, I open the secretaries' door, squeeze my head and say ""I'm going to take a shit"". It is just when I close the door and hear everyone laugh inside that I realize what I've done...

Happened 3 or 4 months ago, and they still have that little smile when I say I'm going to smoke.


Edit : Wow, thanks everyone, glad you enjoyed it !
So yeah, no harm done here, everyone had a good laugh, myself included. I just thought that the HUGE embarrassment was worth a TIFU and a share :)"
4045eb,non_TBI,"So the obligatory this didn't actually happen today, but Tuesday.

Our kids finally went back to school after the break, and we had the house to ourselves. Husband was doing paperwork online before going in to work. He came out into the living room to talk with me.
I decided I'd try and be playful and take advantage of the empty house. I crawled seductively across the room to try and get him to play. Well, what I forgot is, that it's winter and there's absolutely no humidity. So static everywhere. Once I got to him, I was kneeling and he bent down to kiss me. I thought ""Hell yeah! I am a goddess and this is going to be awesome!"" I mean, we haven't had sex out of our room, let alone during daylight hours for over 3 weeks because of the kids always being around.

As he bent down, his nose brushed mine. All of that charge I built up crawling across the room then jumped from me to him and went up through his eye! He said he actually saw the flash! The pain abruptly ended any desire right then and there. And not only that, it caused his eye to twitch for the rest of the morning.

TLDR: I tried to seduce husband by crawling across the floor, but instead shocked him so bad that he was left with a twitching eye and no desire for sex."
2fwoor,non_TBI,"I'm a cashier at a grocery store. One of my friends is a regular and we joke around a lot, usually it starts by me refusing to ring up her groceries and we have a few laughs from there. 

Yesterday was a fairly busy day. I see her get in my line behind the customer I was ringing up. I finish the transaction, so my friend is next. I'm still putting money in my drawer, so without looking up I loudly say ""Ma'am, we don't serve your kind here."" Usually at this point my friend laughs and makes a remark right back at me, but this time there was only silence. I look up and see not my friend, but a black woman with a shocked look on her face. My heart drops into my feet and I start to apologize but she puts her basket on the floor and walks away.

The front end manager was running the next register over and saw the whole thing. I was fired on the spot. I tried to explain the situation but she just said ""Punch out and leave right now.""

I later found out that my friend had forgotten something and had to get out of my line. The black woman took her place. If I had looked up I would have seen.

Unemployment hearing is next Thursday.

EDIT: Gold on a throwaway account??? "
2tp2iq,non_TBI,"Several years ago, my wife and I were visiting a friend and her girlfriend for the weekend. On Saturday night they threw a party with all of their friends, most of whom were also lesbian couples. I saw that one girl had Chinese characters tattooed on her forearms, so I asked to see them, as I had recently been living in China. She was like, ""Oh, they're actually *Japanese* characters. This one (万) means 'man,' and this one (女) means 'woman.' Basically, I'm trying to describe how all of us exist on a gender continuum between the two and integrate parts of both into our identities to different degrees.""

I responded, ""Actually, Japanese characters (kanji) and Chinese characters (hanzi) are really the same thing. And I don't think that one (万) means 'man.' It actually means 'ten thousand.' The correct character for man is 男. 万 and 男 aren't that far off, but the calligraphic style on it would make it hard to replace...""

I look up and this poor girl is literally in tears. The entire party had come to a standstill as I pompously embarrassed this kid in front of all her friends. She had had the tattoo done two or three years earlier and no one had ever caught it.

I had to add, ""On the bright side, Chinese doesn't really have a plural, so 万女 is a perfectly grammatical way of saying 'ten thousand women.' Make it a life goal!""

Crickets...

EDIT, courtesy of  /u/Snumpler: 

TL;DR: Lesbian didn't check her facts and I gave her a life goal."
44kr76,non_TBI,"Alright, so I lost a bunch of weight recently. I was a big guy at the time of my wedding, and as a result of the weight loss my wedding ring is now a whole lot looser around my finger.

So, perhaps thanks to my new sexy physique (...) the missus and I were getting it on today. With a devious glint in her eye, she suggested: ""How about anal?""

Excellent plan, of course. I got the lube and used copious amounts. Now, you've got to take it slowly; first, gently with one finger... Then two... And finally, my index, middle and ring finger were all lubed up and in there. Good times.

After my lady was sufficiently warmed up, we were happily banging away. But as I slapped her fine ass, I noticed something. Something missing. 

""Hey, my ring came off,"" I said. 

""Probably on the mattress,"" she replied.

Not on the mattress.

""On the ground?"" she asked, now with a hint of nervosity.

Not on the ground.

Then it dawned upon both of us.

&nbsp;

So my fingers went back in there. Yet my monster dong (...) had already pushed it far beyond reach. I spent a good 10 minutes with my hand up my wife's butthole. I even tried to lighten the mood by doing my best Gollum impression and hissing: ***""My preciousss! Give it back to us!""*** But she was not amused.

We finally had to give up the search. She drank 4 cups of coffee over the course of the next hour and made her retreat to the bathroom with a box of rubber gloves. From the living room I heard an explosive splattering sound, followed by a faint *""Oh my God...""*

After half an hour of scrubbing she handed me my ring back without making eye contact. 

&nbsp;

So now, whenever I look at my ring, I'm reminded of the vow I took to always be at the side of my lovely wife, on the day of our beautiful wedding ceremony. And how this particular piece of jewelry was violently blasted out of her asshole amongst a torrent of diarrhea.

3vfsfg,non_TBI,"Before I begin I just want you to understand I'm not from the states I'm from germany, and currently attend Ohio state university. This is also a throw away cause I don't want it linked with my main anyway in America the culture shock is insane, and I picked up a lot on the dialect anyway. I met a very beautiful girl here, and we hit it off. We are practically dating, but not official yet. Anyway we were getting to know each other, and I mean really know each other she asked me everything from sex life, dating life, goals, aspirations, dreams hopes etc and throughout these questions she asked me one question that I didn't understand was too embarrassed to answer but did anyway. She asked me ""Vanilla or Kinky"" I did not understand what this meant it made no sense vanilla is an ice cream flavor, but kinky made it obvious it was a sexual question.. I just picked vanilla cause vanilla seemed less dirty. I knew she was sexually attracted to me to ask that so I just went with it.. in my head I thought vanilla was pouring vanilla on her and licking it off. After our conversation I decided to pick up vanilla ice cream.. cause I thought she wanted me to lick it off her. The next time we had sex I planned on pouring it on her and licking it off cause I thought that is what she was hinting at. Either way we met up in her dorm room, and we were getting into it, and I took out the ice cream from my bag (it melted a little), and poured a big scoop of it on her body and she goes ""WHAT THE FUCK"", and I'm hesistant a bit and she says ""What are you even doing..."" she was a little more calm now, and I explained the whole thing.. turns out that vanilla means regular.. for some fucking reason vanilla meant regular. I felt like a retard beyond belief... she laughed for a good 5 minutes, and went to take a shower and I'm sitting there thinking my god what the fuck is wrong with me....she was very cool about it though.. and we were still ""together"", but I will never live it down. I later skyped my family back home in germany, and my mom was dying of laughter, and my dad sat there with the stupidest look on his face.. and now I'm here typing this.

AutoModerator is threatening me so here is ""TLDR""

TLDR: got asked vanilla or kinky, thought vanilla meant pouring vanilla on girl and licking it off. did as such, and humilated my self.

38jawh,non_TBI,"I was walking towards my bank to deposit a cheque into my account when I saw what I thought was two very small children about to cross a carriageway. 

I should point out, I have to wear contact lenses but they are not vital, but to me, everything past around 10m just looks like a photoshopped blur, I can tell what's there but I can't make out distinct features.

I walked faster to attempt to see whether they were just being stupid or whether they were actually going to cross. One of them took a step into the road to get a better look around a bus that was stationary at the side of the road. This is when I thought to myself something really bad could happen. I started sprinting at them. They turned and looked at me and as my vision started to clear I had a surprise. Looking back at me was a dwarf woman and what looked to be her grandson. 

I didn't know what to do so I just carried on sprinting and hopped on the bus. I looked at the driver and engaged him in conversation whilst the woman continued to eye me suspiciously. I whispered faintly, ""I'm just gonna confess I don't have any money, I just mistook that dwarf for a kid about to cross the road and it was just instinct""..
The bus driver started giggling to himself and said he'd drop me round the corner to spare everyone's embarrassment.

Apart from mine. Obviously. Good guy though. 

Edit: for all those criticising me about not wearing contacts, I know the limitations of my eyes very well thank you. This isn't an everyday occurrence, I wear them based on whether I'll actually need them. They cost money. I'm only slightly shortsighted, the fact I had to sprint to them should indicate I was at a distance that most people might have second guessed. 

Edit 2: thanks for the gold! Much appreciated! "
2pdunp,non_TBI,"So this happened about 2 months ago, I'm a cook at a small family owned restaurant but I can fill in for the bussers when they need which is what I was doing on that fatefull day. Im a pretty quiet guy so bussing and hosting is a bit out of my element so I was already uncomfortable enough as it was. Then this middle aged overeweight couple came in looking for a table to sit at. These people were probably 300 lbs each, keep in mind I would never judge them or make fun of them. I asked them, as I ask all parties that come in, how many people they had. 

This is where it starts to go south, they said two but in a loud restaurant and being far away I somehow heard 5. They asked to sit in the bar but I told these two overeweight people, thinking they needed a table for 5 that our biggest table in the bar was for 4 but ""they could probably fit."" The man looked at me funny and said ok... we will just sit here, pointing at a booth that also seats 4. I said ok, ""would you like me to get an extra chair to put on the end for more space?"" This time the man looked angry and said ""its ok, I can fit my fatass in here."" At this point I was starting to realize something was up so I tried to explain myself by saying that I just wanted them to have enough space. This didnt help my case. The man now looked furious and asked what my problem was. I then realized what could be the problem and asked how many people were with them, they told me 2 and I then apologized and explained my confusion. The man didnt think it was funny though and I avoided them all night. I did tell my manager what happened and she laughed her ass off.

tl; dr: thought a fat couple wanted a table of 5 when they only wanted a table for 2, repeatedly told them they couldnt fit at a table for 4.

3ufnqc,non_TBI,"I wish I'd discovered this subreddit earlier, because I have a sad amount of TIFU stories and this one is my favorite.

I had just finished taking my final exam and was walking up to my professor to hand her the paper. After I handed her my exam I started thanking her for teaching such a fun class (it was a class about sexuality and I loved it) and as I was talking to her I noticed her arm reaching forward - about to hug me. 

I had a rapid, panicky thought process. Oh my god, I've never hugged a professor before? Is this allowed? Is this breaching a student-teacher relationship? Does this mean we're friends?? But I liked this professor and didn't want to be cold to her, so I immediately raised my arms to hug her back. But I was so nervous, so I sort of lurched forward to hug her back.

My arms were almost around her and her arm was hovering above my shoulder when I saw her face suddenly look shocked, then she started to laugh. I looked over my shoulder behind me and I realized SHE HAD BEEN REACHING BEHIND ME TO GRAB ANOTHER STUDENT'S EXAM PAPER. 

I was mortified, but my professor thought it was hilarious and ended up actually hugging me before I left the classroom in shame. She ended up choosing me as her TA later on in the year!

EDIT: My professor did not choose me as her teaching assistant because I awkwardly hugged her! Sorry, I should've been clearer; that happened way way later and was intended to be a nice bonus to offset my mess-up story. And yes, she is attractive, but I would never never never ever flirt with her or anything like because I only see her as my professor. "
3fkhdt,non_TBI,"This happened in the last 24 hours. Will provide proof below. 

So I just moved to a new area, and I'm pretty active in the online dating scene. I have an account on several different websites, because why the fuck not. 

About five days ago, I start talking to this girl, who we'll call Heather. I'm 24 and she's 24. Perfectly normal type of thing. We've been texting for the last couple of days, things seem to be going well, and we were planning on getting lunch at some point in this upcoming week. 

I'm looking for a relationship, and Heather seems to be as well, so we're on the same page about our intentions. However, I will sometimes browse the older women (anywhere from mid 30s to upper 40s) on the website, and if I'm intrigued enough, I'll send them a message. 

Well, last night, I was browsing through older women and ended up finding a few that caught my eye, so I send them a message which basically reads ""Hey! This is random, but I thought you were cute. I know I'm out of your age range but do you have any interest in hanging out with a younger guy?""

One of these women, Jane, sends me a message back that reads ""I'm flattered, but you're as old as my daughter. Perhaps I should introduce you two.""

""Oh,"" I thought. ""That's nice, but a little strange.""

Still, I didn't think much of it. 

I hadn't heard from Heather since yesterday evening, so I sent her a text several hours ago asking how her day was going. 

[Here was her response](http://i.imgur.com/tHHtdxP.png?2)

I guess Heather and I aren't getting lunch afterall.

TLDR: I was hit by a ricochet bullet while trying to poach cougar. 

Edit: caught a few misspellings 

Edit 2: For those saying I'm a douche bag for talking to other women...I hadn't even met this girl yet and had only been texting her since like Thursday. You all need to relax.

Edit 3: A few more details. I talked to both on different websites. So it was super unexpected. I also live in a major city so the odds of this happening are extremely minuscule.

And no, I'm not posting a picture of the two. "
440ynj,non_TBI,"Yesterday, so it almost was today. 

Husband and I went to file our taxes. When it came time to choose the direct deposit option, we'd forgotten to bring our bank routing info with us. Luckily, our bank is right beside our tax office, so I just walked over to get a print off. 

I'd had our baby in a carrier up until this point. She was reaching for her Daddy and the tax lady was 'oohing' and 'ahhing' at her, so I took her out of the carrier and left her with them.

I didn't think to _take the carrier off_.

Some one seen me walking to the bank with it on and called the police. 

.00075 seconds later, we're surrounded by cops, guns drawn, etc, etc. Luckily, they seen it was a Baby'Bjorn and _not_ a bulletproof vest pretty quickly.

TL:DR, Apparently baby carriers look like bulletproof vests, so don't wear them to banks.

**EDIT**: seen, saw, looked at.... Feel free to read it whichever way makes you feel happy inside, I couldn't care less. "
3njnxv,non_TBI,"This actually happened years ago when i was in 1st grade, however I just remembered it while reading another post and decided to share it with whoever gives a fuck.

So in first grade some friends and I decided to dig a hole to china. We couldn't let any of the teachers know our evil plan, however, so we decided to hide the hole when we were not working on it. We first dug under the home plate on the baseball field, yet we soon found out the hole was too wide to hide under the plate everyday.

(We had been digging this hole for the better part of a week now so it was getting pretty big). 

So we made a basket-net out of sticks and leaves and put some of the dirt over it to hide the hole. It was actually a pretty good job too, because evidently about a week later when the baseball team came out to warm-up by running laps around the plates, someone fell into our pit of death and broke their leg, and as they fell down in pain also broke their arm. They also had several sticks we had used to cover the pit stuck in their leg.

Needless to say we didn't tell anyone that we dug the hole, and it is now our fault that Benson Hill Elementary school doesn't allow anyone to go onto the baseball field during recess.

TL;DR- Dug a hole to china, accidentally created a punji-pit, broke someones arm and leg while impaling them with sticks.

EDIT - Wow, thanks for the gold and funny comments you filthy Zargonians. So, some questions I read:

1. How did we dispose of the sand? Well we just threw it behind us or flattened out the pile when it was made. I don't really remember any of the teachers giving a fuck because we used to play boys vs girls, which is basically when a mob of boys with military ranks charge the girl groups that always played....idk what the girls played...but we would charge them and beat each other up in big fights for fun. I think they were just happy we decided to dig instead of murder each other.
2. How did we dig? Well to be honest, with sticks and our hands. What took us 4 days I can do now in 30 minutes with a shovel. So piss off sweethearts. 

EDIT - Anyone who thinks that a bunch of little kids dug a hole deep enough for someone to FALL INTO and break a leg and arm, needs to go bury themselves. The hole was like 3 feet deep, he fell in up to his thigh and the momentum of his run combined with the angle of the trapped leg caused the break. When he then fell he fell on his arm at a similar angle, and the downward pressure caused either the radius or the ulna to fracture as well, I'm not sure if it was compound or not all I know is that the fucker had a cast on. The sticks were stuck in his legs, and some cut his torso."
3rc3gt,non_TBI,"This wasn't today, this was about 18 years ago, but it haunts me every day.

When I was about 6 I had a friend from school who wasn't quite with it. I'd been lumbered with him as a result of my mum and his mum working together. His mum was really worried about him and felt that he was acting strangely because he had no friends. When I say acting strangely, he had recently collected all of his parents' clothes in the front room and set them on fire, then sat by the window waiting for superman to arrive. ""Strange behaviour"".

So he's at my house one day and we're playing some stupid superhero game when he comes out with, 'You know The Flash? I can actually run faster than him.' So I call bullshit and he says, 'No seriously, I haven't shown anyone because I don't want them to take me away and do experiments, but I'll show you if you promise to keep it secret.' So my 6 year old brain is now becoming slightly more convinced and he suggests as means of proof that we should get my hamster, bring it to the top of the stairs, throw it down and he would super-fast race down and catch it before it hit the ground. So off we pop, hamster in tow, he throws it down the stairs, before he even takes ONE step it smacks against the wall at the bottom. I stared at him for a few seconds in utter shock. I have a sobering moment of clarity thinking 'of course he couldn't do it, why the FUCK did I think he could?' I burst out crying, mum comes out, sees dead hamster, I never see that kid again. Don't even remember his name. Fucking idiot.

"
3xtp2w,non_TBI,"This is a fuckup that spans nearly two years.

A while back, I had a spine surgery; Idiopathic Adolescent Scoliosis. It meant my back literally started twisting. Painful shit, and the worst case the surgeon had ever seen.

Anyway, post-surgery, my parents agreed that for actually going through with it (*The surgery did have a small chance to completely paralyze me from the waist down, which probably would have spiralled into me having to go to Comicon as Gage from PAYDAY 2*), they would buy me a gaming PC. Not some ludicrous NASA-grade supercomputer, no, but certainly a rig-and-a-half.

So, for the past two years, I've been playing with it, talking to friends on it, and doing relatively well-rendered screenshots in Garry's Mod. However, despite its caliber as a 'gaming' PC, I was slightly underwhelmed by how it performed. It was...average.

It was only today that I realized something I'd done wrong.

In a moment of irritation whilst the display kept freezing up and frames were terrible, I looked online to see if there was a means of fixing it. And there it was; A diagram of the back of a PC. Sweet, let's do this.

You had the integrated processor with its' own built-in graphics, right...

...and the two Nvidia GTX-770s at the bottom of the PC.

I then checked my PC.

I'd had my display connected to the wrong place.

***For two years.***

I took this as nothing major, and changed where it was plugged in.

Then, I loaded up PAYDAY 2 and was ***literally brought to orgasm*** when I saw the incredible 70FPS I was getting on foliage-heavy environments.

**TL;DR**: My PC hid its power level from me for two years because I'm shite at plugging things in.

**EDIT**: Right, let's clarify a few things.

No, I am not an advertising agent of any kind. I'm a teenage lad with a job stacking shelves in a supermarket.

No, I am not retarded. To those who have said I'm mentally retarded because the surgery *on my SPINE* failed, I think you might need to rethink that statement.

I don't know why it wouldn't operate the graphics cards over the integrated graphics. It was registering they were on the system, and for the whole time I hadn't connected them properly, I was installing driver updates with no problems. It only properly began using them when I plugged my monitor into the graphics cards.

To me, 70FPS on PAYDAY 2 is fucking amazing, probably because I'm used to it going at about 20-30FPS.

Garry's Mod was an alright benchmark for graphics, since it was able to render more advanced lighting with few problems.

Any other games I played in the time I hadn't connected my graphics card normally got put on the lowest settings and reached relatively high framerates.

The surgery went fine. I am now worth £10,000 more because of the metal, and I work long shifts and do construction work from time to time."
3g7wsp,non_TBI,"So I'm a short white girl and I work at a Chinese restaurant.


Part of my job is putting food in boxes for you at the end of your meal. I don't know why I'm not supposed to let you do it, but I'm not. In any case, a few nights ago I was boxing up some food for a table of huge black dudes. As I was putting their chow mein in one box I was thinking ahead to where the rice would go. Some people are particular about separating food (though I prefer to conserve boxes and just put all that shit in one cuz who are you kidding all Chinese food tastes the same after a night in the fridge) so I decide to ask these guys what their preference would be. 


What I meant to say was ""Would you prefer to **separate** the brown and the white rice?"" 
Instead what I said was ""Would you prefer to **segregate** the brown and the white rice?""

They bust out laughing and I was really embarrased, and if you were wondering, they were cool with putting all the rice in one box. 

TL;DR: was racist, but it was cool
"
3iiabe,non_TBI,"This actually happened last night.

For those of you unfamiliar with the game [""Seaman""](http://caution-seaman.wikia.com/wiki/Caution_Seaman_Wiki), it's a trippy virtual-pet game for the Sega Dreamcast, in which you raise small talking fishes into two wise-ass Frogmen. The little dude asks you questions about your personal life and you respond to him via an attached microphone. He remembers the details and mentions them in future conversations. You have to play it once a day or he dies and you have to start from the beginning.

Anyway, I had just met this really cool but shy redheaded girl last weekend and we hit it off.  She shares my love of video games, and is actually really good at them. She's also gorgeous, which is a plus. I asked if she wanted to come to the house and meet my roommates and hang out. She showed up and we smoked a little weed. Being baked, I decided it would be a good idea to play some video games. 

I just remembered that I haven't fed the Seamen yet, so I asked her if she wanted to see one of the weirdest games ever made. She said yes, so I powered it on and fed the two Frogmen. What happened next left me aghast.

I told her, ""Watch this,"" and then turned on the mic and said, ""Hey, what's up Seaman?""

The Frogman replied, *""Hello, it's good to see you home tonight instead of out on a weekday. A few days ago, I asked you if you had someone special in your life, and you told me you didn't. So tell me, do you now have a special lady-friend in your life?""*

This question came outta nowhere and caught me off guard. The girl's face was beet red.

""Uh, Yeah?,"" I responded.

*""So you DO have a lady friend. So let me ask you, is she the ONE?""*

""I-I don't know,"" I replied. ""I just met her."" I don't think the answer registered with Frogman.

*""C'mon, just answer the question. Let me ask you again, is she the one?""*

""I don't know.""

Frogman, with a shitty look on his face, said, *""You know, you really shouldn't stay with someone just because it's convenient, because then you're wasting your time. Alright, I'm all talked out for today.""* He then hopped off.

She looked pretty creeped out by this point. I said, ""So yeah, I told you it was a weird game.""

**TLDR: Talking virtual frog totally killed the mood.**

***
UPDATE: Wow, didn't expect this kind of response! Also, thanks for popping my Reddit-Gold cherry, internet stranger! Since so many have asked, I'm still talking to the girl, who saw this post and thought it was pretty funny. She also wants to play the game now, so maybe I can show her my Seamen again.

Many have doubted the authenticity of this fuck-up, and have even doubted the existence of such an old game with such an advanced AI. The ""AI"" is not advanced, and just gives long-winded answers to simple commands. About 90% of the shit Seaman asks you are Yes/No questions. A user mentioned they had found the [question that I was asked by Frogman.](https://youtu.be/UPL081VjZOc?list=PLcUDAtodzSbEAaj1vZXEXD_si0qUHwCM2&t=202) He gives a different response in this scenario, since the player states he is still single. I decided to read a FAQ about this game to find the exact dialog and this question apparently leads into a conversation in which Seaman asks to be set free to find his ""true love,"" which means I can finally wash my hands of this slimy douchebag frog. 

Many have asked how to play this game. It's only on Dreamcast. I think the only emulator that supports the microphone is Reicast, which still can't run Seaman as far as I know.

3h6tl1,non_TBI,"Hello Redditors!

Well this story didn't happen today, not yesterday, but it happened about 8 years ago.

Just to give you a little background about me. My name is Dylan, I'm 22 years old and I live on the beautiful Island of Malta. I would also like to apologize on behalf of my Vocabulary, Punctuation, Spelling Mistakes & Structure Formation. This is my first time writing on Reddit. Hell this is my first time in a long time since I practiced writing, but enough about me and lets get into the story. 

I was 14 at the time and my parents were invited to attend a wedding. I had just started to earn the trust of my parents. It was a very rare occasion to be left alone at home. I mean, my parents had it coming right? So without any hesitation I decided to throw a house party.

Called up my best friend Brian and told him everything I had been planning. I continued to invite 4 other close friends of mine, - Bogart, Charlie, Tom & Eric.

We were all too much excited about this party. We had started preparing from weeks before. You see, we had never been to a house party, let alone host one. The day had arrived. Brian and I started doing preparations for the party. We went to a local bar and bought a pack of pint plastic glasses, Orange and Pineapple juice, 3 packs of cigarettes, some snacks and a 75 cl bottle of J&B and a 75 cl bottle of Smirnoff Vodka (At that time the drinking age was 16 years old. No one asks for I.D. here in Malta, no one gives a fuck really). Now, keep in mind that none of us had ever really drank alcohol before, apart from the occasional beer that we used to split between god knows how many people and a few sips of cheap cooking wine. 

Brian, Bogart and I are neighbors. We literally live a few seconds from each other. Charlie, Tom & Eric lived about 20 mins from my village, so they had their parents dropping them off at my house. We all agreed to tell our parents that we would be meeting at my house and that we were going to watch a movie at a cinema, which is about a 30 minute walk from my home.

The clock struck 8 p.m. and my parents were gone!

My friends started arriving one by one. I put on an MP3 CD I burnt into my Hi-Fi stereo, it was some 8-bit music, played by Henry Homesweet if I remember correctly. I remember it was bad-ass at that time because it resembled something out of my Gameboy's music. I started pouring about a quarter Vodka in each glass, mixing it with Orange or Pineapple juice. We toasted the drinks and I yelled ""The last one to down this glass is gay!"". Now, looking back, iv'e gotta say Bogart really took that to heart. He downed that pint of Vodka in mere seconds, with everyone following afterwards. Big surprise, I downed it last. I still get nauseous by that horrible taste of Vodka.

Straight away we started to get drunk. One glass would of made that night epic for all the right reasons, not for the wrong ones. We chatted a bit, laughed and pulled some pranks on each other, whilst sipping on another pint of Vodka Pineapple. We proceeded to take the party to my parent's room (I don't know why). Grabbed a pack of playing cards, started shuffling them and we started playing poker. Well, some card game that resembled poker at least. This is when shit stared hitting the fan. We had almost finished the Vodka bottle, only a couple of shots left, so to make things interesting, anyone who lost a hand had to take a shot of Vodka mixed with J&B Whiskey (Kids, Don't). Worst. Idea. Ever. We were all pretty drunk already. Bogart got a really unlucky streak. He lost hand after hand after hand. Oh my god I swear, iv'e never seen anyone drink as much as he did in the space of 10 minutes.

All pandemonium started breaking loose in my parents room. Charlie spilled a whole bottle of orange juice on to my parents bed sheets, Brian and Tom laughing their asses off, Eric was running through my parents drawers, I was too drunk to give a fuck and Bogart was hopping on my parents bed like a 6 year old. All of a sudden we hear a big strange bang. Bogart miss timed a jump and ended up landing on the back of his head on the wooden drawers. He was just out of it. Don't think he remembers anything from that point on.

We really didn't know what had just happened, we didn't see him hit the back of his head, we just saw him on the floor dazed. He started slurring his words. ""He's just really drunk"" we said and continued with the party.

My parents had a secret stash of porn in their room and I started showing them to everyone. Someone had the most brilliant idea of putting a porno in the DVD player for Bogart to watch so he can start to sober up. I gave him a roll of toilet paper, put in the DVD and left him alone.

It had started to get late. We already had been drinking for about 2 hours or so, so we stopped drinking since some parents were going to pick some of my friends up in an hour or so. We smoked a couple of cigarettes and I decided to go check on Bogart as he had been there for 15 mins or so. In fact, he was so quiet that we had totally forgot about him. As soon as I opened up the door I hear a loud smack. His head was standing in front of the door's path. The door vibrated with the ripple effect. He was unconscious. He couldn't talk, he couldn't walk. He was out of it. He was passed out like it was New Years Eve in 1919. A couple of seconds later, Charlie opens the door while Bogart was still laying on the floor. BANG, the door hit him square on his head again with a bigger impact then the one before.

At that point, seeing the state he was in, lying on the floor naked, drooling out of his mouth, jizz on his torso.. We sobered up just by looking at him. It stated hitting me. It was getting late and he was still unconscious. What are we going to do?

So we carefully picked him up, which proved to be quite the challenge, we put him in the tub and started washing him with cold water just to try to wake him up. Reality was starting to hit hard. We started panicking. He wasn't waking up, he just laid in tub motionless. Eric started smacking him in the face, whilst letting his head hit the tub every time he slapped him. When all of a sudden, he opened his eyes and stood upright in the tub. We were jubilant. We started clapping, patting each other on the back, we even started chanting his name. The look on his face wasn't quite just right though. About 10 seconds after... He threw up on his bushy penis. Closed his eyes and went unconscious again whilst hitting his head on the tub again as he leaned back.

About 5 minutes passed and Bogart's phone stated ringing. It was his Mum.

Some useful background on his Mum. We were all scared shitless of Bogart's mum. I really don't know her that well to say anything bad about her, i'm sure anything she did she had her reasons for it, but I had seen a younger Bogart get a couple of the loudest yells iv'e ever heard and quick beatings from her when he wasn't behaving. Let me put it this way. She burnt all of his Pokemon Trading Cards when we were younger just because she heard someone say that they were the Devil's Playing Cards. He had a 1st Edition Charizard. She was mad in my books.


So, Bogart's phone started ringing and we were in panic. What are we going to do? What are we going to say? I gave the phone to Tom and told him to stick to the story. Tell her we were at the cinema. This is how it went.

Tom picks up phone - ""Hello?""
Bogart's Mum - ""Bogart? Can I speak to Bogart please""
Tom - ""Well, Bogart can't talk to you at the moment. We were at the cinema watching a movie. During the intermission (Yes, we have intermissions in the middle of a movie in Malta) he told us that he was going to buy a coke and some snacks. He said he would be right back. The movie finished and Bogart never came back to his seat. We went looking around for him until we found him laying next to a garbage skip, unconscious. Now we're at Dylan's house. 
Bogart's Mum - *Bleep Bleep Bleep*. She hung up.

We just kept staring at Tom. His improvisation just made this whole ordeal worse.

All shit started breaking loose. In a space of a minute, we hid all of the evidence. The alcohol, the cigarettes, cups. We washed Bogart, no one wanted anything to do with his now hurly bushy penis, so we left that as that. We picked Bogart up off from the tub and dressed him up. Charlie and Eric bailed out. They said each of their parent's had arrived (Simultaneously), but we all know you guys were scared shitless!

To this day, I haven't seen a more dramatic scene then what was about to occur. Much more drama then a Martin Scorsese movie.

We hear four loud knocks on the door. The door never had received such a banging. I went to open the door, whilst diarrhea oozing out of my shorts. As soon as I opened, She rushed in yelling ""WHERE IS BOGART??"". She ran through the house. Found him in the bathroom just unconscious as he will ever be. She grabbed him by his shirt and lifted him up against the wall like it was nothing. ""WHAT DID YOU DO??"" *Slap in the face* ""WHAT DID YOU TAKE?"" *Harder slap in the face*. ""WHAT DID HE DO? WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM??"" We kept sticking to our stories and told her what Tom had already said to her. She dragged Bogart through the corridor, put him right next to the door, when Bogart's father arrived.

The man was inflamed. His face all red, gnashing his teeth together. What a sight that was. One handed, he grabbed him by his shirt, pulled him up, he didn't need a wall to support his dead weight, and started smacking him all over the face.

Bogart's Dad in a devilish tone - ""WHAAAAT DID YOUU DOOOO??""
""ANSWEEEEEEEEEEER MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE""
Bogart's Mum - ""NOOO DON'T HURT HIM!!"" (She had already slapped a tooth away)

After some more yelling, his dad picked him up and lifted him on to his shoulder, opened the door and his had rattled on the side of the solid wood door. All in total, he hit his head five times, not to mention all the slapping on his face. I thought to myself that it was finally over. Once again I was sadly mistaken.

Brian, Tom and I started to clean up the house. We went and threw all of the alcohol, cups, juices & cigarettes in a field a few minutes away from my house. Bogart left his wallet and phone behind so we went to give Bogart's parents his stuff back, only to be greeted by blue flashing lights. Bogart was getting stretchered into an ambulance and that is when we all realized that his condition could be worse then we had thought. It was really a heartbreaking site. Neighbors gathering outside, His mum crying her eyes out and his dad is still in shock. Brian went to give them his stuff back. They gave us this horrible stare like they were saying this is all your fault. Suddenly, I was struck with this immeasurable amount of guilt.

Tom decided to sleep over at Brian's house and I went back to my house to finish cleaning up and get some sleep. It was about 1 am and my parents still haven't arrived back home yet. I was in bed but my thoughts warn't allowing me to sleep. I felt like my mind was going crazy from all the guilt and worry I was feeling at the moment. I hear the telephone ringing. I picked it up and it was the doctor examining Bogart at the hospital. He told me to explain in detail what had happened. He obviously didn't buy it. He told me it would be near impossible to lift Bogart for that distance. He knew what he was talking about because we found it hard to lift him from the tub, let alone lift him for a 30 minute walk from the cinema to my house. Still, I kept to the story and he ended hanging up on me.

It was getting late and I managed to fall asleep, barely. Even in my dreams all I saw was guilt. I woke up at about 8 am and I find my mother in the hall way. The first thing she said was what is this smell of alcohol in the house? I couldn't keep it in. I told everything that had happened the night before. Better to tell her myself then to be told by someone else. My mum got all hysterical on my ass. Very dramatic woman my mum. Even remembering back I get agitated. My dad got woken up by my mum shouting at me. He seemed quite disappointed at me for not keeping my word about being left alone for a night. He seemed more disappointed by the fact that we woke him up at 8 am on a Sunday though.  
 
Being born as a Christian, I hadn't went to church in a few years. I called up Brian and told him to meet me outside so that we can go to Sunday mass. At that time I taught that maybe going to church would help in relieving me of this guilt I was still carrying.
Desperately, I pull a 5 euro note from my broke-ass 14 year old pocket and put it in the collection plate to make things right with God again. Haha.

Just about as the mass was finishing, I get a call from my Dad to meet up with him for a second. I got into the car and he explained to me that this stuff happens when you're young. That I needed to learn from my mistakes and not repeat them. To not feel so shitty about my self for what happened to Bogart. That he should of never drank that much in the first place. He told me ""Sounds to me you guys had a pretty solid night"". From that moment, I was relieved of all my guilt. I had never been treated like that from my father. He realized that I was growing up and that he couldn't treat me as if I was a child anymore. From that point on, I had a different relationship with my dad, quite different from the earlier 14 years.

As for Bogart, well.. I was told that he ended up in the hospital with a Grade 3 concussion, Alcohol Intoxication and a tube coming out of his mouth and penis. In the end, he recovered safely within a day. Brian got his internet connection disconnected as a request by Bogart's mum. She said Brian was a bad influence on Bogart and she didn't want him to communicate with him anymore. His dad plugged in the internet connection back again after 2 hours. Everyone else received a call from Bogart's mother, telling everyone's parents what had happened the night before. I ended up getting away scott free cos I had already spilled my guts out. 



Hope I didn't bore you with this long story for whom ever managed to read all of this.

TL;DR: Threw a house party.  5-7 shots of Vodka mixed with J&B,  Underage guest gets fucked up, penis vomit & concussions, ambulances & hospitals and a penis tube. 

Edit - WOW. WE MADE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE GUYS WITH 2500+ UPVOTES !!! I would of never have imagined such a huge feedback. I love you all guys. For the positive comments, the negative ones and those that are just plain weird. THANK YOU!!! Some of you really lifted me up today. Because of you guys, I now know that MAYBE I stumbled on a talent that I had gave up on. I'm my biggest critique and I don't belief in myself enough to have that role. I can't stress enough how much this feedback means to me. It truly makes me jubilant inside knowing that I made someone laugh today. But also try to learn from my mistakes so you wouldn't have to be in the same situation yourself. Things could of ended much, much worse.

Looks like I fucked up a bit. Forgot to mention that all names used in the story were all fictional due to keep all people involved in the story anonymous. Sorry if I misled anyone. I know how you all love Bogart's name. I picked Bogart just because I thought it would stand out.. and it did.

For all the haters, this story is 100% real. I wish that I was capable of writing a fiction story great as this.

A huge surge of comments are coming in. I can't keep up. I will reply to many of them when I get the chance.

I will be posting other crazy shit that happened to me on /r/tifu. So till next time Redditors!

Lets hear it one more time for Bogart!

Edit - THANK YOU WHO EVER GAVE ME REDDIT GOLD. Really appreciate it!!! 

"
3uv4cx,non_TBI,"This happened this past Thanksgiving weekend.

**Backstory**: I've been helping my GF move apartments this past week. We found a pair of handcuffs in her closet (a gag gift from her best friend), which I silently decided to keep for a rainy day.

**12AM**: Fast-forward to this past Saturday night, my girlfriend and I were headed to bed, one thing lead to another, and our clothes came off. Using my noggin to think creatively, I decided to bust out the handcuffs - nothing crazy or anything - but long story short my girlfriend's hands were chained to the bed post above her head while I went about my business (which went well for the both of us thank you for asking!).

Finally it came time to remove the handcuffs... which is exactly when I realized that these weren't exactly toy handcuffs (there was no quick-release button usually reserved for the toy variety, and they appeared to be made out of hardened metal), and that in my infinite wisdom, I had taken them without actually having the key to them.

**1AM**: Commence about 2 full hours of me apologizing profusely to my GF, looking up ""[pick your handcuffs with a bobby pin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqCW3qS9Qjg)"" videos on youtube which surprisingly were of no help at all for some reason, and trying to sever the links and finally the cuffs themselves with [metal cutters](http://imgur.com/gRBjN7b), to absolutely NO avail, I realized that I had myself in somewhat of a pickle. 

Throughout all of this, my girlfriend, bless her heart, was in surprisingly good spirits about the whole thing, despite her hands being chained to the post above her head, which was very uncomfortable, and lacking somewhat in the clothing department.

**3AM**: Having exhausted all at-home options and not wanting to call a specialist, I decided to break out my small handheld rotary dremel, with a spinning bit meant for cutting through tiny bits of metal. Long story short, after convincing my girlfriend that I would be safe about the whole thing and that she should remain still (I gave her safety goggles, and covered her hands with cloth), I was able to cut through the links that hold the handcuffs together, but not through the cuffs themselves. FREEDOM FROM THE BEDPOST AT LAST!

**4AM**: At this point we decided to get my GF dressed, and call a 24-hour locksmith. The cuffs around her wrists weren't an emergency, but by no means comfortable for her, and I was feeling really bad for her at this point. Locksmith didn't show (despite repeated calls), and we ended up falling asleep for the night, handcuffs and all.

**10AM**: Got dressed and headed for the nearest sex shop, to buy another pair of handcuffs, complete with key (from pictures online, the key seems pretty universal). Girlfriend decided to come with me since she was up by this point and wanted to come along for the ride. Of course the sex stores near us were closed on Sun, so we had to head a bit farther for some luck. 

**11AM**: Sex shop had plenty of handcuffs - though none with our exact brand. Apparently the ones on my GF were very old and from a company that was no longer in business... great. We bought the set with the closest-looking key, and tried it in the car. NO LUCK. Apparently while most handcuff keys look the same, the specific sizing varies by brand.

**12PM**: Found 2 more sex shops, still no luck (yes we did a lot of driving). Decided at this point to call more locksmiths, although this was a slightly more embarrassing prospect for my GF... no luck here as they were either 1) somewhat hesitant about the situation (potential ex-con or jailbreak), 2) thought it was a prank, or 3) had some unprofessional response like ""what've you been foolin around??"" in a rude way which made us uncomfortable.

**1PM**: Decided screw it, we're going to the police / fire station. This was by far the most embarrassing prospect for my GF, but with all of our options exhausted, we didn't want to go to the hospital, and I figured the police might have a matching key, or the fire station could cut them off. 

**2PM**: The people at the fire station were very professional, and had a matching key. My girlfriend came into the station after I gave her the OK, and they took them off. I guess the handcuffs we used were somehow police/criminal-grade, and their key worked perfectly with them. I asked the helpful fireman, an older gentleman, if he had seen this predicament before - he said no, gave us a genial smile, and didn't ask us any questions that would make an already-awkward situation even more awkward. I was somewhat surprised that they didn't run our information, but I guess my girlfriend didn't look like the felon type. Very very nice people overall. 

**3PM**: Took my girlfriend out to Sunday brunch. It's the least she deserved after being imprisoned by her BF on a sunny Thanksgiving weekend. The end!

**TL;DR**: handcuffed my girlfriend to the bed. firefighters had to save her.

EDIT: [proof](http://imgur.com/3TAK2pz)

EDIT 2: [more pictures](http://imgur.com/a/UFb6u) / [Link to the actual handcuffs model](http://www.armysurplus.com.au/showProduct/SECURITY/HANDCUFFS/HC0105A/American+Handcuff+Company+Handcuffs+-+Model+A-105)

EDIT 3: The comments got me researching the handcuffs a bit more, and i realized that they have a built-in [double-lock mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs#Double_locks). here is a [picture](http://imgur.com/sCrw85c) of the double lock on my set (the holes on the side along the black part are the double locking mechanism). I am thinking this could possibly explain why i had so much trouble picking the lock using the bobby pin approach, given that my first course of action was incidentally to engage the double lock using a pin, thinking it would be some sort of quick-release mechanism (similar to the 'reset' button on your modem). Oh well, the stupidity continues. Tried the shim technique on the broken cuffs today - it worked very well! Wish I had known about it earlier.

PS Looked closer at the engraving on the cuffs. It says ""**American Handcuff Co., Fond Du Lac, Wis**"". [A quick google search](http://www.officer.com/company/10028329/american-handcuff-co) tells me the company might still be in business, although their [actual website](http://www.americuf.com/) isn't working.

Girlfriend is in good condition and we had a good laugh about it all.

Thank you for reading yall!

3b75l0,non_TBI,"This happened only a few short hours ago. Being a teenager, I had all of my communications with the outside world removed. I'm at a friends house supposedly doing homework but I just had to get this fuck up out there. 

We're coming up to the end of the school year. In just a few short weeks, I'll be graduated from high school. Leave it to me, however, to find the best way to get into the most possible trouble. My friend and I always hang out. We've been best friends since I moved here last year. He has his license and I do not. Just got my learners driving permit here in canada so I'm still a year away from driving. But would that stop me from getting my own vehicle and traveling the roads?

No, and this is why I'm a fucking idiot. 

It was late night on Monday. No finals for the whole week, just free time to do whatever the hell I wanted. So I call up buddy, comes and picks me up and we go driving around. As we're driving, I mention to him I'm thinkin about trying to get a vehicle to boot around in. He thinks this is a great idea, but being that we're kids with no much money and my mom would likely go Luka Magnotta on a bitch, we weren't sure how we would do it. Than, *click* I have an xbox. Maybe someone would trade their shitty old truck for my xbox 360?

So we go back to my place, type up the ad, post it and wait. Not even 12 hours had gone by before I got a reply. An old guy wanted to trade is 1997 ford astrostar van for the Xbox. Fuckin sick!! So Tuesday night, buddy and I go to meet up with the van man. There it is in all it's glory. Burgundy red, square, no back seats, no middle seats, just a driver seat and a passenger seat. It ran. It drove. Like a dream! Only 123,000 kms on the thing!! No need to see anymore of this, I'm in. He takes the xbox. Gives me the keys to the van and away we go. 

For the next week days, i drove that thing around. Loud and proud. We managed to find a license plate that someone must have thrown away or stolen so we used that as the plate for the van. Yup, were idiots. On Wednesday night, we went to the Salvation Army where people typically take all the shit they don't want anymore and dump it there. There was a couch, probably 113.5 years old and when we saw it, we knew we had to have it. We threw it in the back. We now had our own party bus, equiped with old ass couches made of dust. But it was missing something. It needs exhaust. 

And that's what led to the fateful Thursday night. Buddy came over, with a hack saw. We caught the exhaust off and my god. The sound. So loud. So proud. So wonderful. We took er out for a test drive around the block once we chopped it. As we were driving, I decided I needed to turn around to go to the store we just passed. So I made a turn and headed there. However there was a car behind me now, not far. I panic. Maybe it's a cop. So I turn left. He turns. I turn right. He follows. I make a left into a cul-de-sac. He drives passed. Buddy and I quickly throw it in park, get out and start to walk. Not even 2 seconds after we got our and closed the doors, the car came back around the corner. It was a cop. He got out of his car and asked who drove the van. I told him it was me. He looked up the license plate as we stood there. He gets out of his car, walks to me, tells me to out my hands behind my back and they arrest me. 

Turns out, the license plate we used had been stolen off another vehicle and was being used by bank robbers as a false plate on their car. They had thrown this one away and stolen another one and we happened to be the idiots to find it. And use it. 

So the best part of it all is the shameless walk home for buddy. Since he did nothing wrong, the cop told him to leave. Basically just grabbed whatever he had in the van and started walking home. Just the thought of some 6'4"" blonde haired giant walking down the road with a hacksaw...it was awesome. 

So here I am. 3000$ in tickets, mom is possibly mulling over the idea of murdering me, buddy walking down the street with a saw and an 80% chance of never driving till I'm old enough to use my brain. Hopefully keep everyone updated. 

TL;DR: I'm the reason people are worried about the next generation of adults.

253a7j,non_TBI,"So I was snapchatting with this girl I knew for a while and things were getting a little heated. I get a snapchat from her with her showing her tits. The only reasonable thing to do was to send her a dick pic. So I send her the dick pic with the caption ""you like?"" and after maybe an hour without a response I text her asking if she didn't like my last snapchat. She says she never got a picture back. So now I'm like fuck fuck fuck who do I send that dick pic to and I go to check my history and the most recent update was the snapchat from the girl showing me her tits. My stomach immidiatly sunk because I knew what I did. I go to check my MyStory and there it was. For those of you who don't know what a MyStory is, you basically post pictures to it and everyone in your SnapChat contacts can see it, which includes about 50 of my friends and family, almost all of which saw my dick.

TL;DR: Sent a picture of my dick to my friends and family."
3kxh7v,non_TBI,"This is my first ever post on reddit, after being a serial lingerer, so forgive my formatting/everything else I inevitably do wrong.

In true TIFU fashion, I'll start by saying this didn't happen today, but 16 years ago, when I was in nursery. (I hadn't got around to making a reddit account back then.)

The FU happened during playtime one day, I was happily playing with a tray of beans, the easily amused child I was. I was temporarily unsupervised, and in a moment of pure genius, I decided that I would insert one of the beans - Into my **nose**. I did a good job of it too, none of the staff noticed. The day carried on like any other, I went home, had tea, went to bed, bean lodged in my nostril.

Noses are warm, damp places. The perfect location for a plant to grow. Long story short, the bean resided in my nose for a good few days, until my mother noticed a small green shoot in my nostril. I grew a bean. In my nose.

My mother took me to the GP, where the (presumably confused) doctor removed the bean, shoot & all from my nose, with an evil looking curved hook. I was terrified of the doctors for a few years, and I was put under constant supervision in playtime, lest I try my hand at gardening again.


TL;DR - Invented facial horticulture

3bcx47,non_TBI,"TIFU by tipping my Starbucks barista. 

I ordered my drink,  and looked in my wallet for a cash tip.  I had one $10 bill and one $1 bill.  I accidentally grabbed both and put them in the tip box.  I immediately said ""oops! My bad!"" and took the $10 out. 

Another customer in line saw this and accused me of stealing the $10 out of the tip jar.  I didn't hear him and walked off to go look at clothes with my daughter (the Starbucks is inside a Macys). 

Suddenly I had 3-4 customers yelling at me,  accusing me of taking the money.  An employee came out from behind the counter and confronted me about stealing it. I said no,  it was a mistake.  I put two bills in on accident.  She said okay and walked away.  

Every single customer was now staring at me as I stood there waiting for my drink to be made. One woman was staring and staring and staring and wouldn't stop.  I finally said ""Why are you staring at me? Do you honestly think I would steal out of a tip jar?""  she gave me a nasty attitude and the other customers started cursing at me.  Then the baristas all started talking trash about me. 

I started crying, saying I didn't take it out. 

I finally put the $10 back in the tip jar and yelled ""THERE.  IS EVERYONE HAPPY NOW"" and left. 

As someone with severe social anxiety and panic attacks based on exact situations like this, this was my worst nightmare. I'm never leaving my house again.

**EDIT** I can't thank everyone enough for the overwhelming support that I've gotten over the past 22 hours. I've never had Reddit Gold so I'm pretty sure this is the best day of my life. Definitely of 2015 (unfortunately I'm about to lose my mother to Alzheimers, so right now my anxiety level is at a 10 and 2015 has been honestly the worst year of my life). I have contacted corporate and waiting to hear back. Through your support I did get out of the house today (although I went to a completely different mall in another town) and didn't have a panic attack. Again I am thankful for every comment and message that I've received. I've never felt more support and love like this before and it's bringing me to tears so I'm gonna end this now. :')"
2xgt9v,non_TBI,"I've been married for almost two years. Last weekend, I decided I wanted to liven up our sex life. My husband works away from home one weekend a month, and I figured I would surprise him on Sunday evening when he walked in the door after having been away.

I bought some fun lingerie, applied some porn star makeup, curled my hair, and put on some hooker heels. We have a door in the kitchen that leads to the driveway, so I knew he would be coming in through that door. I figured, what could be sexier than my tired husband walking in the door after a long weekend of working to find his wife all dolled up and cooking dinner? 

Here's where I fucked up. My husband called me to let me know he was about 5 minutes away. In my giddiness, I grabbed the first vegetable near me and began chopping. 

It was an onion.

My husband walked in the door to find his wife, all dressed up and apparently bawling her eyes out over the cutting board. My porn star makeup had run down my face, and I could barely keep my eyes open. What's worse is I managed to roll my ankle while walking in my hooker heels to the kitchen sink. He didn't know whether to be concerned or turned on, as his half naked wife limped around the kitchen with tears running down her face. 

In my flustered state I blurted out something along the lines of, ""I'm making dinner!"". 

TL;DR Tried to surprise my husband by being sexy. He thought I was having a mental breakdown.

3esex0,non_TBI,"This happened less than twenty minutes ago. As I sit here typing with trembling fingers in the classroom where I teach ESL to adults, I cannot help but think that this is one of my most embarrassing teaching moments. 


Today I decided to wear my favorite burgundy-colored pencil skirt to class. This morning was a rough one; The type of morning where you barely drag yourself out of bed... and of course we were completely out of coffee.  So I half-consciously dressed myself, admire my outfit efforts in the mirror for a split second, and dart out the door late as usual. 


When I get to class my students were waiting patiently at their desks. Not wanting to waste any time, I walk up the the board and immediately begin to write and lecture. About five minutes into my lecture one of my female students from Colombia says, ""Excuse me, *teacher*..."" Irritated at the interruption, I retort, ""Yes, student? Remember I'll leave time for questions always."" ""No, your.. um... how do you call...?"" ""ZIPPER!"" say several other students to help the first. I turn around like lightning and feel with my hand that although the clasp still held, the zipper that ran from the top of the skirt all the way to the bottom of my butt was as wide open as the great outdoors.


I casually zip it up, thank the student, and^dead^inside continue my lecture as if nothing had happened. As soon as I get the class quietly working on an assignment I slip off to the bathroom to assess the damage. In the mirror I pull the zipper down like it was, and lift my arm mimicking myself writing on the board. To my horror my open zipper and closed clasp created a little keyhole from Satan that revealed my blue g-string and ass cheeks in all of their pasty glory. 



I am now back in class; red-faced and knowing that the memory of this will keep me up at night for years to come. 



**TL;DR If I don't zip the zipper, their teacher's a stripper.** 

Update: Class just let out. The last student out of the classroom just said, ""Blue is a good choice."" Winked, and darted out the door. 

Edit: I was really hoping that my 15 seconds of fame would be from something more noble than *this* crap, but c'est la vie. Beside the haters, the overwhelming majority of hilarious comments has made me feel a LOT better. 

**TIL**: ""Pics or it didn't happen."" Is Reddit's version of, ""Hey girl, bet you can't touch your elbows together behind your back.""
"
2mdm6v,non_TBI,"This actually happened this afternoon. Not very much backstory needed for this one, however I guess I should explain myself. 

Firstly - I'm lactose intolerant. Really badly lactose intolerant. If I have cheese, whey, pretty much anything with milk solids in it, I'll start blasting with wind like an involuntary ass trumpet. Diarrhea happens occasionally as well. The issue is that I really, really like brie.

Secondly - I was home alone today. My girlfriend had gone out to lunch with her friends and I thought I'd surprise her by cleaning the house whilst she was away. Who knows? It could have led to some grateful sexy times. At it turns out though, this was never to be.

Before I started, I spotted some brie in the fridge. It wasn't long into vacuuming that I started feeling churning. I farted a few times (relatively mildly), before an epiphany hit me: why don't I vacuum away my farts? The smell will be contained inside the bag and potential embarrassment in the future may be avoided. Without further ado, to maximise absorption, I undid my pants the next time I felt another gas wave hit me.

So began the biggest mistake of recent memory. It turns out that between the negative pressure of a vacuum and the positive pressure of a fart, that the effect was stronger than anticipated. As the fart arrived, the gas was rapidly absorbed into the vacuum tube - along with the end segment of my large intestine.

Unsurprisingly, this hurt a fucking lot. I immediately turned off the vacuum and tried to push my sphincter back inside my ass - turns out that doesn't work, and it also hurts a fucking lot too. Not long after, my girlfriend arrives home. I avoid explaining why I'm in the bathroom for a while, but eventually I come clean. She laughed way too much before realising shit was serious.

I'm in hospital now, being prepped for surgery to reconstruct my ass. Seriously people - as smart as you might feel about vacuuming away your farts, just don't do it.

TL;DR - I vacuumed out my rectum trying to contain a fart.

Edit (11/22): I just logged into my throwaway after being off reddit and high on medication. Just checked this. Goddammit. "
2uhh51,non_TBI,"Today I fucked up by getting my dick and balls waxed. I have a girlfriend and we've been dating for a month exactly. I commented on how beautiful her pussy was and how smooth and she said it was because she gets waxed. She told me it hurt to have done and I joked with her about how next time she goes I would get one, to show solidarity.

So the day comes when she's going to get waxed and she calls ahead and asks if they wax men, and they are like, sure. This is where my plan fell through because I was 100% sure they didn't do this sort of thing for men. But they do! Yay!

We end up going to the salon and I'm very nervous but I figure I'm going through with it. She gives me an out and says I don't have to but I tell her, I told you I would so I'm doing it.

So this actually attractive woman in her late 20's comes and gets me (I was expecting some woman in her 50's with a Swedish accent and hands bigger than mine) and takes me in the back and tells me to get naked. Which I do and she asks me to get up on the table. I lay down on the table with my male bits dangling out. My nuts for some reason decide to hang down to my knees which they don't tend to do very often so in that regard I feel betrayed.

She starts putting wax on the lower part of my stomach and rips. Holy fucking mother of all that is evil, who the fuck does this to themselves, I think, as a mixture of pins and needles covered with burning lava assaults me, as this tiny women hurts me in ways I never thought someone her size could. Then she keeps doing it and it doesn't hurt any less, when she said it gets better she was a fucking liar.

Then something strange happens, she starts grabbing my dick and moving it around to wax around it. Obviously my penis is confused about whats going on, it's been around wax before in a different type of setting and it thinks this is the right time to show off. So here I am with this woman fondling my penis as it slowly decided to become erect, because when you have hairs ripped out of your body that's the time to get erect, right?

This is one of the least erotic moments of my life to be honest. She starts to do my nuts, well when I said it couldn't hurt worse, I lied! It hurts worse and this woman has a strange habit of slapping me after she pulls a slab of wax up, she lightly keeps slapping me where ever she just ripped my hair out, as if to say, bad boy, bad boy for letting me do this to you and she does this on my nuts. Not pleasant to have the hair ripped off your scrotum then have some obviously sadistic woman start slapping them playfully afterwards. 

Fuck me, this could not get worse, it does though! The bottom inch of my penis has hair on it, so obviously that shit has to go. So she rips the hair out of my penis and slaps it and well that wasn't so bad really. My penis has been confused by her holding it so much. She does it again and bam, she rips that shit off, then slaps it lightly again and my penis is thinking, shit that actually was kinda nice. Next thing I know Mr. Happy is jumping around spitting cum all over the place. The nice woman starts to laugh and puts her hand under my penis catching most of my cum still laughing so hard I think she's going to cry.

I apologize and apologize and apologize and apologize. She is still laughing and takes a towel and cleans me up and she tells me I didn't do anything wrong it's a natural reaction, all while milking my cock. I'm like, cool, so other people have done this? She laughs and says, Hell no, you're the first one but still you're alright, don't be embarrassed.

She has me get up on all fours and then she waxes my ass crack and the rest of my balls. Yeah, that was actually the highlight of my day.

So she keeps waxing going over little bits as she feels around my nether regions and finally she finishes the job and you would think my penis would just stop doing this shit but no it stays erect the whole time even after cumming. She finishes by putting oil on me at the end and massages it in, even my erect penis, jerking it for a bit and then just like that it's over. She takes a towel and wipes off all the oil and other stuff off me.

She gives me her card and tells me to come back when it's grown about an 1/8th of an inch for another wax. I say, for sure. 

I'm never going back again ever, obviously.

She takes me up front to pay and my new girlfriend is waiting and she asks me how bad it was. I say, it wasn't so bad. The first of many lies I will take to my grave over that day.  I tipped the salon woman $20.00 for being cool and not wigging out and having me arrested. Sometimes I hate my penis.

The woman who waxed me tells my GF I was awesome during the whole thing and that she will love my new look. Which was true she loves it and it's not so bad being bald down there. But at what cost for my hubris? Scarring some poor salon worker for eternity seems like a big price to pay.

TL;DR: Promised to wax for GF, stimulated by pain and cums over 20 something woman waxing OP. Tips $20.00 to stay out of jail. credit to /u/terryw0gan for brilliant tl:dr.

45xc14,non_TBI,"To see the original click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/45fkss/tifu_by_ruining_a_300000_piece_of_art/)

I walked into work today at 7am after ruining a $300k piece of art last Wednesday. I had a meeting with my curator that reassured me that I wouldn't lose me job. He told me that next time I was sick, I should tell him. I asked him what about Linda. He told me not to worry about her. I carried on with my day, anxiously waiting for the weekly work meeting that Linda usually heads. It usually starts at noon, but the curator started it early cause some big shipment was coming in. Long story short, he told us Linda resigned, and will be going on to 'bigger and better things' and we should all keep her in our thoughts. Now the curator is in charge of everyones schedule/requests for time off and he has his favorites, which I'm one of. Now half of my co-workers hate me, and I can't walk into a room without getting dirty looks.

TL;DR - RIP Linda and me"
3q2cwa,non_TBI,"Technically it was last night, but it crossed over into this morning so it counts. And it's not some humblebrag ""I got laid but then x happened."" I'm actually can't recall ever having felt this worthless in my life.

She drove, we chatted, I made my interest apparent. She seemed to reciprocate. As the night went on and the liquid courage started loosening everybody up, she started getting kinda flirty and feely with a lot of people. Should have been my red flag to get the hell out. Nope.

We ended up at another house with two guys who we had been hanging out with at the party. Me and guy #2 played FIFA while she sat on the couch with guy #1. They ended up making out. I figured they were going to have sex and I would just have to live with it because she was my ride home.

Guy #1 gets up and taps guy #2 on the shoulder, and whispers something into his ear. Guy #2 sets his controller down, tells me ""it's all you dude."" She's on the couch cheesing, and the three of them all head down the hall into the same bedroom. I was still in denial until I heard the bed shaking and her squealing. I sat numb for maybe five minutes before going outside and smoking cigarettes until they made me sick. Tried to go back inside and lay down, but I made it maybe five minutes before I decided I had to go home. It was about a two hour walk. I'm pretty sure I'm not leaving my bed today.

tl;dr - Got to hear my crush banging two guys at once and had to walk home.

edit - To the people who keep calling her ""whore,"" ""slut,"" ""bitch,"" etc, I don't agree with you and you're really not helping anything at all.

edit 2 - She keeps trying to call me. I really see no benefit to anyone in answering.

edit 3 - There is just no way I'm going to be able to keep up with all these replies. I'm going to call her and add an edit here later.

edit 4 - I'm familiar with the red pill and I won't be joining them, so you can save those suggestions.

edit 5 - TIFU by calling my (former) crush back the night after having heard her bang two dudes in the other room. Claimed she wanted me in there too. So I asked the obvious question, and she says she was drunk and it didn't work out the way she intended. Decided to just go with it when I didn't get involved. Passed out when it was over. Was worried about me, never meant to hurt me, bla bla bla. It helped nothing at all, as I don't really know what I can believe and what I can't.

I've seen a few suggestions implying that it may have been rape or that I should have tried to ""save"" her. The fact is that she practically led *them* down the hall, she was visibly damn happy, and sexual pleasure has a pretty distinct fucking sound. I wasn't going to sit around and listen for it to go south, nor was I going to burst in to what was pretty clearly a consensual sexual encounter that I didn't believe myself to be welcome in just to make sure everything was okay. If you guys want to start barging into the room anytime you hear people fucking at parties, be my guest. I'm not doing that though.

Whatever. Fuck this noise. Told her I don't hate her but I don't think we should talk anytime soon. Apparently now I have a party to get to tonight. You guys are certainly free to keep bitching about what a ""whore"" she is if that's what you want to do though.

edit 6 - I'm reading all your replies, but sadly, it's just impossible for me to reply to everyone. You guys are great though. Thanks for being awesome, reddit."
2d8k3t,non_TBI,I was driving home on a small residential street and noticed some cheerleaders practicing right off the side of the road. They were straight ahead and I had to make a left turn. I was still kind of glancing back at them while making the turn and didn't see caution sandwich board thing construction workers use to mark their work area. I ended hitting the sign and sinking my front left tire into a pothole full of hot blacktop. I'm thinking I'm going to get my ass kicked by some construction workers when one of them approaches me asking me if me and my car are ok. I told him I was fine and very sorry. He said don't worry about it. We were watching them too.
3bn5cc,non_TBI,"As with all good fuck ups, this didn't happen today. It happened yesterday. I am a twenty year old female, and it was my first flight alone. I have flown before, but always sandwiched between a squalling baby brother and a fidgety little sister. Meanwhile, my parents  would sit in the row ahead, never looking back, as they try to simultaneously ignore  us and pretend the pint sized Asian circus is not their creation


Yesterday was a toss up. Instead of siblings, I was sandwiched between an elderly, married man, and an elderly businesswoman as we hurtled in the sky towards San Francisco. The man read his book and the woman fiddled with a pen.

I have an old Nintendo Gameboy color, and Pokemon Crystal. The save file is corrupted, but I decided to see how far I could get in the upcoming 3.5 hours. Being a considerate chair neighbor, I pulled out my earbuds and plugged them  into the bottom hole thing. I turn on the game and then slowly increase the volume. It's odd, I'd thought the music would be louder as the classic Pokemon music can be almost piercing on full volume, but i shrugged it off. It is an old Gameboy, after all. Cue the classic Pokemon music and the dramatic fight scene segments.

A little while into the game, I'm level seven with my chickorita, but my neighbors seem distressed. The man kept glancing up and me and glaring; his fingers drummed against the book he was so gently holding minutes ago. Maybe an hour in, Businesswoman looks irritated. She cast a glance at me and kept readjusting in her plasticky seat, so I sent her an empathetic ""this flight sucks, I know the seats are uncomfortable"" look.

Two hours in, and I was conquering the game. EV training meant I was battling frequently with the classic ""dodododododododo bu bum bu du bum bum"" music. The music still wasn't playing too loudly, but that was fine. I was starting to get sick of the repetitive music. . I rolled the music down to zero and went to unplug my earbuds. It wasn't fully plugged in. 

My stomach plummeted and I could feel a flush rising. Dear God, OldMan and Businesswoman must hate me. I sank into my seat and tried not to look at them. 2 hours. Two hours they and the whole plane had to hear me play Pokemon. There is no way to apologize. The only solution was to feign sleep for an hour.

**TL;DR: I unwittingly shoved nostalgia down the ears of an airplane full of people for two hours straight**

**Holy shit, I drop my shame off here and go to explore SanFran and now look at this lovely shit show. You've popped my gold cherry... TWICE! The hell is wrong with all of you? Taking pleasure in the pain of the older.... (Op uses shame)**"
3olk2x,non_TBI,"So I was at my local climbing gym, and talking to one of the guys down there who I know half well and in conversation he revealed he did magic. As most people would be, I was pretty interested so I said something along the lines of 'Go on, show me your magic then!' So this guy replies 'No, it's embarrassing man!' But I cajole him into it. So he takes me over to his locker and reaches into his bag and pull out what I assume is, I don't know, a special box of cards or some props to do a magic trick with.

It wasn't. It was a box of Magic cards, as in, a card game I'd never heard of before, and now this guy thought I was some sort of expert on the matter because I'd been pushing him for about 5 minutes to show me. I ended up spending half an hour pretending I had a clue what the fuck he was showing me as he pulled various good (?) cards out of his deck.

TL;DR: Asked a guy to show me his magic. He did. Oh boy he did."
2kh1yv,non_TBI,"This actually happened over the weekend.

The drywall behind the tiles in my bathtub rotted out, the tiles fell off into the tub and broke. As I am a single father (engaged but she's not really a ""step mother"" my sons are older, 17 and 18), I'm super busy all the time. It has taken forever to find time to schedule a guy to come out and patch up this hole. 

Finally, I get a guy to come out last Friday afternoon. He starts to get to work and has to pause to run out to his truck to get another tool or whatever he needed and came back, had it all patched up within half an hour.

A few hours later, my fiancee tells me she needs to go to the emergency room. She has had bronchitis for damn near a week and was afraid it had progressed to pneumonia. We go to the ER, they get her a chest x-ray some breathing treatments and a prescription for antibiotics. We get home around 3:30 am.

I get my fiancee into bed, then nature called and I head to the bathroom.

I hear my cat crying. He's a big maine coon and the biggest baby ever. He sounds like a baby kitten when he meows, and I hear him crying his little kitty eyeballs out.

I figure the big dumbass a has gotten himself locked in a cabinet - again -have I mentioned he's a big dummy? So I'm frantically checking all the cabinets in the bathroom, the kitchen, under the kitchen sink and he's nowhere. His crying is getting more and more pathetic.

That's when I realized the crying was coming from inside the wall. The best I can figure, this dumb little shit had crawled inside the hole in the wall while the contractor was outside and remained in there hiding somewhere while the guy did his work.

So, here I am at 4 am with a cat stuck inside the wall meowing in the most heartbreaking and pathetic way he possibly can.

The only choice I had was to take a hammer to my freshly patched up tile wall in the bathtub and break him out.

Pictures of the little shit here:

Okay so this was about 6 months ago, but my boyfriend just reminded me of it. Stayed round his house and he climbed out of bed (over me) because there's a wall on his side. I'm a ridiculously heavy sleeper but he actually woke me up for once. 

My face felt all hot and wet so I stumbled out of bed, half awake, to go and use the bathroom to investigate what was up. I was leaning on the wall with my cheek resting against the corner of it because I felt a little lightheaded, so my face was kind of peering round the wall at the bathroom door. I couldn't remember where the light switch was so I just waited in the dark. 

Boyfriend opens the door, the light makes me squint so I cover my eyes, and then he screams. It was the most terrified scream I've ever heard, and looking back on it, it's pretty amazing that a 6'2"" bearded, tattooed guy can reach that note. 

Turns out I'd had a bitch of a nose bleed in my sleep, and my whole face was covered in blood from where I'd most likely smudged it in my sleep on the pillow. It had also trailed from my face onto my white nightie, and that combined with my insane bed hair meant that I looked pretty fucking terrifying. I'm no longer allowed to wait in the hall if I want to go pee after him. He also refused to face me when he went to sleep for a while... and he had to scrub my blood off the wall. 

TLDR; had a nose bleed without realising, waited to use the bathroom in the dark, boyfriend came out and screamed when I had blood all over my face in the hall when he thought I was asleep."

3epx49,non_TBI,"(This happened a few months back. AFMBIFU.)

So, I am addicted to Candy Crush on my iPhone but refuse to pay for any extra lives or power ups or whatever. This means when you've played 5 turns, you have to wait a few hours until they refill and you can play again. 

I was doing this like a chump for several years: play 5 turns, wait a few hours, play 5 turns, wait a few hours, etc. Then I heard about a workaround where you can reset your phone clock forward an hour and Candy Crush thinks it's time to give you another life. Woohoo! Free lives. I did this a few times in the evening.

This was fine until my phone alarm alarm went off in the morning at 6am, my usual time to get up and start getting my 8 year old son ready for school. I go shake him awake. He's strangely difficult to wake up this morning. I shake him harder. Finally he half opens his eyes and says 'is it morning already?' He drags himself out of bed and zombie-walks to the living room where I put some cereal in front of him and he turns on a Netflix cartoon.

He is still half asleep trying to eat his cereal, and I think, ""maybe he's getting sick, he shouldn't be this tired."" Then I open up my computer to read with a morning coffee, and I glance at the computer clock. 3:15am. It took a moment to figure out that my '6:00' alarm had gone off at 3:00 thanks to my Candy Crush phone-time clock cheating. 

I sent my poor kid back to bed for a few more hours of sleep. I was already awake by then though, so I just kept on reading reddit. "
32g2gb,non_TBI,"So last night I am in charge of doing my 5 year old girl's bed time while mum takes baby to sleep. While picking a bed time story I go through the pile of recently acquired library books and see one titled ""Ghost Hunters and the incredibly revolting ghost"". It looked a bit above her pay grade and I question who picked it out and if she thought it might be a bit too scary for her.  
She says no and being a bit hyped up from the weekend and feeling playful she declares that it might be a bit scary for me and comes up with a game on the spot: a scare test. She turns out the light and pounces on me. Now I should mention we have black out blinds and with the light off the room is completely dark.  
What follows is 5 minutes of us turning out the lights and trying to ""scare"" each other i the dark: throwing fluffy toys, sneaking up behind, ""monster"" drool, wet willies. After a while of gentle escalation I figure its time to end this and get to bed.  
On my turn I go silent. After 10s  
""daddy?""  
*Silence*  
""d..d.daddy??""  
*Silence*  
""where are you!!?""  
*Silence (oh this is good!)*  
""DAD!!?""  
*Silence (yeah I'm in the zone)*  
Footsteps towards the lightswitch  
*Wait for it, oh I'm so going to win this. Kneel down so I'm at head level, wait for it, wait for it, ok she's right in front of me, lets do it!*  
Lights on: ""RAAAAAGHHHHAAAHHHH!""  
""Aieeeee!""   
*thhhppbbbb*  

So yeah bedtime was delayed for a wardrobe change.  
She's probably not going to trust me for a while  
and as a bonus we woke the baby too....  
  

-------------------------------------------------
Update (and edit for an apostrophe which apparently is really important):  
For anyone 'worried' about any psychological scarring.    
I was 'surprised' today by my girl jumping out from under the dining table when I got home from work today. Apparently she wanted to get me back and hid under the table. Being that she had decided that quite a while before I got home she'd turned under the table into some kind of den with books, pillows, and snacks. So everyone is laughing and no-one was harmed.   
  
For anyone asking about my wife's response.  
Luckily she was pre-occuppied with resettling the baby and fell asleep doing so and thus didn't hear the details till the day after where upon it was established that no harm was done and thus I didn't need to be castrated or otherwise mutilated.

This morning  I decided to got to one of those fancy carwash places where they have about 10 people cleaning and drying your car after it gets out of the automatic wash. I drive a large pickup truck, a 4 door Nissan Titan and I keep the rear seats up so my dog has more room. So after they were done drying the truck they waved me over and I started to drive away, I got about a half mile down the road and I see someone in the rear of the cab, still drying the inside of the windows. It scared the shit out of me and I screamed, then the guy screamed and I ended up swerving on the Highway and cut off a car in the next lane. There happened to be a police officer behind me who saw it all and turned on his lights and pulled me over. The good news was the cop believed me,  because the truck was still dripping and the Mexican dude had a spray bottle and rag. The police officer gave me a written warning and had a good laugh. I tried to give the cleaner a ride back to the car wash and he just said to me ""No mas"" and turned and quickly walked away. https://soundcloud.com/the-theme-song/the-car-wash (credit goes to /u/TheThemeSong )  Written warning: www.imgur.com/A4UYF12"
2uprjj,non_TBI,"This fuck-up actually happened just a couple hours ago...

So as many of you might know McDonalds is doing the promotion of paying with love, I happened to be one of the lucky ""winners"" of this promotion. It was great a $15 Mckey'D's food binge for free, man I coulnd't believe my luck! They said all I had to do is call a family member and tell them ""I love you"".

The start of the fuckup is calling my mother who knows that I had a breif history with depression and suicidal thoughs from high school bullies, the second fuckup is starting the call with I love you.

She immediatly started to freak out (mostly because I'm over 1000 miles  away from her and the closest family is about 300 miles away from me) and was pretty scared that I was about to commit suicide. Over the course of the next 15 minuets I was on the phone reassureing her that I indeed wasn't about to kill myself and make sure that she wasn't on the next plane to arrive and come to visit. (Afterwards she also mentioned that it had given her a small asthma attack, but nothing her inhailer couldn't handle)

Overall it wasn't the worst thing that has happened, and the McDucks manager that was helping me thought it was so funny she paied for the other guys meal I was with along with handing me a handful of free sandwich coupons because it was the best laugh she has had at this job.


**TL:DR** :Went to McHeartAttack to get free food and nearly gave mother a heartattack


**Edit** : Thanks to /u/Adamjc53 for fixing the TL:DR and holy shit did this blow up, I'll be doing my best to reply to most if not all of the comments.

Front page as well? Sweet! Posted this about an hour before I went to bed so I wasn't able to reply to everyone's comment, that is going to happen ASAP.

For everyone saying the manager was rude/being an asshole, truthfuly, after the fact I thought it was pretty damn funny myself, not only did it make her night a little more entertaining/interesting I got more free food then I origionaly throught I was going to get.

**EDIT 2** apparently this has made radio stations across America and several websites quote this word for word. I guess everyone was just waiting for it to backfire and it did.

I was very constipated and I had not pooped for four days. In order to to solve this situation, i bought a pack of D....lax, which, according to the instructions, should start working 6 hours after beeing taken. My belly was bloated and as i considered the problem to be severe, I took three pills at about 4 pm. When i came home at 7 pm, my roommate offered to take me with her in an hour. 1 had never taken a laxative before, i used to take only dried plums, prune juice, psyllium husk, soda or sugar-free food wich would usually restore the normal order within a day. I thought that the contents of my bowels would just move down faster and remain at their solid consistency. I expected to feel the urge to go after 6 hours and i thought that i would either be able to stay after a visit to the bathroom or that i could easily make it home. When i went to the bathroom before we departed, i did not feel the urge to poop despite trying. I had no reason the expect the events that were to come. 

The party took place in a neighbouring block of flats. About thirty people attended and it was fairly crowded. I generally enjoyed it, but remained in a quiet corner and did not drink. My misery begann at about 9 pm. At first it was just a little cramp and i just thought that my period was about to start early. Five minutes later it was as if something was moving inside my belly. It could feel the right side becoming lighter while something was flowing to the left side. I still did not feel any pressure. There was just this tense feeling and my lower bottom started to get somewhat warm. It remotely felt as if i was getting horny, but i had just been looking at a bottle on a desk for the last minutes. Then suddenly, a diffuse feeling of something pushing against my rectum became urgent. I stood up and made my way towards the bathroom, but this just increased the pressure. Upon reaching the bathroom, i soon found it to be not useable: On completely drunk guy was sitting on the toilet with his pants down and someone was laying on the floor and in the shower. I was not drunk, I had decency, so abusing the sink was out of question. As is rushed out of the bathroom, i came to the realisation, that I only had few minutes to find a place to relieve myself. I rushed out of the flat and began to search for something. There were no secluded corners or cabinets. Then i noticed that that block had the same layout as our block and that our block had escape stairs from the floors. After a short run, i reached the door to the stairs, that is hidden behind a corner. It was just a short run away, but i was not sure that i was going to get there in time. When i tried to open the door, it wouldn't. After a few seconds of shock, i realised, that i was pushing instead of pulling. Once i got out, i contemplated my action. The platform has a floor that is esentially a metall grate. The stairs down were blocked by a door that only opens downwards. If i went down there, i would not get back up again. I also would have not be able to get back inside, as the door to into the building could only be opened from the inside. I could have gone onto the stairs upwards, but i was afraid that someone could see me there.

My butt was hurting badly. The pain was similar to a muscle, that is strained after lifting something heavy. The pain was stronger than my desire to find the least problematic place. I lowered my pants and went into a squatting position. It was a quiet, slightly rainy night. I could faintly hear the music from the flat i had just run out of. From my position on the sixth floor, i could overlook the area. Noone was there.  I just stopped holding it in and the thought of the relief that was to come was only disturbed by the smell of cigarette smoke. It was as if my butt was forced open by a garden hose that was hidden inside it. There was a continuous and heavy flow for at least ten seconds. There were a few tiny solid pieces that caused pain as they hit my butthole while exiting. I was shaking so much that when i began to pee it would not even flow continuously. Although i was not completely empty, and a burning feeling arose in that region, I felt light again and my bloated belly was turning into its graceful, skinny figure again. Suddenly, there was a voice: „Did the gutter tear or something?“. A second voice, apparently a girl, added „My neck is wet“. I realized that i was caught. I put my hands on my stomache to increase the pressure to finish as soon as possible when a voice down there said „Someone is up there“. A flashlight flashed up from below, i was scared and then the second wave came out of me. Below me, a scream rose through the night: „Shit, thats shit“. „He's shitting on us“ - „No dude, do you see that? That's a girl“.  I  quickly wiped with a tissue that i already had at my hands. The flashlight from the platform on the floor below me was still lighting up. They could see enough to make a rude comment about my labia. I put another tissue over my butthole like a pad, put on my pants again and rushed back inside.

The flat was only a few doors away. I had left the door open, so i  left myself back inside. I had only been gone for a few minutes and as i knew only few people, noone seemed to have noticed that i was gone. I was planning on leaving, as i was not feeling well. I went to pick up my cardigan that i had left at the place i had been sitting at. When i was about to get out. Someone was yelling outside and knocking at the door. I rushed back as far as possible.  Someone had opened the door. The person that opened the door started screaming against the people yelling from outside. Alarmed from the screams, the people from inside the flat rushed to the door. The situation turned into chaos. Standing outside were the people i had just pooped on. As everyone who is screaming gibberish while beeing covered in poop, they presumed to be crazed and their attempts to come in were fended off with a broom. Within seconds, the whole floor showed up. The situation did not calm down, the people outside were looking for the person that did this. I did not see them, but i heard people saying that the were covered in feces. I went onto the balcony, when someone from the neighboruing flat went into their balcony and started yelling down for help. This attracted further audience from outside. The people outside could be convinced to return to their flat. I used the first opportunity to escape. Many people were rushing up the stairs to see the outraging situation and despite looking very normal, i expected any of them to identify me as the culprit.

When i returned to my flat, i cleaned myself up and pooped some more. My roommate returned two hours later, she showed me some photos she had made of the poor people below me. I had completely hit them – two guys and one girl. I went to bed shortly afterwards. Rumors about the event spreaded quickly on Facebook. My unintentional victims apparently gave a description to the building management, that caused amusement – they were looking for a girl with a blue skirt, when interested people asked for a more precise description, the word „shaved“ was used in official notices. Luckily, their description was not correct, they mistook my blue shirt for a skirt.

TL;DR : I took a laxative, underestimated the effects and my poop got over other people.

**Minor Update & Further Details:** It seems that i have avoided all suspicion so far. When time has passed, i will probably tell my roommate who is by the way functioning as my best friend. As far as i could find out, my poor victims were slightly drunk and can not remember every detail. I know their names and their door numbers and in the next days, i will send them gift cards for the communal launderette. Pictures of them were deleted off Facebook and other Social Media. One of their friends has commented on Facebook that they wish their identities to be kept secret. This has not stopped people from spreading the news. I heard people talking about the incident when i went to my classes, but as it is with rumors, the details are changing and sometimes obscure additions are made. I don't know if it is true, but it was said that my poor victims made it into a flat and - as noone wanted to get near them - managed to corner the people inside there before they could convince them that they had nothing to do with their misery. It also appears to be, that there were multiple parties on that floor, so the speculations are not even sure where the culprit came from. 

I'd like to thank the kind stranger who gifted me gold and everyone who gave me suggestions for my health. I strongly suspect that the cause for my constipation was my period, which started early today. I still have classes for today and as cramps won't be the only nuisance, there is a small probability which will hopefully not realize itself, that similar events are going to occur. "
3hmb4p,non_TBI,"I'm a kindergarten teacher that started the school year last week.  Everyday, the students have a 10 minute snack time.  During this time, I play read alouds of children's books on YouTube while I walk around assisting in opening milk cartons and such.  

We just got done listening to a read aloud of Green Eggs and Ham and I saw a suggestion for The Giving Tree.  I asked my students if they have ever heard of this book and they said no.  Hooray!  I get to be the one that introduces them to one of my favorite books! 

So I click on the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQtIx1V9QQc) and continue walking around, doing my snack time duties.  After about a minute into the video I think to myself, ""Huh...I don't remember this part.""  Then, the bomb drops at 1:22.  I rushed to the computer to turn it off, but it was too late.  Some students were screaming, some were crying and I was ready to sign a letter of resignation.  I called all the parents that night and told them about the mistake.  Fortunately they took it well, but I'm pretty sure I ruined The Giving Tree for my students.  =("
3tp8ts,non_TBI,"So, technically this fuck up has been going on since I purchased the blinds THREE YEARS AGO, but I just realized today that they do not work properly. 

My room is essentially windowed all the way around, with about two feet (edit: definitely not two feet, I'm no good with measurements, it just comes up to pretty much my hip) worth of wall, so the walled section comes up to maybe my hip. 

I have these awesome bamboo type blinds that I love because they don't block the sun out entirely, they let a bit in which is nice to wake up to...  And should have been my first hint. 

As my other fuck ups will tell you, I like to be naked and I'm very comfortable with my body. So, I live alone and, naturally, I walk around naked a lot and get changed in the middle of my room. 

The windows look out onto an alley of the condo building where the parking garage also is. While changing, I often look out to see who is parking in our building and I notice the cars always slow to almost a stop, then continue. I figured there was a speed bump or something. 

Fast forward to early this morning when I accidentally left my bedroom light on when I left. I walk out the side door, walk down the alley and turn to look back at my room - - with the light on you can see EVERY DETAIL OF MY ROOM. You can literally see the tack on my wall where I'm meaning to hang a picture. 

So, all and all, I've been dancing naked, getting changed and doing God knows what else in full view of everyone driving down the alley.... Oh, and the giant apartment building across from the condo. 

TL;DR : blinds don't work when the light is on, I've been exposing myself to potentially hundreds of people every day for three years."
2y13c4,non_TBI,"So, like most, this didn't happen today. Or Yesterday. Not even this year.

In 2010 it was the second quarter of my freshman year of college. It was a pretty typical friday night: I found myself playing beer pong with a person I didn't know and I house I'd never been before and drinking something that I wasn't quite sure of. We had been playing for what seemed like an eternity when I notice two girls from my dorm walk into the room. I am shitfaced by this point and I call out to them despite not knowing them very well.

They come over and we talk about dumb shit such as what're you drinking, do you know of any other parties, etc. One of the girls is maybe the most beautiful girl I've ever seen (sober). The other is... homely, we'll call her A.

So at some point in the conversation A asks her friend if she wants to go dance. She says no since she and I are having an intelligent conversation about the finer points of beer pong. I ask A why she doesn't just go ask a guy to dance with her. She says that she's afraid of being turned down. This is were I fuck up.

Quick point: I can barely stand straight.

I start laying down the most inspirational speech I have ever heard. I tell her to go out and dance and if guys don't want to dance then they are friggin idiots since they don't know what they're missing. She is a strong, independent, beautiful woman who doesn't need the validation of any man to have a good time. I continue for about 15 mins of motivational rambling.

Afterwards she looks at me, I can still see the sparkle of admiration in her eyes, and says, ""Wow, thanks brochill! Would you want to go dance with me?""

""Nah."" And I turn around and keep playing beer pong.

Tl:dr I helped a girl with her confidence, only to immediately reinforce her doubts and shatter it.

EDIT: Wow, this blew up. I'm glad some many people find humor in my moment of obliviousness.

EDIT 2: The Re-Editing: Thanks for the gold, stranger! I feel vastly superior to everyone else already."
30iplc,non_TBI,"I apologize in advance for the sloppiness I'll update when I get to my hotel. 

I'll cut to the chase by saying that once I got boarded on my flight to Florida I started to get a little hungry. No big deal I thought since I have some sugar less gummy bears to eat. (I know it sounds gross, but I'm hungry/trying to eat healthier). Well once I oppened the 1 pound bag of them immediately the teenager next to me asked if he could have some. I didn't care because I talked to him once we were borded and he seemed pretty chill plus that bag was one pound and there was no way I was going to do it by myself. 

We're going to town on this bag because they aren't that bad actually. I'm sitting in the window seat and this kid is sitting next to me in the isle seat and across the isle is his little brother ( less than 2 years old if I had to guess) and his mother next to him in the window seat across the plane. The toddler is getting all curious so the the teen next to me begins to tear the bears in little pieces to let him have some. Again I didn't really care because the whole family was pretty chill. 

By now all three of us are eating some and the bag is running low. The teen showed no signs of stopping so I just asked if he wanted the rest. He agrees and takes it while I try to get some shut eye. The teen follow suit and asks his mom if she wants to keep tearing the little bears up to feed to the garbage disposal of a toddler. The mom starts snacking on them while simultaneously feeding the toddler some. I didn't think much of it because I started to actually fall asleep.

I woke up with the worst feeling in my stomach not 30 minutes later. I take the small blanket I had off over my face and all three of the family memebers are nowhere to be seen. At this point they could have fallen out of the fuckin plane and I wouldn't have cared becaue my stomach was feeling like it was hitting the abort button like I was having the mcgurrgles. I get up and make my way to the bathroom at the front of the plane and I spot the teen that was sitting next to me banging on the door actually Fucking crying. I start to put two and two together that it might be the gummy bears since we all are some. Well after banging on the door the mom and toddler finally come out in a rush with the mother looking like she just served in Vietnam. She's sweating like crazy and starts asking me what the fuck I put in those gummies. I told her straight from up that I had no idea what is going on because I had just bought the bag and didn't do anything to it.

The absolute second I finish my sentence the baby shoots liquid diarrhea out of it's ass like it was being paid to do it. I can't handle shit and some of it even got on my forearm so start to puke. Mid projectile vomit the teen comes out sweating bullets and I rush in their. I sit on the toilet and enter orbit when my ass opened. I swear I lifted off the Fucking seat while simultaneously blowing chunks in the piss station to the right of the toilet. 

Once I'm done throwing up I can hear the complete chaos unfolding outside the door. The toddler is hysterical the mom I'd shouting and the stewardess is trying to calm everyone down. I clean up as much as I could and step out of the bathroom and as soon as I did the most putrid smell hit my nose. I assess the damage done by the hershy squirting baby and it was a lot worse than I thought. Not only did the baby manage to shit out of it's onesie and onto my forearm, but also all over the seats in the first row. (Thank god no one was sitting there) as I make my way back to my seat not wanting to look the shit covered mother in the face I notice the baby also left a trail of turds all along the isle leading to her seat. 

I got back to my seat and everyone is looking at me like I opened fire on a bag of newborn puppies. I apologized more than I have ever in my life. And explained that I didn't know that gummy bears could do that. 

The plane made an emergency landing and everyone got off the plane because the smell was too much. I went to the airport bathroom to freshen up and once I got back I look at the plane I had just gotten off and they literally had guys in hazmat suits going in with cleaning supplies. I have never been more ashamed in my entire life and I'm literally shaking right now.

TLDR: I shared sugar less gummy bears on my plane. Little did I know they are laxatives and me and three others shit like out lives depend on it and create a huge mess.


Edit 1: I've been talking to police getting this figured out. The mom thought I had put something in them to make us react. I'm telling them the story and how sugar less candy can act as laxatives. TIl

I will edit/update later"
2ukkc5,non_TBI,"Today I wore pants, which is not unlike any other day in my life. However, today I wore these new dark jeggings (don't judge me) I had recently purchased. I checked myself out in the mirror, then headed to class. Little did I know the horrors awaiting me.

In the middle of class, my legs started to kind of feel tingly and my feet were numb. I looked down and noticed my feet were a purplish color, kind of like dead-flesh. This was not surprising to me because I have Raynaud's Disease- which means that sometimes my extremities don't get enough blood/oxygen so they turn funny colors and go numb. I'd seen this several times before, had the doctors check it out and they said I was good so why worry about it now?

I didn't think much about it until I got home and I realized my feet were *still* numb, even after three hours! Normally it goes away very fast. I touched my legs and realized they felt cold to the touch. This was when I took my pants off and discovered that both of my legs were purple. I'm talking person-who-was-been-dead-a-long-time-purple. Straight up cadaver-purple. Like, the kind of purple that makes you instantly concerned-purple. 

I immediately freaked out and began slapping my legs like an idiot, making this god awful squaking sound, trying to determine if there was any feeling there. I couldn't really tell because they were a little numb. I started doing squats and moving around- no change in coloration. I began running scolding hot water over them, thinking somewhere in my brain that the hot water would help the blood return to the surface of my skin and change the color.

At this point I was 100% convinced that I was going to lose both of my legs and have to use a wheelchair the rest of my life. After the last two months of binge-watching House, I was sure this had to be like some crazy cancer or weird disorder and that my legs were going to be dysfunctional due to lack of oxygen or blood or whatever it was. I started to cry and was thinking about how to get help, and whether or not I should call my mom. How would I even explain to my family that I was going to be crippled for the rest of my life? I started having a full-blown panic attack, wheezing and crying and freaking out like a rabid baboon. 

I looked back down to realize that the bath water was now a light shade of purple and my legs were less so. I blinked a few times, then I scrubbed my skin roughly and more purple came off. After much vigorous scrubbing and water, the majority of the purple washed away. My new jeggings, which I had not washed yet, had dyed my skin while I was wearing them- nothing more. The fact that they had been cold and numb was just related to the Raynauds but wasn't serious. And I felt like an idiot.

**TL;DR But you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan**


Edit: I didn't expect this to get any real attention, so thank you to everyone who shared in my shame! It's comforting on some level to know that many other people had similar experiences. Shout out to all the Raynaud's peeps- you the real MVP. And to the people who complained about the TL;DR.. Do you know what it's like not to be able to use your legs? But seriously, go watch Forrest Gump and enjoy the day. 

Edit's Edit: Thank you to the person who gave me gold! "
38sivk,non_TBI,"I'm doing this from my phone, so forgive me.

So last night my girlfriend said she's going to sneak me into her basement so we could cuddle and watch a movie. I had no plans to sleep over but as the night went along we both got sleepy and I figured why not. She brought me a blanket and pillow and we snuggled on the couch until she left me to go sleep in her room a little later. 

A little context: she's Chinese. She left to go sleep in her room so that when her parents wake up, they would find her in her room. She also said ""no one comes to the basement so you'll be fine.""

Well, about an hour ago I was startled by lots of movement upstairs. My ears were glued to the sound of steps walking all over the house. Suddenly, one heads downstairs. Luckily the couch is facing away from the entrance so I hid under the sheets and waited while someone, I think her dad, turned off the AC and continued to do some other stuff. I swear my stomach started to make small noises just to spite me.

After he went back upstairs, I ran into this closet and just waited, until I realized I really needed to take a shit. Assuming her dad coming downstairs was a one-time thing and wasn't going to happen again, I ran to the nearby bathroom and kept the lights off while I silently pooped.

Thump thump thump... Good God, the sounds of steps came again. ""But they wouldn't be coming to the basement bathroom would they?"" Boy was I wrong. Her dad tried to open the bathroom and when he couldn't, he went away for a second and came back with a key (I think). I grab onto the knob and hold the lock down while he pushes from the front. Looking back from 20 minutes into the future, this is kind of funny, but at that moment my mind was racing with all the potential situations as to his reaction to finding a brown man sitting on his toilet. Granted, he knows what I look like... But still. 

Luckily, her dad gave up and went upstairs. In this time, I decided, fuck it, and ran to the closet after flushing. I didn't wipe and holy shit was that a good idea. He came back almost immediately. I'm sure he was stupefied as to why the bathroom smelled like shit and how the door was open. Now I'm in the closet. Thank fuck my shit was solid.

So here I am guys. I'm in the closet right now with a poopy ass. Her dad is watching TV on the treadmill here. He probably noticed the blanket and pillow but I kind of thought ahead last and kind of left my shoes in a hidden corner. Hopefully he won't see them because technically he could if he looked properly.

I tried messaging and calling my gf but she's passed out and her phone is dead I think. 

Also I read a similar tifu a while back where people suggested ordering pizza to act as an escape but i don't know if that'll work because her mom and brother could still be upstairs. She said they should all be gone by 11 though. That's... Two hours.

The funny part is I'm 23 and she 21 and this is a very high school thing to do. Okay, that's not that funny. There's just a lot of cobwebs here and I don't like spiders.

Help me, Reddit. Keep me company in the hour of my doom. #saveourguy

Tl;Dr: snuck into girlfriend's basement and slept over, now smelling like poop and hiding in the closet from her dad, who used to be in a Chinese gang.

Edit: Just so you guys know, I'm not black, I'm Indian.

Update #1: TV is off and I think he went upstairs. I'm still staying here. I promise you I've learned from my mistakes.

Update #2: Girlfriend is awake. Coordinating rescue mission.

Update #3: She's scoping the situation upstairs and is going to come down in a bit.

Update #4: She hasn't come down yet but I hear voices upstairs and I feel like he's asking her about why there might be a pillow and blanket downstairs...

UPDATE #5: VICTORY IS MINE, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. He left to go to work and I am now enjoying a welcome coffee from my lovely girlfriend.

UPDATE #6: I didn't think a 6th update was necessary... But guys... Obviously I wiped before drinking coffee.

3xk5v5,non_TBI,"So we saw Star Wars with a couple friends this evening, and went out for some drinks afterwards.  While sipping our drinks, we discussed the movie and our reactions.  While doing so, our neighbor (who hasn't seen the movie yet) texts the wife asking how the movie was.

So my wife writes a response text which is ""Excellent, <spoiler> <spoiler>"" where there is a massive spoiler inserted in the <>.  She shows us what she's writing on her phone, we laugh and say, ""Don't send."" thinking she is joking.

She sends.

It gets kind of quiet, and I very calmly tell her that was a dick move, in front of everyone.  The neighbor instantly responds with some very PC sad texts.  Like ""Major bummer did you really just tell me the truth? :(((((((((""

She tries to laugh it off, our friends kind of laugh it off.  Then the texts keep coming.  This is our neighbor who feeds our pet for us while we're out on vacation, so we know her pretty well.  Wife shows another text, worse than bummer one, and tries to laugh it off again.  I again say it was really a dick move and we should probably just apologize tomorrow, again in front of everyone, and she unhinges.  She explodes about how she doesn't care, tells me to get a cab ride home, and leaves me there.

Our friends kind of do the awkward 'sip of the drink', and I strike up a conversation about something unrelated to move it on.  I hang out with the friends for another hour or so, one gives me a ride home, and that's that.

Except it isn't.  

I get home, see the wife is asleep, and then go outside to apologize to the neighbor.  When my neighbor answers her door, she is obviously sad, and when I apologize for the text she starts tearing up and making excuses for my wife.  I say sure, it may be true the wife is not a die-hard Star Wars fan and may not understand these things, but she shouldn't ruin the movie for you, and gave several good not-spoiler reasons to still see the movie.

I get back into our place, and the wife is up, because obviously she wasn't sleeping.  We argue and we fight, mostly because ""I embarrassed her in front of people by saying it was a dick move"".  Normally to keep a balance I will concede on some of these things, but I stuck to my guns that she should apologize to our neighbor the next day.  The wife doesn't want to, plays the victim card about how we already bought our neighbor a christmas present, and it gets pretty ugly from there on out.  Divorce is threatened, lots of back and forth, and I'm on the couch, writing this.

TL;DR: 

I fucked up by saying it's a dick move to spoil Star Wars, in front of our friends.

**Edit:**  Thanks for listening to my rant.  No, we're not getting divorced, and yes some of you are right in assuming that there are some social problems where she was not treated well growing up, but she's getting better and is worth the trouble.   

We sorted it out and ended up buying reserved-seating tickets for the neighbor and her BF the next day to make up for it."
37l04y,non_TBI,"One of my cousins lost her left middle finger in an accident a few years ago. 

The other day, she posted a photo on Facebook of her **right** hand nails after she'd have them painted. In my quasi-drunken state, I decided to leave a humorous comment. The next morning, I checked my phone, to see numerous angry comments. Confused, and unable to remember what I'd written, I went to the photo.

Turns out that I'd written ""Do you get a 10% discount?""

Next time I meet with her should be... fun.

I posted proof in the comments earlier on, but I think it's been buried. [Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/j4iRORf.png)
_____________________________________________________

The ""How to count"" Edit: A lot of people seem to be confused as to why a 10% discount is necessary and not a 20% off.

To clarify, most people get both hands worth of nails done at once. You have 10 fingers. 10% of 10 is 1. 10-1 is 9- the number of nails that she needs done.

3psb2q,non_TBI,"Here’s a little background on me. I'm a 27 year old who is white and gay. I'm not what you would call a stereotypical gay. I'm not flamboyant, I don't have a lisp, and I have horrible fashion sense. Despite this being 2015 and it not being a stigma to be gay where I live, I have still not come out at work. I'm also a natural flirt. It's not sexual; it's just my default setting.

I work in a pretty small office setting. It's just me, my boss, and five ladies. I have a great relationship with everyone in the office especially a girl named Vee. Everyone calls us the ""office couple."" Vee is a beautiful black woman and if I wasn't 100% batting for the other team, I would probably be all over that grand slam style. I keep my office life and personal life separate. I'll go out for after work drinks with the girls, but really nothing further than that. I have a wonderful boyfriend but he has never stepped one foot into my office building or met any coworkers. 

Yesterday at lunch, a couple of the girls came up to me and asked if I would ask Vee out. They spent all lunch trying to convince me saying things like...""she's single"" and ""you two are such fun and so cute together"" and ""she told us she likes you."" You know, the basic high school BS you hope to escape in the adult world only to realize that nobody changes.

Trying to escape this horrible ambush I said something that would snowball into my biggest regret:

""I'm just not into people like her.""

Now I know what you are thinking, and trust me I've thought about it constantly over the past 12 hours. Why did I say the word 'people'? I could have just said I'm just not into *her*, no need for the people part. I'm an idiot and I fucked up that's why. I thought I was being clever and putting water on the fire without admitting my gayness. 

**NOPE.**

""What do you mean you're not into *PEOPLE* like her?""

""She's just not my type, ok?""

""No, not OK, you said PEOPLE like her. What do you mean? Is it because she's black?""

""What?!? Of course not. I have no problem with Vee being black.""

""Then what is it? Why are you being such an asshole?""

""It's just...just...I'm gay.""

""DON'T PULL THAT GAY SHIT ON ME! YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF THIS. You're always flirting with everyone, we know you're not gay.""

I ran out of the lunchroom. Went to my office and shut the door. I stealthily left at the end of the day without anyone seeing me. 

It's the next day now and everyone is giving me dirty looks. Now despite actually being gay, and attempting an actual ""come out"" at work no one will believe me. Vee hasn't said a single word to me.

**TL;DR: No one believes I'm gay, so that makes me a racist.**

3zb0db,non_TBI,"This happened years ago when I was in college, and still haunts me to this day.

I had been casually dating a girl for a few months, not being careful enough, and she became pregnant. She decided she was going to keep the baby. We were both terrified because we were still in college, not committed, and not at all ready for that.

A few days after taking multiple pregnancy tests, we were having sex and something just didn't feel right. The texture was different, kind of like anal, but...sticky, and chunky. I pulled out and looked down and saw this bloody substance all over my junk, my stomach, and the bed.

Neither of us had any idea what it was, and didn't think much of it, assuming it was period remnants or something. 

A few days later she went to the doctor to get a checkup on the pregnancy. When she came back and told me the news, it was then that I realized that the substance covering my body, and her sheets, was my miscarried child."
359svf,non_TBI,"This whole sequence of events took place in less than 10 seconds. Reflexes, fuck you.

There's a short, but in this case crucial moment, between wiping your ass and dropping the paper in the toilet bowl.

As I was wiping my ass, I sneezed. A slimy drop of snot landed on my upper lip and instinctively I put the paper I was holding, on my nose to wipe it off. My body's way of saying ""WTF bro, you put shit on your nose"" was instant puking, which landed on my hands and in my lap. Now, I'm standing up, screaming out my disgust, with pants around my ankles, shit on my face and puke all over. Wife comes banging on the door, wondering what's wrong. My instant thought is ""she must never know"". In my stress, I reach for the door to ensure it's locked, so that she can't make any rescue attempts. Of course I trip, fall face first on the door. This doesn't calm my wife, but leaves vomit all over the door and a hurting nose, which I instinctively grab to acknowledge the pain. It's all a mess, like taken from a xxx-rated version of [Faulty Towers](https://youtu.be/yfl6Lu3xQW0)

Been spending the last half hour showering, cleaning the bathroom and making up half ass explanations to my wife.

I still smell the shit in my nose.

3ws24e,non_TBI,"This happened a bit ago.  I've wanted to put some distance from the event, because you never know who's a Redditor out there.

The company I worked for was an advertising company.  So needless to say, their website consisted of posting all of their work.  About a hundred or so video files.  And it was my job to convert them and put them up on the website.

Here's where it gets a little tricky.  The website was hosted via a server that we also used to send out clients works-in-progress.  Problem is, I was new and didn't know that.  I assumed the website linked back to some other server, not the server we regularly deleted media off of (via FTP).

In case you don't see where this is going, I had to free up space on the server via an FTP.  So I selected a bunch of files and hit delete.  Then I see it.  A folder marked WEBSITE.  And then it was gone.

My pulse starts to race; I can feel the color drain from my face.  I go to the website and start clicking around.  It's ALL GONE.  Every file.  Just a QuickTime symbol with a line through it.

Even worse, I found out we didn't have back-ups for ANY OF IT, and this was work going back to when the company started 10 years ago. 

When I say back-ups, I mean the converted files.  The files needed to be a certain size, codec, etc to play on the website.  I couldn't just put them up there raw.  Also, they were scattered around in the archives.  ALSO, they each had specific HTML code that linked them to the site that I didn't know.

Long story short, I spent the next week covertly converting and resorting the entire website.  No one ever found out, but there was a very close call when the owner of the company brought up the site in a meeting with a client.  Luckily he clicked on one of the only files I managed to restore at that point.  I spent that entire week horribly anxious, not sleeping well.

TL;DR: Didn't know our company was hosting their site off a server we used via FTP to send clients materials. Deleted the content, and spent the entire week fixing it.

Edit for clarification:  I knew that the video files were on the server, but I was only told to put them there to send to the web designer.  I had absolutely no idea he was hosting off our server (meaning ALL of the video files on the website linked back solely to the FTP), which made little to no sense to me.  Therefore, I didn't think anything of quickly deleting files off the FTP we normally deleted from.

Edit 2: We were not a web design company, so I don't know anything about web design.  I merely was tasked with creating/converting the files and sending them.  We outsourced the task of web design to a particularly inept individual.

***Edit 3:The website was set up by an outsourced web designer not affiliated with the company.  I don't know where the website itself ran from.  For the videos however,  they were instructed to put all of the video files into a single folder on a server via the FTP.  He linked directly to that folder for all the videos.  This was not my design, this was someone else's.***

**Edit 4: Ok, NOW I see why everyone's having a problem with this post.  You have to understand, we just called it ""The FTP"", meaning we were uploading to a server via an FTP (Transmit).  So when I say we threw it up ""on the FTP"" it means we used Transmit to upload the files to a folder on a server.  There.  That should clear things up.  Sorry for the massive confusion.**  (Fixed instances of this in the post)

Edit 5:  The video files for the website were in the same location as the places we put the videos we sent to clients.  They were in a separate folder, yes, but still in the same location.  We were always scrambling for server space, so we would have to delete things here to make room.  This particular day I was being hounded by my boss to make room very quickly.  So I just selected a bunch of items for delete, not knowing at all that the videos for our website were housed there as well until it was too late.  It was common practice to delete things from there, except nobody gave me the heads-up there was anything to avoid.  We only used the FTP to transmit files, so while I HAD transmitted website files before, I thought it was simply a transference, not that they were being hosted from that server as well.)"
2qahfq,non_TBI,"I'm home from college for winter break, and this fuck up starts November first, when I started growing the dirtiest, scraggliest beard for No-Shave-November and deciding to rock it as well as not cut my hair for a couple months...because why not? Basically I look [this fucking guy](http://i.imgur.com/Y1iGjq1.jpg). 

Well my mother was busy so she told me to go pick up my little brother from school. I hopped in the car and drove to his middle school, and pulled up in the line of cars where parents wait to pick up their kids. Apparently there's a new system because I didn't see a guy directing cars when to move and I accidentally cut off a school bus that was trying to get past. The guy came over and knocked on my window and said ""First time? We take turns here, sir. You have to wait for my signal."" 

So whatever, I stay in line and kids come out and their parents take them away. I didn't bring my phone because he usually comes out right away and I thought I'd be home in five minutes. Ten minutes pass. Where is this guy? Fifteen minutes. Dafuq is he doing? Twenty minutes. By this point I'm straight staring at the front door watching all these other kids come out. I can't even text my brother. Now the security guy from before seems to be watching me closely, and so are a few of the other teachers waiting inside to make sure all the kids make it home safely. And I'm staring back at them like don't hate me cuz I'm beardiful. 

Then it hits me...MY BROTHER DOESN'T GO TO THIS FUCKING SCHOOL ANYMORE.

He was in eighth grade last year and is now a freshman in high school. I'm at the wrong fucking school. So I just...pull away and leave.

From their point of view, a haggard, bearded guy they had never seen before, who was coming to pick up a kid ""for the first time,"" just waited in front of the school for half an hour, watched all the kids intently as they came out, had what must have been a frustrated look on his face, (I think I sighed a few times as I got more and more pissed at my brother being ""late"") and then JUST FUCKING LEFT.

TL;DR: I can never go back to that school again

Edit: Not that I would ever have to...

3pugel,non_TBI,"I was in class where I was randomly partnered up with a girl to do a group project. I have never said a word to this girl but she is a smoking hot 10/10. So we talked after class and decided to stay after school to work on the project to get it out of the way.

So, I arrived home late since I stayed at school and my girlfriend asked why I wasn't home at my normal time. (not in a paranoid type of way...but just curious about where I was). 

So I told her ""Oh I have a group project to do and her and I decided to stay after class and get it done""  

She jokingly responded, ""oh so she's your side ho now?""

I said ""No she's way out of my league""

She said ""then how are you dating me?""

I said ""because you're in my league""

3 hours later....the bedroom door is still locked and I want to go to bed.

UPDATE: She unlocked the door, called me a moron, threw a glass of water on me and I better do something special tomorrow night. We have been dating for 6 years and practically married."
44h3fw,non_TBI,"My brother is currently 7 and I told him this lie when he was 4. 

It all started when I saw a moth in my room and my brother comes in. He asked me what was it, and brilliant me thought: this is a perfect time to prank him. I start ""hyperventilating"" and told him to run out of the room. We run out of the room and I told him: That a moth! Moths are like vampires, they suck the blood of people and kill when people they are asleep. He gets scared like any 4 year old would and runs into his room. Each time he sees a moth, he literally run full speed yelling bloody murder to his room and locks the door. His favorite attire is turtlenecks because moths can't get the his neck.

 Fast forward to an hour ago.

My mom gets a call from school asking her if she can pick my brother up because he had a panic attack. Apparently today the schools science teacher brought a ton of butterflies to show kids how caterpillars turn to butterflies. When he saw them, he started running and screaming around the room telling everyone to save themselves because moths suck blood and kill people. The whole class started panicking and started running and screaming. 

I think it's time to tell him that moths don't suck blood or kill people...

Update: Due to popular demand, I won't tell my brother the truth. You sick bastards!"
3ivfbg,non_TBI,"For the past 6 months, my best friend has maintained an Excel doc on his laptop to keep track of every time he masturbated. He did this at the insistence of his girlfriend. 

When he confided this to me I couldn't believe it. But apparently 7 months prior she had caught him masturbating in his kitchen (which is weird I know) and got very angry and disturbed. She insisted that he keep a log of every time he masturbated. 

So for 6 months he's had an Excel doc listing every time he masturbates. It had the following columns: Date, Time, Location, What I Masturbated To (if online pornography, he had to include a hyperlink to the video), and Notes. 

So the other day my friend left his laptop open. He left, went out to get beer. I saw the Excel logo on the bottom of his screen and  I wondered if it was his legendary Masturbation Log. It was. I had to peek! 

Then I go the idea to prank him. I knew his girlfriend reviewed the log at the end of every week. So I scrolled up a bit to make some edits to his entries from a few days ago, to make it look like he masturbated to some weird ass shit. 

Here are a few of the entries I inserted: 

What I Masturbated To: Your friend Ashley's facebook album of her at that beach in Mexico. (Included a URL for the album.)
Notes: She's very sexy. I imagine her often when we make love. 

What I Masturbated To: Youtube video of a mouse caught in a glue trap. (Included url to vid) 
Notes: Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. 

What I Masturbated To: Imagined what it would be like to have sex with a pig in a factory farm. 
Notes: First time fantasizing about beastiality, I am into it. 

What I Masturbated To: (Just a link to a gay porn video, something with ""Cock"" in the title) 
Notes: Very nice. 

And a few more things like that. Saved the doc. 

So I thought it was a pretty funny prank. Well...turns out he never noticed the entries, she saw them, and she 100% thought that he entered them. Apparently she absolutely refused to believe somebody pranked him and she was completely disgusted. Crying and shouting, I hear. She thinks he's a complete pervo. 

She broke up with him. 

My friend is furious. But he has no idea it was me who did it. He constantly leaves his laptop open, he has a lot of people over, the entries were from earlier in the week. 

I don't think he suspects me. But he's really angry and also down in the dumps about it. His now ex-girlfriend told her friends about his ""sick fetishes"" and obviously the rumors are starting to spread. 

I want to admit it was a prank, but I won't. I feel so awful. 

I am thinking of sending an anonymous email to her telling her it was a prank, but not revealing my identity. 

TL;DR - TIFU by accidentally getting my best friends girlfriend to break up with him when I, as a prank, edited his ""masturbation log"" Excel doc that she forced him to maintain. "
2a78al,non_TBI,"This happened a good long while ago now so not really today...


It was April when I started this journey. During the winter I became a member of a magic mushroom forum and was learning all I could about growing magic mushrooms. I tried it once before and grew only a yellowish green mush that smelled of sweaty socks but this time would be different. I had a spore print sent to me and was off to the races.

 I had tried mushrooms once before about 10 years prior and the experience was rather enjoyable. I have had way too many bad experiences with LSD to ever think about trying it and from what I remembered the mushroom experience was much less chaotic and harsh for me than the majority of my acid trips had been. After following every tip I could gather and about a month and a half of waiting, I have viable mushrooms drying in the food dehydrator.

 The whole journey, from spore print to fruit, was done for reasons I don’t yet have a great grasp on. I was thinking at the time that growing them would impart some spiritual meaning into my experience. It had been a long, long time since I had taken any illegal substance and I wanted it to be special in some way. Growing them myself was an attempt at providing that, I guess. 
 The night I took them I really wasn’t planning on doing so. I was borde out of my wits and chatting with on-line friends. I told them I was going to eat my mushrooms but didn’t know how much to eat without a scale. I took a few pics of my intended dose and posted them and immediately got advice to cut that dose in half. So, with my wife asleep, I went down to the kitchen and made a concoction of purple slushy and powered mushrooms and gulped it down. I came back up and told the chatters that the deal was done and that I was taking shower and would be back once the fun started. 

 In the shower about 5 minutes when I felt a rush like I consciousness was being pulled away from my body. I was fighting to keep it with me. It felt as though is I had let it fly away I would have had a full out of body experience but for some reason I felt compelled hold on to it. I quickly turned off the water and looked down at my feet. They seemed miles away. That is when it hit me that the shrooms were kicking in!

 Out of the shower and I put on the same clothes I came in with and headed up stairs. The shower Is in the basement of the house and there is a door at the top of the stairs. Opening the door, the light from the kitchen blasted my eyes and I got a good gauge of how far along in the experience I was. I would see that the kitchen floor looked smooth and had a liquid like texture. But before I could survey any more my black cat ran down in the basement.

 I didn’t want to forget about him down there and it never really thought that I could just leave the door open and shoo any members of our herd that wandered down there after my trip. I trudged down the stairs after him and scooped him up and started back up the stairs. Half way up, a brown blur flew down the stairs as another cat dove to the basement. I tossed the black one in the kitchen and went after the brown one. While s picking up brown one, the black cat came back down the steps again and I scooped him up too. Now I am carrying 2 cats up the stairs.

 At the top of the stairs, the door is wide open and I see our other 3 cats had come to investigate the commotion. As I made the final push to the top they all jumped into action like they planned it in advance. I started laughing hysterically, let go of the cats in my arms and sat on the top step as I watched all the cats bounce down the stairs. I found the whole situation so funny. Here I am coming up hard on mushrooms. I can feel the confusion building every second and now I have to figure a way of getting all 5 cats out of the basement.

 By the time I had collected myself and devised a plan my face was hot and objects were starting to move. The time dilation had manifested and minutes were seeming to take longer and longer. My plan was to go down and capture one cat at a time and usher them up stairs. Once I got to five, the task would be complete. I raced down and grabbed the first cat I came across. And ran to the up to the landing and toss it, pretty forcefully, up the last 3 steps into the kitchen so it would get the point that I didn’t want them down there. Back down I went and did the same thing…that’s 2 down and 3 to go. I was getting more confused by the minute and on the fourth cat…..I had forgot how many cats I had previously ushered up the stairs. *face palm*

 On my way back down I decided to count the cats down stairs and that would let me know how many were upstairs. Unfortunately, the whole time I had neglected one key detail in my foolproof plan….The door was still open. Just as I reach the basement floor, the whole heard can stampeding down again. Plan A was an utter failure. 

Formulated just as quickly as Plan A, was Plan B. Cats have got names right? I will count the cats as I bring them up and remember the name of each cat so that I don’t lose track like the last time. BRILIANT!!! I thump back down the stairs and grab Funchee, the black one, and take him up stairs. He quickly tries to run back down and I push him back and close the door. Back down stairs I grab another cat. “Sammie…number 2”, I think as I put her up stairs and close the door behind me. 

 At this point my mind is worn out. Things are moving very well and walls have waves in them and on them. It is all but impossible to keep my mind on the task at hand. Those 2 things, coupled with the fact that the time dilation is making the last 5 minutes chasing these beasts feel like I have been at it for hours, is making this fool’s errand about as much as my brain could handle in its current state. I trudge on trying to complete this task and grab another cat but again at the top of the stairs I forgot where I was in the order. I put that cat up stairs and tried to count the cats up there to give me an idea of how many were left. But of course, they are not in the kitchen anymore. And again it escapes me that if I just keep bring up cats until I run out of cats to retrieve I will be through with this cluster fuck.

 Unable to think pass my current predicament, I race around up stairs looking for the cats that had been brought up and they are nowhere to be found. My state had grown worse and I start thinking that maybe they got outside. But there was no way they could get out because no one opened the……..DOOOOOOR!!!!!....... The DOOOOOOOR!!!!! I forgot the close the basement door. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!!!

 Ran back into the kitchen and down the stairs for the 50 quadrillionth time and BAM….there they were all 5 of them… Safe and sound. I had found the missing cats. Hallelujah!! They weren’t outside…my wife would have killed me if they were gone. Me, all high and shit and the cats go missing? I might as well pack my shit and go! What a relief! I love my kitties! *kiss * *kiss* *kiss*…..wait! Are we still in the basement?!?!?! FUCKING COCK SUCKING SON OF A BITCH MOTHER DAMN SHIT HELL……

I am done. My mental ability is gone. Each trip up and down felt like an eternity, I had only just enough energy left to get up stairs to the couch. I kneel by the couch and think about what I am going to do. I am mentally exhausted because apparently, counting to 5 is impossible while on mushrooms. My mind racing to come up with a solution to this impossible problem and never once did I think of just leaving them down there until they found something more entertaining to do than drive me out of my fucking mind.
 The white flag was up. It was over. I needed the big gun. It was 2 or 3am, and she had to get up and go to work in the morning but I had no choice...I needed an adult. I have to wake my wife. She would make it all better. She will tame those damn hellions and all will be fine......but it wasn’t fine.

 I went up stairs to our room and woke her in the gentlest way possible. By jumping on the bed and yelling “help!! I took mushrooms!!!5 cats in the basement and I can only count to 4.” Not the way I had envisioned it going down in my head but I was happy to get that much out without forgetting the reason I woke her up In the first place.
 Sleepily she marched down the stairs and I lead her to the kitchen where the basement door was still wide open. All I could do was stand at the door and point down the stairs. I think I may have whimpered a little too with my gesture. She was not amused! I thought I was finally going to get closure. She would get the cats from the basement and I would be saved but NOOOO…..my savior turn to tormentor as she said the only words in the word that could crush me into an even more pitiful state. “well…Go get ‘em” she said. She didn’t understand that I was fighting this fight for what seemed like days now and wanted nothing more than to curl up in the corner and cry until I fell asleep.

 She had no clue how close I was to a break down. Tears welled up as crossed the threshold of the basement door and descended again into my personal hell. I scooped up a kitty and carried it slowly up stairs setting it on the kitchen floor. One, my wife said in a long drawn out voice like she was talking to a 2 year old. Back down I went and grab up another “bundle of joy” and slinked up the stairs only to be shamed again by a long drawn out 2. By the third cat, short audible “poo, poo” sounds were coming from me as I was almost to the breaking point. My wife had begun to laugh at me and seemed to laugh harder each time I came up even more beaten than before. When the last cat came up I was greeted by a sighing “5” and a “now was that so hard” from my wife. I tried to apologize but she waved me off with a stern “we’ll talk about this in the morning” and walked up stairs to bed.

 The cat ordeal was over but the trip was far from it. I was immensely grateful to my online buddies who talked me into halfing the dose because the rest of the night was filled with confusion and mind fuckery and intense time dilation. Not really a bad trip as bad trips go, but not at all enjoyable. I think I can cross mushies off the list of viable boredom relievers. I won’t be doing them again anytime soon that is for sure.

TLDR: ate magic mushrooms for the first time in many years and chased cats out of the basement all night until I gave up and got my wife to tame the beasts.


UPDATE: Wow!—made the front page, got gold….today was a good day. Thank you for the gold whoever you are. I am at work and will get to the few questions when I get home.  The best part is seeing all the comments of people who can relate. 

Update 2: OK…first things first. I have 6 cats now and 2 large dogs. My wife is a vet tech and was coming home with a new animal every 6 months to a year. Every time a kitten’s mother got hit by a car, I got a sob story a new cat.  Now I think she hit her limit seeing that we have 2 litterboxes that hold 40lbs of litter each and she is cleaning them out twice a day. I told her that she was heading to “crazy cat lady” status and she stopped collecting them. But I really think that if I didn’t say something that I would be swimming in cats right now.  She has a problem…

Next, as to why I didn’t leave the cats down there…I was incapable of looking past the task at hand and hyper focused on getting the cats out of the basement because of the effects of the mushrooms. Under normal circumstances, I would have been able to get them up there just by shaking their treats or chasing them with the spray bottle or just left them down there with the door open. Unfortunately, I couldn’t even consider any other options. That was my job and it had to be done. The mushroom gods had spoken.

To people giving me advice on how to have a good trip...you make the mistake that most drug users do. You assume I am a novice at (insert drug here) and just need your guidance. Let me assure you, I my drug dick is bigger than most. The number of different substance I have taken is quite extensive. My LDS experiences are in the 50+ range. I have given the same advice to other people countless times. Sometimes, you just say fuck it…just eat that shit! Sometimes it’s good and sometimes it’s bad. For me the majority of my LSD experiences were tough to get through. So much so that the mere thought of taking it again gives me anxiety. I will not be taking it again…so feel free to eat my share along with your’s.  I wouldn’t say I am 100% done with shrooms. But given that their effects are similar to LSD…the stars would have to align so perfectly, that having another psilocybin experience was the only practical option in that moment. it will only be a once in a lifetime event.  So the chances are next to none that I will ever eat them again.

I have to say again it is good to see all the people telling of their own psychedelic experiences. The movement is still alive and growing every day. It may not be in our lifetimes, but someday people like us will be able to experience any substance they want without fear of imprisonment. I hope I am here to see that day, even if I am too old and frail to take the journey myself.

In high school one day I was waiting for my mom to pick me up because my car was in the shop, and while waiting I was really bored and picked up a leaf and was just fucking with it. At one point I rubbed it against a wall and some of the chlorophyll rubbed of and onto a the wall. I thought to my self ""oh that's cool, I'm gonna make a square"". A few seconds later, while I'm making my square the school cop runs up and grabs my arm and twists it behind my back and handcuffs me and throws me in his car, screaming at me while he does.

Luckily my mother was there to get me already and when the cop told her I was about to go to jail for rubbing a leaf against a wall, she demanded we see the principal first to tell her why that's stupid.

We told her the circumstances, and how I had no malicious intent, that it was just a guy being fascinated by something he learned at school 3 years ago, my principal said and I quote ""well you may know that was chlorophyll but some of our less academic minded students will see that and think they can write on walls, that's why we have to suspend you for writing graffiti""

TL:DR I thought science was cool and looked at chlorophyll, and got suspended because some kids don't pay attention in freshman biology."

Anyways, so earlier this morning I went to the gas station to buy beer for the upcoming week since it it going to be a hectic week I knew the only time I could go would be this morning.  I walk into the gas station and grab a case of beer and proceed to the counter.  I plop the beer on the counter and am asked for my ID.  Now before I continue I need to preface that I have terrible handwriting.  Like that of a second graders.  No idea why the elementary school decided I should pass but they did me wrong.  Anyways, so just remember I have terrible handwriting. I give the ID to her without fear and just wait for it back.  She takes a look at it and tells me to get out the store.  Confused I ask her what the big deal is and she tells me that my ID is obviously fake and that I need to get out now.  I have never ever had this problem before so I tell her that its not fake at all and she turns it around and points to my signature.  She says there is no way someone has that bad of writing except for someone trying to forge a signature since it obviously wasn't natural.  Without hesitation, me and all my brilliance decide to pull out my real ID to prove that hey its a really good fake ID and I just have really bad handwriting.  I point to the signature on my real and she just gives me that ""Oh my god I can't believe we let people like you breed"" look and starts to just laugh.  Needless to say I am having a dry week and living a life without any fakes from here on out.

312500,non_TBI,"Alright, so every year I prank my stepdad. It's become a point of contention in my household because he's a very angry person and my goal is always to make him angrier. I'm terrible I know. Year to year the pranks have gotten worse and worse, last year I glued the milk carton to the top shelf of the fridge and he pulled the carton and the shelf along with it, ripping the carton and milk/other wet goods went flying all over the floor/stepdad. I'm glad I wasn't in the house for it.

Anyways, this year I decided I'd be a good stepson and do something nice for him, but only at the cost of doing something extremely mean first. 

The Setup: I backed up his laptop to an external hard drive. He's not the most tech savvy so he won't really notice any of the fuckery I'm about to perform on said laptop. I then installed that old ass bonzi buddy virus on his laptop. Afterwards, I took a firecracker, peeled it open and emptied the contents on some rolling paper and flattened it out after sealing it with the quick fuse that holds firecrackers together. I pried up his enter key and glued it to the bottom of the key. I let the fuse just barely stick out from under it so I could reach it. This was all done the night before.

The Action: I came over my parents house early in the morning saying I needed to print a report and that I'd use his laptop because it was easier. I opened it up, hiding the fuse with my thumb and called him over. 
""What the hell is that?!"" He said pointing at the dumbass looking purple monkey. I told him it was a virus that certain fake porn sites can give you and he got all super defensive saying that he doesn't watch porn. Not sure if he does, don't care enough to know. I told him I could fix it and that he should go make some coffee. So I walked with him in the kitchen and had the screen block his view of my hands.
As I pulled my lighter out of my pocket I just said, ""Ah I think I go- OH SHIT"" and boom, his keyboard literally exploded. Keys went flying and I ducked. I hadn't expected it to be as big of a pop as it was. I must've laid out the powder wrong or something. Or maybe the glue ignited? I have no clue. 

He dropped to his knees and was holding his head, talking about taxes and other important documents I had just ruined. His shock quickly became anger as he pushed me away and saw his now dead laptop. I ran out of the room into the garage, and honestly I was giggling like a little kid. I couldn't help it. He stormed after me and found me in there at the table he usually drinks at, with a brand new laptop I got him as a belated birthday gift. 

I've never seen him go from being so angry to confused to extremely happy. It's usually the other way around. Anyways that was my eventful morning.

TLDR: I'm a jerk and prank my stepdad too much. Did a great prank with a surprise gift at the end. He hates me less.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold! You guys rule!"
3vycz8,non_TBI,"I am a 21 year old guy. Today I was returning home from a dinner party when along the way I met this girl on the bus.

Before moving ahead, let me bring to light the fact that she is very good looking (drop dead gorgeous if I may say so). 

So we were standing on the bus, due to the lack of empty seats and she was right behind me. For some reason, the driver braked hard and we were all pushed ahead. The girl almost fell on me and I picked  her up and asked her if she was okay. She smiled and replied that she was and we got talking about stuff. She was a student and so was I and we both talked a bit about studies and all. We flirted a bit and hit it off; and also exchanged numbers. I was happy about being so lucky... 

After a great time I arrived at my stop and bid adieu to her and said I will keep in touch. She smiled and waved me goodbye and I got down. 

I started walking home from the stop, feeling lucky about having met this absolute stunner of a woman... Then out of habit I checked my back pocket.

My wallet was gone. 

(For those wondering, I tried the number and it was a hoax..)"
2t0aon,non_TBI,"So her pictures were pretty, she seemed normal. I hadn't done the Tinder thing before so I didn't know what to expect, but when she invited me over to her place I figured I'd scored pretty hard. I  showered, groomed, and drove the 20-30 minutes to her address. I'm not even worried about safety,  she's just a small girl right? I'll be fine. My concern at this point is whether I'll measure up.  

I get there and I'm wondering if I have the right place. It's completely overgrown. The grass hasn't been cut in 7000 years. The walls needed a fresh coat of paint a decade ago. Are...are the windows boarded up? I check the letterbox for the house number and check the message again - yep, this seems to be the right place. I guess it's just a crappy old house.

I knock and after about a minute she comes to the door. Unpleasant surprise no.1: she looks 15 years older than in her pictures and haggard; like she hasn't slept in a week haggard. I don't know what the fuck she's wearing but it looks like a vague attempt at sexy. Like, I bought this leopard print dress at walmart 15 years ago sexy. 

I'm already thinking about how to get out of this as she invites me inside. It's even worse in here. The paint is peeling everywhere, it's dark and messy. It smells quite unpleasant. She invites me into her room, which is lit up like a cheap brothel. 

She sits down on her bed and asks if I mind if she smokes. Smoking in your house? That's a bit gross, but it's not really a surprise at this point. I say sure. 

And that's when she pulls the meth pipe out of her bag. 

It all clicks. The garden, the paint, the boarded up windows, the smell, her appearance. This is a crack den and she is a crack whore. 

Now I'm afraid. What is this house? Are we alone? Are 4 gangbangers going to jump out of the other room and mug me?

So I nope'd out of there as fast as you can say ""oh holy fuck nope"", making some vague excuse about getting cold feet. She wasn't really bothered; she was higher than the empire state by this point and rolling around on her bed. 

I drove home feeling dirty and showered again. And that was the story of my first ever tinder date. 

**TL;DR: went for a booty call, ended up in a crack den.**

**P.S. Fucking Jenny.**"

[Update can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/41umb6/tifu_by_telling_my_terminally_ill_friend_that_i/)

Holy fuck, reddit, this might be my biggest fuck up of all time... There's this girl I'm friends with that I've known for maybe 8 months or so who I've grown really close to.


 The thing is though that I live in Sweden and she lives in America so our communication is limited to snapchat and kik (don't judge, we're 15) so emotions are hard to recognize through text. 


Now ever since we started talking she would many times mention that she was going to the oncologist and having a session. Now for those of you who don't know; an oncologist is basically a cancer doctor, but since I'm not a native speaker I mixedthis word up with orthodontist. This was supported by the fact that she had braces.


There were several hints that proved that an oncologist wasn't infact a dentist. She once said she had cancer but I assumed she was joking because we had joked about dieseases before this. She brought up the cost of her medical visits to the oncologist as extremely much.Like several hundred thousand much, but I knew health care in america was expensive as shit so I just assumed that this girl went to a reaaaaalllyyyy expensive dentist (her parents are **loaded**). Ofcourse a normal person would realize she had cancer, but me? Nah, I'm retarded. 


Fast forward to 3 hours ago.


We had been talking for a bit and she sent me a picture of her smiling (with braces) telling me she was at the oncologist/doctor and that she'd be back in 2,5 hours. I told her good luck and watched a movie until she texted me ""I only have 5 months left."" I assumed she meant that her braces were coming off and I said ""Congratulations, finally! :D"" This is ofcourse bad enough but the fuck up doesn't end there... ""..."" She said and me thinking it was a joke about her dying said ""r.i.p, [girl]. I bet you will go to hellxD"" (bad joke regardless) she just said ""fuck you, [lgoku], I thought you were my friend..."" Then she blocked me. Me not realizing what just happened was kinda laughing to myself thinking she was pretending to be angry (we often did this). My friend asked what was funny so I showed him the convo and he just looked at me like I had killed someone. 

""Dude... You realize an oncologist is a cancer doctor, right?"" That's when I realized I had fucked up.

TL;DR Told a terminally ill girl that she would go to hell.

3s6fqt,non_TBI,"So this story of mine happened about a year ago, and I don't think I will ever forget what happened that day.

I used to work at this certain coffee corporation, ya know, the one that pretty much rules over the world. My store had this regular customer that would come in every single day, and there was always something to yell at us about. Her coffee was burnt, the tables are gross, it's too loud, we're all out to get her, etc. She was really OCD and freaked out if you so much as got a splash of water on the side of her cup. After about two years of dealing with this woman, biting my tongue and trying my best to give her the best ""experience"" she can get (even harder since I was a supervisor), one day I just snapped.

I saw her in line and immediately braced myself for impact. I tried to do everything for her the way she wants it, and of course it backfired. She usually liked to put her lids on herself, so instead of snapping it on, I just set it on top and informed her of what I did. She asked me why I did that and I told her that I'm just trying to be convenient to her. This bitch just started **yelling** at me, telling me I'm trying to burn her on purpose and get her sent to the hospital, and how she's going to complain to corporate as she always does.

I literally lost it at her ungrateful attitude. She said ""How about you just get someone else to take care of me?!"" Here's my fuck up, I responded with ""How about you stop being such a *fucking bitch*?!?!"" Instantly my store got quiet, and at this point I'm on a fucking roll so I'm just yelling at this customer, venting all of my two years of pent up aggression. My other supervisor had to drag me off the floor to calm down, and I just turned the keys over and left. Several customers actually clapped for me when I was on my way out, saying they were proud of me for sticking up for myself. I'm just like ""yay, there goes my fucking job"", even though I felt amazing about it. I called my boss and told him what happened, his only response was ""oh boy..."", as this kind of thing was inevitable.

In the end, I got a write-up and didn't lose my job, even though she was doing her damn hardest to get both me and my boss fired. This lady has a track record in our entire district of being a cunt, and this final issue was enough to get her banned from every store in our district. I fucked up big time, but amazing things came out of it. Moral of the story, don't take anyone's shit.

TL;DR: Cursed out a customer, almost got fired, ended up getting her banned from our district.

Edit: Wow, you guys are awesome. First big post and I made the front page! I got gilded too which is wicked sweet. It's been a bit of a hectic day for me, so this cheers me up a lot. I'll get to responding to some of you guys later tonight when I get home!

Edit2: For one, this incident isn't fake. It actually happened. And for those of you who are saying it's not a fuck up, it is. Fuck ups don't always have to end in some horrible manner. I made a terrible decision out of anger, and really should have gotten fired. I put myself and my boss in a tough spot, and while it felt rewarding, it also hit my pride that I allowed this woman to get under my skin like that. So no, I ""won"" that fight, but only because of the mercy of the gods."
458p1a,non_TBI,"I work in the IT branch of a large company wich manages 4 hospitals and a lot of smaller clinics. The CEO clicked on a mail containing the new ransomware called Teslalocker v3 and his PC immediatly came to our offices. Luckily we have great relationship between co-workers. And so we are joking about the dickhead of our CEO who managed to get this virus with a .zip file. With a live hiren's boot cd we discovered that luckily only the files in the shared folders were encrypted leaving a lot of file untouched. So we decided to clone this hard disk on another one, format the original disk to reinstall Windows and copy back the good files. So now i'm in front of [Norton Ghost 32](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__VCmX9dWoco/RlnjUPsSOKI/AAAAAAAAAB4/dX7Bv0b1UNc/s1600-h/Ghost_select.jpg) with the 2 disks connected and had to decide wich disk to use as source and wich to use as destination. You probably guess where this is going. I had no other relevant information but the brand of the 2 disks and my still-laughing brain inverted them. Time warp 20 minutes the clone is done and I boot the original disk before formatting it to save the files and the PC configurations. On the Windows logo screen i immediately start jerking to why the PC of the CEO was still XP and had a very strange PC and Login names. In a split second the realization kicks in: I copied inverting the disks and completely lost the PC configurations and the good files. I immediately go to report to my boss who had to call the CEO and fake that all the file were lost with the virus to cover me.

TL;DR my boss will never trust me again because idiot me erased CEO hard disk."
3w7w5s,non_TBI,"So this actually happened a few months ago, when I started my new job.

So I'm an intern at a small web-development company. I'm here to write code but because there's not a lot of work going I frequently leave the building to go for smoke breaks. The building we're in has a couple of other companies in it. Some of the other people are really nice but some see others as competition and treat people accordingly.

So first week, I hold open a door for a woman who works on the floor below us. She tells me that it's offensive for someone to hold hold the door open because shes a woman, I just leave it and tell her I'd do it for anyone, she's pretty pissed so I took the stairs instead of taking the elevator with her. 
Here the TIFU really begins.
So a few weeks later, I'm coming in from a smoke break I was on my phone, trying to get my auto correct to work. I walk through the door and see someone coming towards the door so as I always do, I hold it open. Now this morning I was particularly annoyed, tired and stressed. I peek up from my phone to look at who's coming and it's her, Mrs Door Assault. So I simply let the door go and get into the elevator. She mustn't have been looking as she got to the door because she walks straight into it, this big ass fire door. She breaks her nose and falls backwards, just as the elevator door closes. I saw her hit the door and fall backwards because fire doors close slowly to avoid slamming. According to my boss she was bleeding pretty bad. I feel like a total ass for the whole thing but everyone I work with thinks it's pretty funny. I tried apologizing to her a few days ago in the staff room and she ignored me completely. Still feel very bad and I no longer take my smoke breaks for fear of injuring someone. 

TL;DR: Broke someones nose because they didn't like having doors opened for them."
3zerya,non_TBI,"I live in Kyrgyzstan. Here, two languages (Kyrgyz and Russian) are spoken simultaneously by locals and often mixed together. The word for 'ice rink' in Russian is ""KAtok"" while the word in Kyrgyz for 'penis' is ""KOtok"". Today was my day off and I wanted to go ice skating. When trying to find out details about the local skating rink, I forgot the Kyrgyz word for ice rink and tried to use the Russian one instead and I asked an old women in a store: ""Men bir saatka tsenterdagy chon kotokko kirip konki tepsem, kanchadan bolot?"" which translates to: ""How much will it be to go on the big penis downtown for an hour?"".

I am no longer allowed in the store."

3krsnw,non_TBI,"I like to lift weights before I go to work, and since I'm an early bird I'm usually at the gym around 4 or 4:30. It's a smaller 24/7 gym with card access and I'm usually the only one there that early. I enjoy being alone, because I like to dance and enjoy my music (but obviously wouldn't if others were around). I've danced countless times in the morning in between sets, but I realized yesterday (sorry, meant to post yesterday!) I have been fucking up for a while.

Rather than going to the gym in the morning yesterday, I went after work. Staff was actually there (normally it is to early and staff isn't around) and the girl at the desk looked at me and started whispering to her coworker. I shrugged it off and got into my workout. 

As I was leaving, both girls stopped me and said, ""Hey, can we talk to you for a second?"" I was not sure why they needed to talk to me and I'm pretty shy but reluctantly agreed. Once they pulled me aside one of the girls said, ""So do you always dance when nobody is watching?"" I was literally frozen. How? How could they know? Before I could even respond she said, ""We noticed a couple months back when checking camera footage that you come in and dance in the mornings during your workout. It is hilarious!"" I could barley utter a response, which mostly sounded like, ""Haha, yeah, I didn't even think about the cameras.""

Tl;dr - I go to the gym early when nobody is around. I get into my music and dance because nobody is there. Realized yesterday for the past couple months the staff has been unashamedly watching my ""performances."" Might have to switch gyms because of embarrassment.

Edit: Wow, I appreciate all the comments everyone. A little more background might clarify why I feel this is a fuck up. I am not a confident guy. Part of the reason I go to the gym early is because I don't have a huge audience. I got comfortable having no audience and let loose more than I would normally. While I was flattered many in the comments interpreted the girls reaction as flirting, it was and still is very uncomfortable to me. I hope I don't sound like a bitch. I have laughed at the irony of the situation, but I'm very anxious about returning during the day. Also...this isn't fake, I'm a 21 year old male, the dancing was not good and included classics such as the lawn mower, pelvic thrusting, and the running man."

419rqi,non_TBI,"Okay it seems that I must post that this wasn't today but like 18 years ago in HS.

I was set up on a blind date by a buddy of mine. I was the quiet but funny and nerdy kid who was essentially the king of the band geeks. She was a conservative and quiet girl about my age from the rich part of town. 

We talked on the phone for a few days (as was the style at the time) and I worked up the gumption to ask her out on a date-date. 

She said yes. 

I picked her up, and after some basic pleasantries with her mother, we drove off in my car. 

""Where are we going?"" She asked.

WELL SHIT. I hadn't actually connected the idea that I needed to plan. Normally I just wing it. So... I winged it....

""Where nobody can hear you scream"" I replied. 

I chuckled and kept driving, thinking that she got my ""joke"". A minute of awkward silence later and I asked ""Where would you like to go?""

""Home"" she said with the defeat in her voice that you'd expect from a 10 minute date-gone-wrong.

Shortest date ever."

2gc2ye,non_TBI,"So as the story goes, my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 5 years, but just moved in together about 6 months ago. She is very smart, clean, fun, and generally just an all-around good person to live with. Until about 5 months ago..

She typically wakes up earlier than me and hops in the shower right away, so by the time I get up she is finished in the bathroom. One morning as I was getting in the shower I noticed some brown... stuff near the drain of the tub. I thought nothing of it really, and made a note to clean the bathroom later that day as it had been a couple weeks.

The next day I hopped into a freshly cleansed bathtub and to my dismay, there again were traces of some brown material in different areas of the tub floor. Concerned and a little disgusted by this mysterious matter, I rinsed it away the best i could. It couldn't be what I thought it was, right? Maybe we had mice! Yes, mice. I should tell my girlfriend to pick up some traps on her way home.
Fast forward a few weeks; completely empty mouse traps, zero evidence of mousey activities, yet still almost every morning I was met with a greasy brown substance hastily mashed around the shower drain.

I planned my words carefully; it was not my intention to embarrass her, as I would expect this type of behavior would indicate some type of underlying mental disorder or strange fetish that I was somehow unaware of. Whatever her reason, we would work it out together and move on with our lives.

The moment finally came after dinner tonight. I took a deep breath, put my hand on her knee, looked her in the eye and asked, ""Laura, have you been pooping in the shower?"" A mix of confusion and mild amusement crossed her face and she responded with, ""Um, Excuse me? Is that a serious question?"" I guess my uncomfortable body language made her realize that I indeed was serious, and she immediately became alarmed. I explained the strange matter that I would find in the tub every morning, and it didn't look like residue from any of the products that she used, so I couldn't imagine what else it could be.

There was a pause before she began giggling hysterically. ""I use my morning coffee grounds as a face scrub!""
The amount of relief that washed over me was intense, but I was only able to enjoy it for a few seconds before she stood up and said, 

""Wait.. how long have you been suspicious exactly?""

""A couple weeks after moving in was the first time I noticed, why?""

**"".........YOU THOUGHT I WAS SHITTING IN THE SHOWER AND YOU WAITED 5 MONTHS TO CONFRONT ME ABOUT IT?!""**

Edit: to those of you saying I'm stupid for not being able to tell the difference between coffee and feces, you aren't understanding the *amount* that was in question. It was never a massive clump of grounds, but more like a half of a teaspoon of an oily residue. Maybe I am profoundly stupid.. but some of you are WAY too angry about it too :( buck up, kiddos! 

Edit 2: yikes. Some of these comments and angry PMs make me feel like I posted to youtube accidentally. Yeesh! "

3jo20a,non_TBI,"This happened yesterday.  So, I was lying on my bed in my room at home, reading, when I heard the front door open and my flatmate come in with a girl.  He clearly didn't think I was home, because they immediately went to his room (which shares a wall with mine). I was mildly amused by this, so I decided not to go out and ruin their fun.

Before long, they start getting down to it and, since they didn't think I was home, they weren't shy about being vocal.  He was grunting away, and she was moaning pretty loudly, shouting his name, etc.  All this noise started to turn me on, so I started masturbating, figuring that this was better than porn because it was real-life.  Eventually, the girl started moaning even louder, which I took to indicate that she was cumming, and there was some definite wall-banging as well, so it didn't take me long to finish either.  Satisfied, I went back to my book.

After about half an hour or so, I was bored of being confined to my room, so I went out into the lounge, not really caring if I'd embarrass them; we're all adults, we can just laugh it off.

I walked into the lounge to find my flatmate sitting on the couch, watching TV, with his arm around my little sister.

Christ. What have I done?

2ywgma,non_TBI,"I was in the kitchen reading the paper at the table, and my one year old was sitting in her high chair at the head of the table.

Except...that's not what actually happened. It did happen in my head...as I was dreaming it. What ACTUALLY happened was, my wife was happily sleeping next to me, while I was dreaming this, and was rudely awoken by the force of both my hands slamming into her skull.

The other night my boyfriend told me he wanted to try anal. I'm all for trying things for my man, but my butt has pretty much been a poop-only chute. It got me thinking about my butthole, and what it looks like (I know, that's weird). Freshly out of the shower, I laid down on my bed, spread my legs, and started looking around down there to see what it looks like for him. While I was doing this, I had to fart. My curiosity already piqued, I decided to watch myself fart. This wouldn't have been a problem, except last night I took a laxative to help persuade out 4 days of poop. I thought I'd gotten it all out of my system, but the geyser of molten shit that sprayed out of me indicated I was mistaken. For a stunned moment, I sat there with diarrhea all over my hand, my hand mirror, and my bed. The worst part is that my bed is completely bare right now because it is laundry day. Cheers.

42xn7a,non_TBI,"This actually happened about two weeks ago.  My sister recently died at the age of 32.  We were very close.  Her funeral was held at the Lutheran church she was married in.  Right before they started the service (after the viewing), I went to give my sister a kiss one last time.  When I went to stand up, I tripped over the altar they put out to kneel on.  Falling forward, I put my hands out to brace myself which happen to be on the inside of the casket, on the ledge next to the hinge of the lid.  It pushed the casket backwards. Luckily, no major harm was done.  The men put it back upright, fixed her hair, and placed her gifts next to her again. I swear if she were here, she would laugh so loudly.  My mom was so upset she was hysterical, and my step dad held back a chuckle. This is my life.

EDIT:  Wow!  Thank you all so much for your show of support.  It means a lot that you shared your experiences and laughs.  It was a funny moment for me, and I still get teased that I 'knocked 'em dead'.  Just FYI, she died of complications from Vasculitis.  In the end, her heart just wasn't strong enough to keep going.

So my Aunt and Uncle just had a baby boy a week ago. They also have two daughters, a 4 year old and a 2 year old (I'm a 26 year old guy, so my cousins are a lot younger than I am). Because they had their hands full, with the newborn and two young daughters, I volunteered to take my 4 year old cousin to the park for the day. She's very attached to me and love spending time with her. When I got to their house, she was eating so I just hung out at the house for a while. As she ate, my cousin told me about her new friend ""Mimi,"" and my aunt filled me in that Mimi was my cousin's new imaginary friend. I thought nothing of it, as many young children have imaginary friends. Enter the FU.
So I start to ask my cousin questions about Mimi. My cousin answers them with an adorable swiftness as if Mimi is a real person. She tells me all about her curly hair and how she wants to go visit Mimi at her house. I asked her where Mimi lives and she said that she'll show me on the way to the park. This is strange because, as a 4 year old, I didn't think she would actually be able to point out a location of where Mimi lives, let alone tell me it's ""on the way to the park.""
Anyway, so we head out a little while later, and as we're driving, my cousin starts telling me from her car seat ""Hereafter Superman, this is where Mimi lives."" I look to the right but there's nothing there. ""No the other side!!"" I look to my left and nearly crash as I realize she's pointing into a cemetery. ""Cousin, you've made a mistake, Mimi doesn't live here,"" I say, trying to laugh it off. ""Yes she does! She told me this is where she lives and sleeps!""
TL;DR Cousin may be interacting with a spirit. I will be crying myself to sleep tonight.

*EDIT: Well I have had quite a few people ask me to go to the cemetery to investigate. My initial reaction was: ya'll stupid. But the next day I'm off from work is Friday, so we'll see. Maybe then. *

EDIT 2: I've provided the name of the cemetery to a fellow redditor who said he/she will look up the graves and see if there is a Mimi. Let's be patient.

EDIT 3: A very caring redditor has looked up some info about the cemetery and came back with this: ""There is a single Mimi buried in that cemetery. She was 37 at the time of her death in 1949. That said, there are 16,800+ burials there so it's likely we could have a match on any name your niece gave you. Still, I'd also think there would be more than one Mimi. I'm happy to do more research on her, if you like."" So there is a Mimi! We will see. I will go back and talk to my cousin again.

Edit 4: just wanted to add that I've never had a post blow up and get this much attention before. This is so cool. Thanks reddit :D

EDIT 5: OK, so I'm going to see my cousin Friday and ask her a few more questions and maybe visit the cemetery. I just want you all to know that in reading all of your comments and they mean so much to me. Thank you for all of this attention, I had no idea this post would blow up like this. I wish I could respond to and thank you all individually but know that I'm trying my best to respond to as many people as I can. If I miss you, I really am sorry. Thanks again, Reddit, you've made my week :)

Edit 6: I think I need to clarify. I will be visiting the cemetery alone. I am NOT taking my 4 year old baby cousin to a cemetery. 

FRIDAY EDIT 1: Ok, everyone, I want to thank you all for being so patient with me and getting so invested in my post. This has literally made like my month lol I want you to know I will be posting an update today sometime, which will include details about my visit to the cemetery, info found by the wonderful u/gutterpeach about the Mimi buried in the cemetery, as well as any conversation I may have with my cousin. I am going to try my best to visit her and speak to her one on one and get some more insight, however I do ask of you to be a little more patient because today is in fact the most important holiday in my religion so I also have to visit other family members and I'm not sure what my aunt and uncle's plans are. But I will do my best to find some time to go visit them when I go to the cemetery. Again, thank you all so much for this opportunity. Lastly, just wanted to thank the splendid u/gutterpeach again for all her hard work in uncovering the enigma that is Mimi. For more of her amazing amazing work, I would definitely check out her sub, r/cemeterypreservation. Talk to you soon!!

3zxgu9,non_TBI,"This literally happened a few minutes ago, and I may be in need of searching for a new job, pls halp. I created a project at my work that allowed all of our products to be linked up to android apps that our customers can use to control them. Today was the day I was presenting this to upper management. Before starting my presentation, the CEO of my company stopped in and decided he was interested in my project. The presentation goes well, and is very well received. Everyone thinks its a great idea to link our products up to apps instead of controlling them via switches and push buttons. The final slide of my project was titled ""Why Android Initially"", this is where things went, very, very bad. I presented data showing that Android based devices currently hold >50% market share and Apple is only around 38%. I then proceeded to tell everyone 82% of new phones being shipped right now are Android based. I also explained that development for Android was much easier than iOS. After I finish making these points my CEO just responds with ""Well, 82% of people are stupid"". Obviously thinking it was a joke, and he just liked Apple more, I responded back with ""Looks like we have a fanboy in the room"". The room went dead silent for the remainder of my presentation. I finish up the presentation thinking it went quite well, and the CEO storms out. One of the VPs in the meeting pulls me aside, and politely fills me in on the fact that our CEO is one of the largest shareholders of Apple. I kinda just left work after that one...  
  
  &nbsp;  
  

TL;DR: Shit on Apple in front of my CEO who's one of the biggest investors in the company and called him a fucking fanboy  
  
Edit: rip inbox  
  
Edit2: in the presentation I talked about expanding to iOS when the time presented itself. For now, having the fully designed android app fits everyone's needs. That's why the slide was titled ""Why Android Initially""   
  
Edit3: yes, I own an android. Would I call myself a fan boy? Maybe. I just prefer superior hardware (for lower costs) and open source. Whatever platform offers me that is the one I'll choose. I stated the android facts not to discredit apple, but to show the usefulness of having the android app. An iOS app could not be created in near the time I made the android app, because I would have had to learn other languages etc. It was also just flat out not needed initially. "
3xqjo2,non_TBI,"This massive fuck up actually happened yesterday, but it didn’t dawn on me until now that it would be horribly right for this sub. 

So last night my wife decided to make Turkey A La King for dinner since we had some frozen leftovers from Thanksgiving. It’s important that I note we also had a full size Ham also in the freezer that my wife was planning on baking for Christmas Eve dinner. 

So my wife was in the kitchen listening to music and dancing around like the causal gomer she is, and I was in my office playing some Fallout. After listening to all the commotion my wife was making I decided that it would be a great time to sneak up and scare her, a thing I do regularly because my sense of humor is perpetually that of a middle schooler. I creep my way down the hall and around the corner to the kitchen, moving silently like a ninja in the night. She suspected nothing. 

I get to the kitchen and see that my wife is rummaging around in the fridge with both the its doors wide open. Our fridge is rather old and the freezer is on top, so with both the fridge and freezer doors open it was impossible for my wife to see me creeping up on her. The scare was going perfectly. I moved up and crouched right behind the freezer door and stayed perfectly still, keeping a manic look on my face that resembled the one Jack Nicholson makes in The Shining. 

After about four seconds my wife swings the door shut and immediately throws her hands up and screams, seeing her psychopath of a husband with a murderous grin on his face. I then hear a loud thud and an audible crunch. It sounded like someone threw a bowling ball on a bag of Cheetos. My wife immediately lets out an agonizing scream which quickly transitioned into a tidal wave of guttural profanity. I apologize like quicker than Charlie Sheen in confession and move around the fridge to see what she dropped.

That’s when I saw the blood. She was wearing these pink fuzzy socks, and the one on her right foot was immediately soaked in blood with some amount of skin and bones protruding out. She was moving the frozen Ham out of the way to get the leftover turkey when I scared her and the Ham fell on her foot. I lost my shit. My wife was crying and screaming and I ran around the kitchen like a turkey with its head cut off looking for my phone. After a few seconds (obligatory “which felt like hours”) I grabbed my wife’s iPhone and called for an ambulance. 

The ambulance came and took her to the hospital, all the while her cussing me out like a sailor in heat and me frantically apologizing and trying to explain to the ambulance drivers that I did not take a sledgehammer to my wife’s foot, and was actually just a complete fucking moron. 

Now she’s scheduled to have surgery tomorrow and our plans for taking a New Year’s cruise are cancelled. Also, her father is going to come by and have a chat with me tomorrow morning. 

TLDR; It wasn’t the Grinch who ruined Christmas this year.

3glz3w,non_TBI,"So this happened yesterday at lunch. I am an intern at a big engineering company in another country this summer. I am an incredibly difficult person to embarrass, but 24 hours later and I am still blushing at this situation.

I (female) emailed the Director of Engineering (male) and I asked if he wanted to grab lunch one day before I leave this summer. We proceed to exchange some brief emails about when (it happened yesterday, same day as the emailing started - all very quickly). The emails were in Spanish. I am not bilingual, but I am learning. This is a critical detail.

So we finish emailing and we meet at 11:30 to go out to a restaurant and we have a nice lunch, we talk the entire time in Spanish (slowly) and it was very fun and interesting. Then, as we are right about to reenter the work building on our way back from lunch, he stops me and speaks in English (weird, considering the past 1.5 hours were in Spanish, so I felt immediately like he wanted to make sure I understood his next words clearly).

He says ""You know, you said something really funny in our emails... "" And he flips through his phone and shows me my last email to him. ""I know it's not what you meant to say, and I appreciate you are trying to learn the language, but this does not mean what you think it does..."" And he points to the last line of my last email to him, which reads: *Estoy emocionada para almorzarnos*.

I meant to say ""I am excited for us to eat lunch together"". Apparently, as he described to me, that actually means: ***I am excited for us to eat each other out (sexually) for lunch***. 

I told the director of engineering at a global engineering company this. Wow. 

Well we clarified things and had a chuckle, and I think we diffused the situation pretty well... But.. Needless to say I am still astronomically embarrassed.

**TL;DR Translated Spanish incorrectly and offered to have oral sex for lunch with the director of engineering of the company where I intern.**"
4282dl,non_TBI,"Well then, I hope you guys are ready for a sob story.

As is custom with these things it should be noted that this did not in fact happen today, it happened on new year's eve 2015.




So to get the formalities out of the way: Yes, I do mean blown it off, as in I now only have 1 hand. Yes, I was stupid and I believe I got punished enough for that. 

And yes, I am typing this with one hand.




Anyway, me and my friends have always been fans of fireworks. It started young with my dad having connections left and right and getting all the illegal fireworks that 10 year old kids could ever want. I still think it is beautiful stuff, even after what's happened. But I digress. 

This particular newyears we were messing about with something called cobra 8. They're basically big dynamite sticks that blow like fucking grenades, so you can see why they're illegal.

These things are made in a factory in italy or something, where I heard they are actually legal. The thing is that when you light the fuse you have about 10 seconds before the fuse runs out. Once that happens a warning flame burns for another 10 seconds, and then it goes off. That's if you get the original product, however. Sometimes you'll get imitations which don't have the warning flame and shorter fuses.

This was, unbeknownst to me, the case.



As I placed one of these things on the driveway my friends were talking to eachother about the immense blow they were about to experience. I got my lighter and tried to get the fuse going. 

Next thing I know I'm sitting on the floor, ears ringing and a weird tingling sensation in my right hand. The thing had gone off with my hand and face right over it. Eardrums ruptured and hand ripped clean off. This, however, I did not realise yet.


Funny thing is, when your hand get's ripped off you expect excruciating pain but I didn't realise what had happened for a few seconds. I was sitting on the ground, thinking ''what happened?'' as my friends started pulling on my shoulders. Their mouths were moving and they looked visually shaken. I couldn't hear them, all I felt was a ringing noise and a tingling hand, which started tingling more and more. 
One of my friends pointed at my right arm, and I decided to look at it. 

That was the most shocking moment I've ever experienced. It was gone. Ripped off. A bit of bone and some flesh was all that was left of my hand. I tried moving my hand but, of course, it didn't move. It was gone. Now that I was looking at it suddenly I could feel it. My wrist, right where the hand was blown off, started hurting more than anything I'd ever felt before. I started screaming and desperately grasped at the missing hand with the other hand. The next thing I remember is when I was in the hospital after my friends had taken me there.



As it turns out, I had actually gotten lucky. Remember how I said I was hovering over with my hand AND head? If my hand hadn't been in the way my head would've suffered considerably more damage than just burst eardrums. 



Fast forward a year and I still haven't quite gotten over the loss of my hand. My passion was playing the piano, and I was just starting to learn guitar. Neither of those hobbies is now possible and I spend many a night crying while listening to old piano recordings I made. To worsen things it's the dominant hand I lost so a lot of basic things, like writing, took months before I could do again.


I fucked up. And now I'm suffering the consequences. Please, be careful with illegal fireworks. Especially with the fake stuff.





TL;DR: Got an immitation of heavy illegal fireworks, blew my hand off. Can't play piano anymore.






EDIT: This account is a throwaway, obviously. The reason is I have an account I use frequently but I don't want to infect it with the stigma of this story.

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the support guys :D You all are great."
3uhjqh,non_TBI,"It's 7:30am on Black Friday and a few buddies of mine were getting breakfast at a restaurant before heading out climbing for the day. The restaurant is busy and full of middle aged people we assume are out for the day to enjoy a nice morning meal before enjoying the cold but sunny day. It's a small town so anyone who wanted to do some crazy black Friday shopping probably drove out of town. I was wrong. 

As we're eating, I looked across the street at a local shoe store that a woman just unlocked and walked into. She was getting the store and cash register ready and I realize it's an old ex girlfriend from early high school who got surprisingly attractive. I decided to step out of the restaurant for a second and walk over for a quick chat and see how she's been doing. 

I'm dressed in dirt bag climber style (cut off jeans with long johns on underneath, beanie, ripped shirt etc) and look a little ridiculous as I approach the store entrance. I knocked on the glass and she looked over and took a second to realize who I was. She smiled, came over and unlocked the door to let me in and give me an awkward hug. 

At that moment I'm giving her a hug, her eyes lit up. I turned to see every FUCKING PERSON IN THE RESTAURANT comes running over and through the doors of the shoe store. She obviously still didn't have the register ready, an open sign on, anything ready for the epic retail workers nightmare of Black Friday. 

They came pouring in, her face is going ""Oh god, no no no no no no no."" and all I say is, ""shit, I'm sorry. I'm headed climbing now, good luck!"" and walked out. 

I returned across to the now nearly empty restaurant to visit my friends. ""Dude, we just saw that all go down. You just ruined that girls day!""

Moral of the story, Black Friday is a terrible day to get a retail workers number. "
3z3onb,non_TBI,"Last night my husband, ""Dan"" and I celebrated New Year's Eve with his family. We were both drinking, and just having a good time. After counting down the new year, we went inside and his mom told us just to sleep in his sister's room.

The alcohol intensified both of our libidos, so we started making out. Things began to escalate, and Dan said, ""Hey, let's do butt stuff."" So, in my drunken state, I replied, ""Why the fuck not."" 

He started trying to put it in, but between being intoxicated and it being too dry, it just wasn't going to happen. Dan started looking around his sister's room for some lotion and found two bottles. There was a tube of lotion and a squirt bottle, so he went with the squirt bottle out of convenience.

He put the lotion on his dick, and slowly started to put it in. I was drunk to the point that it didn't hurt too badly, and it was going in fairly easily. Around a minute later, the lotion started getting really cold to the point it burned. I yelled at him to stop, and he pulled out. We both started writhing in pain.

Turns out, he used fucking **menthol** lotion. My vagina and ass burned like a bitch, and he ended up burning his penis and penis hole.

On the bright side, the next morning I was putting the tubes of lotion back in place, and low and behold, the tube of ""lotion"" was actually acrylic paint. So I guess it could've been worse.

TL;DR:Got drunk, got fucked in the ass, and now my shit is minty fresh.

ETA: To the ones who found this fuck up as hilarious as I now do, thank you. To the ones calling me a whore/skank/tramp for trying something with my husband, I hope you spend your year being fucked in the ass by a menthol based paint. "
3w45ze,non_TBI,"This technically didn't happen today, but I still felt like sharing it.

I recently accepted a job to act as a substitute teacher at my local high school. I was relatively new to teaching so it was a pretty nerve-wrecking experience for me. I entered the classroom and immediately introduced myself. I realized that I was stuttering so I just began lecturing math. At this point, I haven't spent anytime time trying to get to learn the faces and names of the kids. 15-25 minutes into the lecture, I was getting a little bit more comfortable and started observing the class. I noticed a kid sleeping at the back of the classroom and said ""Hey, can you please stop sleeping in class?"" The kid didn't respond at all. So I walked over to the kid and as I was walking, I realized that the kid wasn't really sleeping. He was Asian and had really REALLY small eyes. He then realized that I was talking about him and said ""Who me?"" The whole class bursted out laughing. He'll probably be made fun of the rest of the school year.

TL;DR: Called out an Asian student for sleeping in class, turns out he just had really small eyes. He'll probably be made fun of the rest of the school year.

EDIT: Wow, didn't think this would explode. I felt really bad about what happened. Regrettably, I never really had the chance to correct it. I learned my lesson...I guess I'll donate to charity.

3yl99v,non_TBI,"Happened recently.

The Wife has pinched off a couple of kids, so her stomach is...not taut. Anyway, we were getting a bit froggy and, instead of thinking with my smaller brain, my actual brain decided it would be funny to knead her stomach like a big lump of dough.

""What are you doing?""
""Kneading the dough.""

If looks could kill, I'd be dead twice. 

**TL;DR**: Soured her dough

**Edit**

For the record, I love my wife's body. I also love the pun thread and all the great comments. If I could change one thing about this whole fiasco it would be this: the TL;DR would've simply said ""D'oh!"""
2yhmjk,non_TBI,"So this actually happened 3 years ago when my daughter was 4 years old. It was a situation that started out terribly but actually ended up being a funny story my wife and I can now laugh about.... until today. 

We adopted our cat from a local shelter before my daughter was born. He was an orange kitten named Six. The shelter had named him Six because he had six claws on one of his paws. We adopted him and changed his name to Chase, because that's all this cat did. He chased his own tail, dogs, birds, other cats, etc. 

I work from home, and every day I would drop my daughter off at preschool where she'd stay for 4 hours. When I returned to the house after dropping her off on this day, I opened the door to the house and Chase raced outside. I didn't think much of it, because he'd frequently go outside in the afternoons and come back home around supper time. 

A few hours after sitting at my computer working, I got up to get a drink out of the kitchen. I glanced out our front window and noticed a dead orange cat in the middle of our busy street. My heart sank, and I ran out to it. It was definitely dead, and I was so freaked out I panicked and ran into the house and grabbed a shoe box and put him in it. I called my wife at work, and she was devastated. Chase was really more her cat than mine, as he always preferred her lap, and never really paid much attention to me unless he needed something. She told me she was leaving work early and would pick up some flowers and we could have a funeral for him after we picked up our daughter. 

I didn't really know how we were going to tell our daughter. She was an animal lover, and Chase slept with her every night. My stomach hurt just thinking about how this was going to hurt her. 
So my wife comes home and she is crying, and I ask her if she wants to see him. She tells me she can't bear the thought of seeing Chase dead, and just wants to go pick up our daughter so we can honor our precious cat and put him to rest. 

When we pick up our daughter she can see her mommy has been crying and immediately asks what's wrong. My wife can barely get out to her what has happened before breaking down again, so I end up having to tell her, and my daughter starts crying in HYSTERICS before I can even get all the words out. Now, call me a puss if you must, but seeing my daughter cry like that made me cry. 

We get home and while my wife continues to console my daughter by looking through old pictures of Chase, I go out to our backyard and choose a spot to bury our beloved kitty. I dig the hole and go inside to let them know I was ready for our celebration of life for Chase. 

I bring the box out, and my wife and daughter are following close behind and my daughter is clenching a photo of him to her chest while sobbing. I feel horrible. I hug our daughter as she sobs on my chest and I start to tell the story of when we first adopted Chase. 

My wife and I are huddled with our daughter staring down at the box in the ground when all of the sudden an orange cat walks up and rubs his side along my wife's leg. I stop talking and my wife grabs the cat and yells, ""Oh my god! It's Chase! What the hell?!"" and looks at me like I am the scum of the earth. ""Didn't you check the dead cat for the six claws?!"" I didn't. Honestly, as weird as it may seem, it didn't even occur to me in the slightest that this might not be our cat. It was the same color and size, and I was so freaked out I didn't even consider for a minute that it wasn't him.  My daughter was beyond thrilled Chase was still alive, but sad that someone had lost a kitty.

So, we ended up having a funeral for a cat that somebody had lost, even though we never ended up finding out who's cat it was. (We had put up flyers throughout the neighborhood with information.) A few days after this happened, I got a collar with tags for Chase, so I never have to worry about this reoccurring with us OR some other idiot, for that matter. 

Now my daughter is in 1st grade, and today she brought home a journal where on one page they had drawn a picture of a day that they felt very sad. My daughter drew a picture of me, my wife, her, Chase, a box, and above it her teacher narrated the drawing with, ""The day my dad lied and told me my cat died, even though he didn't.""

tl;dr I thought our cat had died, although he hadn't, and my daughter still hates me for it. 
"
44581z,non_TBI,"So over the past few weeks my girl has been carless, so being the considerate individual I like to pretend to be, I've been offering to drive her to and from work. 

It's about 7 p.m. and I'm on my way back from work. I give her a call to double check what time she would be done for the night, and we establish that I'll pick her up at 9 oclock. My exact words were, ""Absolutely, I'll be there at 9."" Rookie mistake not leaving room for error. 

Exactly 50 minutes later, my phone buzzes for a reminder notification. ""Tip off for the Wizards / Warriors game is in 10 minutes!"" Fuck. My mind is racing. Did I buy tickets? Oh my God. Is it February?! How could I have forgotten Mr. Curry was coming to the District tonight?! 

I call my buddy Tim immediately. ""TIM. Where are you right now?"" To which he replies, ""I'm on my way to class, what's up?"" (Tim is in law school at Georgetown, so thankfully he's already in the city.) I remind him about the game and the tickets we purchased way back in December, and we both panic for a split second. Tim asks, ""So, what do we do? Are you coming?"" I tell him about my prior arrangements with Olivia to get her at 9. I say I can't go, right? I can't just leave her stranded at work, right? 

.... 

Here's my thought process: ""Well, sure I can! Olivia is understanding. She knew about the game and would want me to go. I'll just call her a cab to make sure she gets home safely. There's no way she would be that mad at me."" BRILLIANT! Time to execute said plan:

I send a flurry of texts to Liv, the first being this: ""Fuck Olivia the basketball game is tonight.""  The second: ""I literally just left my house I'm already 10 minutes late but Tim and I decided that we are going to go anyway. we both forgot we have no idea how and I'm sorry that I can't come pick you up."" Now you may be thinking, ""why are you speaking in run on sentences man? Ever heard of punctuation?"" Yes, I have. However, at this particular moment in time I was using my voice-to-text function because I'm flying down the expressway and I have no hands to text. 

I make it to the city, scoop my buddy from his apartment, then make it to our seats in time for the second quarter. At this point it's about 9 oclock and I haven't heard from Olivia yet. Tim's asking me how angry she's going to be, and I assure him it's a non-issue. It was odd that I hadn't heard from her yet, so I step out to try to call her again. She answers:

-""Hello?""
-""Hey! Liv, I'm so sorry. Did you get my messages?""
-""Yeah, I got your message. FUCK YOU TOO. HAVE FUN AT THE GAME. ""
-click-

??? Bewildered, I call her back. I assume she's upset because I didn't come to pick her up, so I tell her I'd call a cab for her to get back. I quickly realize that wasn't the problem, it was the first text I sent her. She thought I meant to send that to my buddy Tim, essentially saying exactly what the text said: ""Fuck Olivia. The basketball game is tonight."" When what I meant to say was, ""Fuck, Olivia, the basketball game is tonight!"" 

We laughed about it this morning. I apologized profusely for the mess, but I'd probably do it again to see Steph drop another 51 points. 

TLDR: I accidentally told my girlfriend to fuck off, abandoned her at work, and went to the Washington Wizards game. 

(Music for your time: https://youtu.be/P_i1xk07o4g)"
450fip,non_TBI,"Let me start off by saying for someone who is in their early 20's, I know basically nothing about computers. I know how to google things, download shit and watch porn, but compared to my 60 year old father I am Mr. Robot. You should also know that my Father loves printing shit. He probably loves printing shit more than he loves me. He probably loves printing even more than the dog I know he loves more than me. He is also extremely technologically challenged. Though, I don't blame him for not grasping modern technology, he is of the generation that didn't have a computer in front of them their entire lives. So, whenever he is having trouble with ""that plastic piece of shit"" he looks at me like I am a test tube baby formed from the DNA of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and I offer my technical savant abilities... 

&nbsp;

It all started when I hear him sputtering away to himself about the computer ""being the shits at printing"" and ""Lord Fuck! Google is fuckin' slow today"". I ask him what the problem is and he says that Google is very slow today and he can't print something if he can't Google it. I don't bother to try to explain that the Google search engine relies on the Internet connection for it's speed and that it's just the Wi-Fi that is slow as it never sinks in. He gets up and offers me the chair and asks me to try and fix the laptop before ""it meets it's maker"" to which I reply ""who? SumTing Wong?"". He tells me that's racist and goes outside for a smoke. When he comes back in, I've got the internet network set to that of the previously shut off range extender that he always manages to turn off when vacuuming and it has significantly improved the speed. I also have the Window 10 upgrade in process... 

&nbsp;

So everything is fine the upgrade is doing something, but you can still use your computer while it is getting ready and he gets back to printing the dictionary or whatever it is that he does. After a while he goes to his bedroom and starts yelling at the news and I take this opportunity to finish installing Windows 10. It begins and it looks like it is going to take a while so I head over to my buddy's house. I come back later to find the laptop on the floor, the printer in the sink and a brand new laptop on the desk in place of the old one. WTF.

&nbsp;

Apparently, while I was gone Windows 10 started and my Dad attempted to get on the computer. It clearly didn't work out too well based on what I discovered. When I asked him about it he just said ""that was a piece of junk, when I went to log on it had a virus, it was hacked, I couldn't print anything."" He also breifly explained how a hacker named Cortana was taunting him so he threw the laptop on the floor and went and bought a new one... He asks me if I could set up the printer to the new laptop (which I am pretty sure came with Windows 10...) Instead, I picked the old laptop (miraculously still working) up off the floor, put it on the desk, connected the printer and restored it to Windows 7. I brought the new computer he had bought back to the store and gave him the money back. We haven't really discussed the days events yet, but I can't wait until it's not too soon to tease him about Cortana the hacker and to ask him why the printer was in the sink. We did manage to accomplish something today though, Google is a little bit faster now because of our range extender. You're welcome for the speed bump Google.

3sauf8,non_TBI,"So I'm new to this accounting job and fresh out of college. I'm not used to waking up earlier than 10am, and now I have to wake up at 6. Unfortunately I'm in the habit of sleeping after midnight so I've been getting less than 5 or 6 hours of sleep most days. It's not too bad, but every day I get very tired at around 11am and 4pm. 

Well thankfully my company is very chill. They encourage you to get up and walk around, take a 10 or even 30 (rarely) minute break, no problem. Obviously don't abuse it, be reasonable, but a 15 minute break every 2 hours is very reasonable. 

So I started using 2 of my breaks every day to take a nap. Except there aren't any safe places to nap in this office. There are conference rooms but I can't just take those because if someone needs them then it's a hassle. And I can't just sleep at my desk because that's not the best idea, obviously. 

So there's 2 bathrooms on this floor. One is a normal bathroom with stalls and everything. The other is a private room. Great bathroom, cleaned top-to-bottom daily. There's also a VERY NICE chair in it. Not sure why, but it's a VERY comfortable leather chair. If the door is closed AT ALL then it's being used. So I go in there if I feel too tired, and take a 15 minute nap. 

Now this bathroom inside a customer support center. The other bathroom is very close by (15 second walk) so I'm not preventing anyone from going to the bathroom. So I go in, set an alarm, and sleep. 

I've done that at least 10 times now. I always woke up on time, everything seemed fine. 

Today, I woke myself up 2 minutes before the alarm rang. I was snoring pretty loud. I don't normally snore but I guess when sitting up on a chair snoring is easier?  The fan in the bathroom is pretty loud and people in the customer service center are all talking anyways, so I thought nothing of it. 

Well, when I came out of the bathroom today, one of them joked at me and asked ""had a nice nap?"" to which I replied ""haha yea..how'd you know?"" She told me that I'm actually snoring in there every single day. 

So every day I slept in there, my loud snoring was heard by the entire customer service team, above all their talking, above the bathroom fan. And then they would hear a quiet alarm ring, a fake bathroom flush, and then me walking out. 

I think I'll start sleeping a bit more at home now... 

**TL;DR Slept in the bathroom at work during allowed breaks. Everyone heard me snore, every time.**"

BF and I are both 19 and we have been dating for three years.  Tonight I went over to his house to play some Steam games (I finally got a job and decided to play some games that he recommended), and he wants to test them out on his new laptop.

He decides to show me Surgeon Simulator.

Having had brain surgery a few times, I am absolutely terrified of anything having to do with my noggin organ.  But I say oh fuck, why the hell not.  It's cartoonish, right?  No big deal.

After a nutritious dinner of corn dogs fresh from the oven, I turn my head and he says ""Hey, Nora, look.""  I turn and he has the poor patient's brain lolling about the tool tray and the screen is positively spurting with blood.

I manage to vomit all over his new laptop, his jeans, and his carpeting.  (The dog managed to move away).

He projectile vomits into my hair.

And without further reflection I articulate what's been word on the street for a while: ""ah yeah, that's because X is pregnant heh."" Silence.

3r8dlg,non_TBI,"This FU actually happened on Halloween, but I'm just getting time to post it now.

I don't go out on halloween because I'm in my mid 20s and I'm just not into going out on the same night as people who rage and get drunk on a holiday that was intended for children to enjoy. My neighborhood gets slammed with kids, and I enjoy handing out candy anyway so no big deal.

Kids start showing up at around noon, and throughout the day I handed out over 350+ goodie bags that I made up with 4 pieces of candy in each. It was intense. The last of the kids showed up at around 10PM, right around the time that the hooligans started running around with shaving cream wreaking havoc. My neighbor across the street lost his cool and ended up calling the cops on the kids and they came by and parked two marked cars at the corner of my block for about an hour then they left. Right around this time i notice my neighbor to the right is having a party. Rather, their high school age daughter is having a party. These kids are all wasted, carrying on, but whatever. I was young once. As long as they stay over there it's cool.

So around 11:15 I decide to go out into my back yard to have a cigarette, but I walked through my front door to bring some trash to the cans and I was going to go through my gate into my backyard. As I'm turning the corner I hear a radio.

Now I'm a cop. I know what a radio sounds like. I hear keys jingling and I hear a radio. It's dark though and I can't really see, but I make out the silhouette of a cop walking into my neighbors back yard. The keys, the radio, the shoulder patches from the local PD, and the reflection of the name badge that I caught a glimpse of made me sure that this was a cop. 

I'm thinking in my head that these cops came back that were parked at the end of the block and noticed this party and were walking around my neighbors driveway to see what was going on in the back yard. I decided to go inside and watch what was going on from the window.

All of a sudden there are about 15 kids in the street in front of the house and I see the cop under a street light on his phone. He's sitting with a kid who is clearly black out drunk who can't move. I assumed he was calling to make sure this kid had a ride home and was going to be okay. I can hear his radio, and I notice he has a gun, a nightstick, the whole deal. It's occurring to me now that he's there clearing the party out, but I don't see a radio car anywhere. I'm thinking okay, maybe the call came over the radio and he knew my neighbors so he was coming by after his shift to tell them to cool it or something.

I then start hearing one of these kids asking the cop to mace him. I'm sitting here thinking okay, now I'm sure this isn't a costume. Costumes don't come with mace. I decided to go into my backyard where I could get a better view and hear them better. So i'm sitting there and I decide to break out my camera and start filming this, because if this cop maces this kid he shouldn't be a fucking cop.

One of the kids in the group says something about the kid being 14 and then the kid is asking for more vodka before he gets maced. The cop then starts warning him that it really hurts and it isn't going to be funny. The kid keeps pressuring him and finally he folds. He maces this kid in the street in front of this house!

The kid starts screaming in agony, my neighbors daughter starts telling everyone to get back into the back yard, and this cop starts going with everyone.

I'm sitting in my back yard and I'm fucking astonished. I can't believe that I just saw a fucking cop mace an intoxicated 14 year old. He should have been making sure they weren't in the street carrying on at the very least. He was now going back into the party though which was really freaking me out because now I'm thinking that he's at a high school party drinking with his fucking firearm. Having just seen him mace someone, I'm thinking that it's only a matter of time before he hands his gun to someone to ""see"" and he have a national news story about cops again.

I decide to call the local PD. I tell them who I am, where I live, and what I'm seeing. The guy on the phone freaked out. He said that there would be cops there in 5 minutes. 4 unmarked cars pull up to my house and I'm already standing outside. I show them the video of the cop macing the kid and they go to my neighbors house.

My heart is racing at this point because I can't believe what I just did. I'm thinking I should have gone over there before calling the cops, but I work in a different department and a lot of the guys out where I live don't like people from my department and being that he was drinking I thought he would just tell me to fuck off.

About 45 minutes go by and they have this cop in handcuffs and they're taking him out of the house. They come over to me with his gun belt and tell me they want to show me something. His gun is fake. His radio is real. His mace is real. His mag pouches are empty. His keys are just his keys. His baton is real.

I'm confused as hell and I asked them what the fuck is going on. 

Turns out, this kid's dad is a cop in the department. He's 19 and knows my neighbors daughter from his high school. He thought it would be a good idea to take his dads uniform and gun belt and wear it as a costume.

The local cops told me that I should have gone over there and seen what was going on before calling them. They ended up charging the kid with endangering the welfare of a minor for macing the drunk 14 year old. At least that's what they told me, but they're probably going to bring him in and then make his dad pick him up. I'm sure his dad is going to be in a fuck ton of trouble for letting his kid go out there with one of his uniforms and his gunbelt. 

Now my neighbors think I'm a douche bag for calling the cops on their party and getting their daughter's friend arrested. They're pissed that I called the cops on a party, they don't believe that I thought the guy was actually cop. Now I have to worry about my car/house getting egged or worse. The local PD thinks I'm a douche bag for turning in one of their cops even though he wasn't actually a cop, it's the principle. All in all, a pretty spooky Halloween.

TL;DR: Saw a cop at my neighbors house late on halloween night. Neighbors 18 year old  daughter was having a party and all kids were wasted. Watched cop mace a drunk 14 year old. Called local PD. Turns out he was a kid wearing his dads gear. Local PD and neighbors pissed at me.

Edit: Used the wrong ""they're"". Had to fix it before the grammar police called me in.

Edit 2: Everyone is asking for the video! [Here is part of it.]() I had to cut the end off because I started talking and I mentioned the name of the police department and my neighbors address. I don't want that shit online so I'm not posting it. Unfortunately that was when there was most of the screaming. My iPhone sucks at video in low light, but you can see what's going on.

Last edit: Thanks for the gold! My inbox is over loaded. I'm getting PMs calling me a cunt and a piece of shit. I'm getting messages saying good job, other one's saying I'm a nosy piece of shit. Some of them are saying I'm bad for not charging the kids all with MIP others are saying I'm bad for getting involved at all. Make up your fucking mind people!

**LAST LAST EDIT**: I'm getting tons of crazy PMs. I'm getting people asking me to do interviews for articles, I'm getting people from /r/protectandserve pressuring me to send them photos of my uniform and police ID, I'm getting people going through my post history and trying to identify me, and I'm getting people threatening to ""doxx"" me and post all my info online. I didn't think this post would blow up the way it has, and unfortunately I'm getting way more heat than I am comfortable with. In retrospect I probably shouldn't have even been posting on reddit, but I've seen other cops from my department do it so I thought it would be okay. I'm really second guessing that thought process now. It's for that reason that I've deleted my post history and I'm going to be deleting my reddit account. I don't want to get into trouble for this and I don't want to have some of the local cops knocking on my door or IAB asking me questions because of some article they read in the paper or on Facebook. 

Thanks a ton to the people who gave me gold, sorry it's going to go to waste. I also want to say thank you to all of the people who left positive comments and to all of you who support your local law enforcement. I'll leave this post up though so people can continue to enjoy it. "
3z5rue,non_TBI,"To begin, I masturbated at work. Yup, don't blame me.


My girlfriend decided that sending me an exposed picture of herself was a good idea. Like any other straight man, a naked picture of your SO gets you a tad frisky. In combination with the animal urge I also needed a shit so thought I could kill two birds with one stone.


The bathroom I went to has two cubicles and three urinals. I take my seat in the first cubicle and when the coast is clear, do my business. I. SPUNKED. A LOT. I'm not talking your ickle dribble, I'm talking volcanic eruption.
I cleaned up as best as I could and buttoned up my trousers. As I was leaving and washing my hands I passed one of my senior managers, a nice bloke but stern. We greet each other as we pass and I walk off, checking my phone until he rushes back out of the bathroom and says to me with no subtlety whatsoever, ""WHAT IS THAT MESS?""


I freeze and accompany him as he walks me back into the toilet and asks which cubicle I was in. I realised I could get out of the sticky situation and replied that I was in the second cubicle.


He drags me to the second cubicle where someone had previously been and had there was smeared shit on the toilet ring with a puddle of piss on the floor.


TLDR - Sticky situation turns shitty real quick.


edit: I should add I cleaned up my jizz perfectly; I just froze and though I hadn't.

3xn54p,non_TBI,"Ok so I am the mother of a 12 boy.  Today we were just hanging out and I thought we could catch up on some holiday movies on Netflix.  So I say ""there isn't anything on TV you want to just Netflix and chill? "" I had heard the saying on TV and social media a lot. His face turned bright red and he replied ""what the hell is wrong with you?"" I get mad at his response and ask him why not. Basically we have a 20 min conversation about in my mind why I'm not good enough for him to hang out with, and in his mind why I'm not good enough to have sex with! I said things like ""don't you love me and want to spend quality time with me?"" Finally he embarrassingly explained what it meant.... I said ""DO NOT tell your father.""

Edit: changed capitalization, didn't realize I hadn't capitalizes not as well. 

TL;DR: today I unknowingly asked then begged my son to have sex with me."
2dk3yr,non_TBI,"Growing up I was a stereotypical boy. Played with little toy guns and cars, peed standing up (via a spectacular penis), loved shop class, had a preoccupation with my female teachers... you get the idea. Having the appropriate amount of external protrusions, holes, and inclinations my gender and sexuality were always strongly ""male."" Then puberty hit.

While I'd always been attracted to women (and still am) I developed a sexual interest in men as well. It grew over the years and was kind of awkward; you know that weird feeling that you get when dealing with people you're attracted to? Well I started having that with almost everyone. My platonic friendships felt... uncomfortable... and by my early 20's I'd pretty much stopped developing new ones.

Around this time I took the plunge and with the help of the internet started having sex with men. I'd been having sex with women since I was 17 and it was great, but for the first time since I started dating I was single and there was just something about being penetrated that I really enjoyed. Sometimes it was a good experience, other times it was terribly painful. I chalked it up to ""welp, that's buttsex for ya"" and took it in stride.

In my mid 20's I was hospitalized with severe pain in my lower intestines.  I never had ANY intestinal problems before but suddenly I was passing blood with my stool and thought that I'd somehow perforated my colon. Since I hadn't had anything inserted in a couple years at that point I was clueless as to what could have caused it and a little embarrassed; it turned out that my mother was the only person able to take me to the hospital and she INSISTED she stay until they figured out what was wrong. Nothing more uncomfortable than looking your mother in the face while a nurse inserts a few fingers into your ass to see if some foreign object is jammed in there. I ended up spending most of my hospital visit sedated due to the ridiculous amount of constant pain. After a week I was discharged with the prognosis of an ulcerated colon and put on an appropriate diet. Somewhat regularly since then I've noticed blood when I poop. This is regardless of being penetrated or not. For the last decade I thought this was just a normal thing due to colon ulcers.

This morning I woke up feeling rather horny for buttplay, and being unable to locate my buttplug decided to knuckle-bust the old starfish. I've literally never put my own fingers in my ass beyond the very first knuckle so this was a new one by me. For the most part it felt like any other rectum... except for a ""mushy"" spot about two inches in. At first I thought this was an ulcer and I'd have to abandon ship, but there was no blood... and rather than hurting when I poked it, it felt good!

Could this be my ""male G spot"" I'd heard so much about? I continued to prod with cautious curiosity, slowly building confidence and speed until the neighbor's dog startled me and... OUCH! My finger went ""through"" the soft spot. I pulled it out immediately. Then came the blood. I was concerned, but there wasn't really any pain after a few minutes - I still went to the hospital though.

I decided to give a fake name due to the circumstances, and as a result the doctor didn't have my old records. She asked me some routine questions and I explained what happened while I was being cleaned up, we made some smalltalk and joked around a bit to lighten the mood while she got the glove and lube ready, then in went her fingers. She pretty quickly found the spot, which wasn't sore at all by this point, and a strange look came across her face as she asked me, ""Did you have gender reassignment surgery at some point?""

I assured her I've always been male - having gotten my penis into a variety of embarrassing situations as far back as I can remember I think I'd be aware if it wasn't around at some point. She assured ME that in her professional opinion I have a vaginal tube which opens to my rectum, and that although she wasn't a gynecologist she was pretty sure what I'd poked with my finger was a sort of hymen. She asked me if I wanted x-rays to confirm. Being rather surprised (and poor) I passed. Besides, I know where to go for answers.

It all makes sense now. I could never figure out why my mother was so adamant about being present during my hospital visit for intestinal pain all those years ago. While when I was a child my parents and the doctor would step out of the room and talk after each physical I had prior to coming back in and telling me I was superbly healthy. I don't know that this changes anything about my self-image - I've always been pretty comfortable with my sexuality and feel gender identity to be a rather secondary aspect of my personality. I still feel just as male as I did yesterday. Nonetheless I intend to confront my parents about this over the weekend and figure out WTF is up. Although not an outright lie I feel this would be a huge crime of omission on their part, and if it's the case that I was surgically altered to emphasize one specific gender I'm going to be rather pissed.

**TL;DR**: *I accidentally discovered I may have been born an intersex person, and my parents may have actively hidden that from me for my entire life.*

3b9tcg,non_TBI,"My girlfriend came over today to celebrate our seven months. The plan was to eat take out, then spend a night in at my house watching tv and inevitably having sex. 


After watching a few episodes of Regular Show and finishing our Panera, we start to kiss. Clothes fly off, and sex ensues. You've seen the movies. 


She's posted up on the floor doggystyle, ready. After fucking her for a while, I start fingering her twat and ass. She's blindfolded and gagged with her panties, and this is where things get messy. I get up and tell her to sit tight. I wander around, looking for foreign objects to use during sex. I found a marble (not one of the small ones, but one that's maybe 1.5 inches in diameter). I lubed it up and played around with it in her twat for a bit, then got it back out and inserted it into her asshole. It disappeared in there; I thought it was going to come back out with ease like in the Brazzers videos, but it didn't. I alerted her, prompted her to cough a few times, and still nothing. Now she's in my bathroom taking a hot bath in an effort to unclench her anus so she can pass the marble.

37hcio,non_TBI,"So this happened around a month ago, but I only just gained enough confidence to post it here. I'm a 6'3 18 year old from Sydney, and my 5 year old cousin and I like to take walks along the boardwalk at Darling Harbour. During these walks he likes to drop behind me a bit, and then run up to me. When I hear him coming, I spin around and grab him, spinning my cousin through the air and back down in front of me. Anyway, I heard my little cousin running up behind me, so I turned around and swung him up into the air... Only to hear (mid-swing), a raspy voice exclaim: ""Put me down you giant fuck!""
I saw the little person. Everything went into slow motion, and at the arc of the swing, I let go, causing him to eat the boardwalk. Needless to say he wasn't very happy and I had an angry crowd demanding I explain myself.

Tl;dr - mistook a little person for my 5 year old cousin, swung and accidentally threw him much to his distaste.

3bu4s8,non_TBI,"OK reddit, unlike other stories this happened TODAY! like a few hours ago. Grammar sucks, I'm sorry. So I live in the great state of Texas, where everybody and their mother has guns. So I've been wanting a go-pro for a while and was a little short on cash so I decided to sell one of my guns and go buy my gopro. Anywho I find a buyer and decide to meet up at a local chicken place parking lot. Cool. I get to the parking lot of the place and see two gentlemen in a vehicle and they look like they're waiting for something, cool I found the buyer. I pull next to the driver side and get off my truck and look at the driver and say hello. He replies and says hello as well. Ok, so this whole time I'm thinking he's buying the gun so I open my back door and proceed to pull out my gun. The look of horror on this guys face as I try to hand the gun over to him and jokingly said go ahead and try 'er out there's a round in the chamber (was a joke chamber and tube were empty) Ok... so now the passenger is studdering something and the driver is just staring at me with his mouth open. So i asked you got the money right? then BOOM it clicked! I got the wrong GUY! shit shit shit I said I was sorry and noped the hell outta there. eventually the guy  who was gonna buy the gun called me telling me that he saw the whole thing happened and gave me an extra $5 for a giving him a good laugh.

32pj1w,non_TBI,"I've waited 16 months since marrying my wife to get my US Permanent Residency. I was finally travelling today to finalise everything. I hand him the sealed packet that he has to inspect, he looks it over stoically, silently. All of a sudden he extends his arm towards me, hand up, palm facing me. Without thinking I high five him. His hand is limp. I knew immediately I had done wrong. A look of confusion and anger flashes across his face. Those in the queue behind me fell silent. ""Follow me sir"". Turns out he was about to demonstrate how I give my fingerprints correctly.

I finished the process in a locked room with a different officer and no doubt a lot more questions than I would have otherwise had to endure.

I don't know if anyone has been to the US embassy in London but they have a little security room outside the building with an xray and guards etc and big heavy doors. I've just been through the xray and I'm struggling with my belt and my bag and I'm pushing on the heavy door with a single finger and it won't open (obviously) so naturally I start looking for a [door release]( http://www.jwsltd.co.uk/index.asp?function=PRODUCTIMAGEWINDOW&closedelay=20000&SRC=http://www.jwsltd.co.uk/ekmps/shops/timwainer/images/-door-release-exit-switch-525-p[ekm]300x300[ekm].gif) , see a switch on the door frame, press it, and all the lights turn off.

3p854n,non_TBI,"This was about 2 weeks ago but new info about the story made me want to post it.   I work at an industrial waste water treatment plant, and one of the things we need to monitor is the gasses in the manholes outside.  Our meters test for H2S, CO, O2, and LEL (lower explosive limit of methane).  For testing these manholes we have a little air vacuum that we use to pull air from the lower portions of the holes to test.  High H2S levels are deadly.   (here's 2 pictures of what our equipment looks like  http://imgur.com/a/Km0Zs)

Now I was working 5 days in a row with 12 hour shifts,  and I like food. The day before my shifts  I made a nice triple batch of chili, not just any chili though,  spiced Italian sausage with extra hot seasoning and extra beans kind of chili. You can probably guess what that does to the digestive system...

On the 3rd day of work, after eating maybe 2 bowls of chili a day, I went to take manhole readings on the street with my vehicle.  I have the gas meter hooked up to the vacuum and the vacuum is pumping whilst sitting on my lap while the hose is falling between my legs.  Feeling a nice fart coming on I give a nice push, letting out the fumes of the chili only diet of the last 2-3 days.  The vacuum hose, sitting between my legs, picks up plenty of the gasses and sends them to the gas monitor.  The monitor is astounded at the levels of gas it's receiving and goes berserk with its alarms.  All of the gasses that it monitors were over the reading levels (except for O2, that went under level), and threw the entire monitor out of whack, so I couldn't take my manhole readings.  I shut it down and set it to the side for later.

Now today I've learned that the gas monitor that I had farted into needs to go back to the company to get recalibrated because our calibrations aren't making it work properly...  My farts potentially killed a 700$ piece of equipment...

TL;DR: My manhole smells worse than the others...

-edits- 

We have the monitors fresh air calibrated daily and have them recalibrated elsewhere by the HSE head every 2 months. We keep the monitors calibrated properly so the readings are on point. 

Found the reading limits for the gas meter

H2S PPM: 0-200

CO PPM: 0-1000

O2 %: 0-30

LEL %: 0-100

As for the levels of gas it recieved from my concentrated fart, I don't remember what some of them were,  but the LEL % was at 100%, and the CO went over range.


Good grief, Gilded?? Thank you kind stranger!


Really enjoying most of the comments too  :p
"
3kv0bs,non_TBI,"So this story actually happened yesterday, for what it's worth.
I've been on a new diet/exercise regime for the last few weeks, and every now and then i get really hungry. i'm obsessively counting calories, so i was scouring the cabinets looking for something low-cal to eat. entire can of marinated jalapenos for only 40 calories? bingo!
so i eat the entire can of jalapenos, and go about my day. two hours later, i'm browsing the internet on the couch when i suddenly realize i must make an immediate sortie to the toilet, as bad things are about to happen.

i pull down my pants just in time to unleash a torrent of pepper oil diarrhea. my stomach is churning, and my asshole is on fire. i sit on the john for a while until the pain subsides. as soon as a i stand up, i realize that i've shit not *into* the toilet, but rather all over the back of it. fuck. now i suddenly understand how it happens. *now i'm one of those people.*

horrified by the mess all over the toilet and all over my backside, i tip toe out of the bathroom to the cabinet under the sink, and grab a baby wipe in one hand, and a clorox wipe in the other. cue the fuck up.

absconding back into the bathroom, i promptly forget which wipe was in which hand. the mistake is readily apparent once my anus is ignited into a broiling agony that rivals the deepest pits of hell. shoving a steak knife up my ass would have been a walk in the park compared to this torment.

so, i start screaming and my partner comes running, only to find me clutching my shit-covered butt in a shit-covered bathroom, sobbing. a bit much for a month old relationship...

tl;dr - confused the wipes, wrecked ma pipes."
3o36d1,non_TBI,"Ok, my first ever post but this has to be the funniest most awful mistake I have ever made. I was composing a message on FB to my sister in law with a pic of her wedding dress in it from a dress fitting she had. I could not find where my photos were on the family laptop so went in to a folder that was marked viber downloads thinking it might be in there. No mini pics appeared on the screen, just little text boxes. I clicked on the first one and it opened up straight into the fb message to my sister in law but I didn’t know that yet. I was shocked to see a pic of my husband holding his bits on screen but remembers the pic from previously. He had an infection and sent me a photo of the infection because he was doing an awful job describing it over the phone.  I suddenly remembers I was composing a FB post to my sister in law..... There is was in all its glory.... of course she was anxiously awaiting the pics of her dress and so obviously opened it the second it came in to her in box. I laughed, then I cried, then I screamed and then laughed again. 

I then explained the pic as she had seen it but not replied. we laughed about it. When I told my husband what had had happened he stood up and said ' for fuck sake' and went to the pub. He later saw the funny side but for the last two days he has been letting off loud cringing noises at random.

3wolt7,non_TBI,"I was taking a two hour history final in a tightly packed room. The desks were barely a foot apart. Somehow the desk behind me was pushed up to my chair and the girl behind me was bending down over her exam. I straightened up and stretched my neck by moving it back and looking at the ceiling in a swift motion (to crack my neck). My head nailed that girl on her head and she was so surprised she slammed her head into the desk. She down fell out of her chair holding her forehead and somehow pulled the desk down on top of her. She was alright and finished her exam. (first time posting on tifu)

edit: and I was very, very sorry.

edit: [diagram](http://imgur.com/D0BPZZ7)

edit: because people doubt the existence of stretching necks. I stretch this way because it straightens my neck and cracks it. I have horrible posture so leaning my head back kinda fixes the orientation. Plus it feels nice. Just lean your head back all the way and stare at the ceiling for a few seconds.

edit: because too many people are hurting themselves. TO DO THIS CORRECTLY JUST LEAN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY BACK AND STARE AT THE CEILING.

tl;dr during an exam I reverse-head-butted a girl behind me by stretching so as to crack my neck; she ended up on the ground"
3m7ycq,non_TBI,"There are a lot of stray cats near where I live. One of them, who some of my friends have named Troubles, is actually quite friendly unlike the others. I'm walking to work (about a 2 min walk from my front door), and notice Troubles sitting on the dirt path, sunbathing. He sees me, and meows. I of course, meow back at him, which leads to him walking over to me. I start petting him, and he rubs himself against my leg, purring etc. 20 minutes go by, and I'm still hanging out and playing with Troubles. I am now late for work. I get to work, and understandably my boss demands to know why I was late. I'm then berated for being a ""child"" after I explained that the reason I was late, is I was distracted by a cat.

TL;DR: I, a 23 y/o man was late for work because I couldn't resist playing with a friendly kitty.

Edit: I left early for work, because I was gonna make coffee there, so even after 20 minutes of pussy petting, I ended up only being about 5-6 minutes late."
40um80,non_TBI,"So this actually happened yesterday. My husband and I were making dinner and started play-fighting. I tried to pinch hus butt, he pinned my arm and started tickling me, and I went to slap him lightly on the cheek. As my hand was approaching his face, I suddenly remembered I've been growing my nails, and they're long enough to do some damage. I didn't want to hurt him! So did i stop my hand? Of course not...it was too close to stop the contact, so I did what any sane person would do. I curled my fingers in so they wouldn't scratch him....into a fist...

and punched my husband in the face."
2cf1xd,non_TBI,"Debated about creating a throwaway for this one, but decided to kind of just embrace my past. So like a lot of TIFU stories, this happened a while ago. 

This was eight years ago when I worked at a megaplex movie theater in Orlando. It was a summer day and I was tearing tickets. Usually ticket-rippers switched off after two hour shifts, but I enjoyed getting paid to just stand at the podium, doodle on theater schedules, and pretty much do nothing, so I usually volunteered to just rip tickets for my entire eight hour shift. Anyways, it was summer and it was a particularly hot and muggy day in Florida, so a lot of the female customers were wearing short shorts, tank tops, etc. Like any horny seventeen year old male, this was all rather relevant to my interests and I got to the point where I needed to release the tension that had built up throughout the day. 

Towards the end of my shift, I took a fifteen minute break and went into one of the handicap restrooms to jerk off (the nice restrooms with a single toilet, sink, and where you can lock the door). Now when I do the deed, I like to be laying down. Don’t ask me why, it’s just something I’ve always done since I was little. I guess I like to be able to stretch out my legs and I can also finish quicker that way. Since time was of the essence here, when I got into the handicap restroom I laid out on the floor and proceeded to jerk it. They cleaned the restrooms regularly and I’m not much of a germaphobe, so the fact that it was a restroom floor wasn’t an issue. Anyways, I guess in my haste in getting in and getting off, I didn’t properly lock the door. To this day I don’t know why the door didn’t lock. I can only assume I didn’t turn the latch all the way. About half way through my jerk off session, the door opened and one of my female co-workers came in to clean. Now I was laying on the ground along the wall that the hinges to the door were closest to, so when she opened the door and pushed it inwards, she didn’t see me at first because I was hidden on the other side of the door. She managed to enter the restroom without seeing me laying there on the floor behind her with my pants down. I knew I was dead in the water and it was only a matter of seconds before she would turn around. So I had to think fast. At the time I had recently watched some CNN documentary about kids with epilepsy. As the girl turned, I started convulsing on the ground and pretending to be having a seizure. The girl yelled “Oh my God!” as I just lay there shaking violently on the ground and staring off into space. She ran out of the bathroom and started screaming in the lobby for someone to help. As soon as she stepped out, I quickly pulled up my boxers to at least conceal my penis. Luckily the sheer terror of the door opening killed a good 75% of my erection on the spot, so I like to think it didn’t look like I had a boner. On the bathroom floor I debated how to proceed. I knew people would be entering any second. I then realized I was at the point of no return. 

The assistant manager of the theater soon burst into the bathroom and I continued to convulse on the floor. He kind of just knelt by my side and put his had on my shoulder as I continued to shake there like an idiot. I mean there wasn’t much he could have done. An ambulance arrived in literally three minutes. When the paramedics came in, I decided it was time to “snap out of it” and so I stopped convulsing and just started to grovel on the floor and pretend to not know where I was. They put me on a stretcher and wheeled me through the lobby to their vehicle. A good sized crowd had formed at this point. They were about to take me away in the ambulance, but I got off the stretcher and insisted that I was fine. I made up some story about having had seizures my entire life and that this happened to me a couple times every year. I kept insisting that I was fine and was able to talk the paramedics into leaving. 

The theater had my mom as an emergency contact so she eventually came and took me home. I could never tell my parents what really happened, so to this day they think I really had a seizure. In the following months I had to take several neurological tests, had to do several overnights at the hospital, and was put on a few medications (that I only pretended to take when in reality I flushed the pills down the toilet). Thank God for health insurance. In retrospect, it would have been better to have just gotten caught jerking off then to have had to go through all the lies, doctor appointments, and medical bullshit. This is where the true TIFU aspect of this story lies. After a while it looked like “the seizure” was just a freak one-time thing and it finally all kind of just went away.

I ended up working at that theater for another couple years and people were always really nice to me and thought I was just some poor schmuck who had a seizure while trying to take a shit.

TL;DR: Pretended to have a seizure to get out of getting caught masturbating at work"
3kne2n,non_TBI,"So this actually happened on Monday (don't kill me.)
I'm from Britain and I'm currently in sixth form (junior and senior year for any confused Americans)
SO, in college, you get 'frees' which basically are periods where you can do whatever as you don't have a lesson and they're usually an hour long.

In my case, I had three frees in a row, so me and my friend decided to go out shopping for a little while and then come back for our last lesson.

ANYWAY.

Skip to three hours later and we were making our way back to college, near our college there's a church.

This is where it gets bad.

I looked over at the church and saw that there was a family walking out of it, they were smartly dressed so I'd assumed they'd just come from a wedding, as a large majority of the family weren't wearing black. 

And me being me, I can't keep my gob shut and exclaimed
""Congratulations!""

To which my friend turned to look at me in sheer shock/terror. Not knowing what she was so shocked about, I looked towards the family, who's jaws had practically hit the ground.

It was only THEN, I saw a couple holding a large framed picture of a little boy.
I walked as fast I could, not bearing to look at the couple, who I could now hear sobbing hysterically.

TL;DR - Thought a funeral was a wedding, accidentally congratulated a couple on their sons funeral.


EDIT: So I was reading through the comments and couldn't help notice how many people were confused about if I was a boy or a girl; I am a girl."

44sia2,non_TBI,"Right off the bat, two thing. 1) as with all things, this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago. 2) I'm on mobile so things might be a bit fucky with the formatting.
 
Last weekend my sister and her husband were heading out of town and I got to be the responsible uncle for my 10 year old niece, who we'll call emily. Which is super awesome. I get to see my sister and brother in law a lot so I've built up a pretty good relationship with Emily over the past few years. So Saturday morning they drop her off at my apartment, give hugs all around, and hit the road. Emily gets a bit flustered, but does that worry me? Fuck no. I'm the cool uncle, and I got the prescription for this panic attack. I pack her up into the car, and we hit the mall. We grab breakfast, and spend all day hitting one shop right after another. By the time we get to build-a-bear she's on cloud 9.

We waste the whole day away and get home. As soon as we get through the door she crawls on to the sofa and is out like a light. I grab a blanket and cover her up. 

So I waste a bit of time playing halo, keep an eye on her, make sure she's alright. About 5 she wakes up, and I go ahead and make dinner. And then smooth cool uncle strikes again. Boom! Ice cream for desert. And what goes good with ice cream? Movies. Blazing saddles. Loves it. Spaceballs. Even more. Princess bride? Fucking rolling. I've got this kid in the palm of my hand.

10 o clock rolls around. Bed time. She's begging and pleading ""don't make me go to sleep! More movies!"" and yes, I want to be the cool uncle, but I also have to be the responsible uncle. So I call my sister. ""Emily wants to stay up and watch movies, what do?"" and she says, it's fine as long as she gets plenty of sleep before they come get her tomorrow night. 

I'm digging it, so I tell Emily to go pick out another movie, and go back to talking to my sister. ""How's the trip? Everything alright? Blah blah blah."" as I'm still on the phone Emily comes running back up to me, movie in hand. And out of all the movies on my shelf which one does she pick out?

Poltergeist.

What fucking 10 year old wants to see poltergeist?

So I go back to talking with my sister. ""Uh, there's no way I can let her watch this."" and she responds, ""no it's ok, but if she gets too scared, movie goes off and she goes to bed."" and against my better judgement, I let her. I did tell her it was a scary movie before we started, but she just have me that thousand mile smile and said she wanted a scary movie.

Alright kid.

To my surprise, she did fairly well through most of the movie. She huddled into her blanket and let out a few gasps and yelps every now and then, but every time I asked if she was fine she just smiled and said yeah more movie.

Until. The pool scene. For some reason the skeletons in the pool freaked her the fuck out over the rest of the movie. So I took my sister's advice, I turned the movie off, switched it over to boomerang, and tried to call her down.

And here's where the fuck up comes.

As I'm calming her down she keeps talking about how scary the skeletons were and she hated skeletons and started crying a bit, so I'm trying to talk her down, and thanks to you fuckers, I say the first thing that pops into my mind.

""It's ok honey, skeletons are fine, everyone has a skeleton inside them, even you.""

And in that moment. As her eyes got wider and wider, and tears starting flowing like Niagara falls. I knew. I fucked up.

Almost instantly she's in full panic mode. Shaking, full on bawling, screaming, and then she barfed. Ice cream and pizza melted together into the fibers of my sofa. I'm in full lock down mode now trying my best to take control of the situation. It ain't happening. So I have to call my sister who instructs me to take her to our mom's house so she can take care of her. I bundle her up as best as I can, and she is dead silent for the entire car ride over. I passed her off to my mom, and went back home to salvage my couch. 

Sunday my sister called and said she picked her up and Emily wouldn't say a word about anything that happened all day Saturday. She told me she wasn't as mad as she should be, because I did get the go ahead from her for a scary movie, but I was a dumbass for telling her she had a skeleton. Wat?

Friday I got a call back from my sister, telling me Emily wouldn't stop talking about going to the doctor to ""get her skeleton out"", leading to several conversations about why Emily had to keep her skeleton inside her. Followed by my sister telling me that she tried to bring Emily back over to my apartment and was met by several tantrums.

Tldr: mr. Skeltal scared my niece with too much calcium and reset three years of trust bulding.

Edit: I saw a couple of people mention why she freaked out about skeletons being inside of her at 10 years old. I called my sister and asked her to pry a bit more info out of Emily. Apparently she took what I said to mean she actually had one of the skeletons from the movie inside her. Like a pile of fresh fleshy bones just hanging inside of her. I would have thought that through a bit more that night if I hadn't been freaking out myself trying to calm her down. So thankfully she isn't freaked out about HER skeleton it's just spoopy movie skeletons she has a problem with.

Double edit: obligatory whoo thanks for the gold!!!!

Triple edit: I've gotten quite a few replies asking if she's ""special"". She is not. She was just freaked out from the movie, and misunderstood what I said, which freaked her out even more. I've gotten an update from my sister and it seems she's already starting to understand what I was saying, and she does not have a poltergeist skeleton inside her. Just her normal old skeleton she was born with."

She was really happy reading the card until 20 seconds in she just looked at me with angry eyes. She threw the card at me and said ""seriously?"" I felt strange that she did such a thing. At first I thought she was mad because the card wasn't good enough but it didn't really make any sense to me so I picked the card up and read it. Everything was normal until the last line.

""If I was asked to put a price tag on you I couldn't because you are just too WORTHLESS""

I don't know how I could fuck up something so simple. I meant to write ""priceless"". Even after I explained it to her she was still unhappy about it and I basically ruined our valentines day.

2vfjui,non_TBI,"As everyone knows, school can get to us. Every morning i struggle to wake up and get out of the house in time to catch my bus. This morning in particular, was very different.

 I woke up and frantically checked my clock, because i was late yesterday. Through my groggy eyes, all i saw was "":45"". Typically i leave the house at 6:30, so i jumped out of bed and quickly got dressed. I ran downstairs and out the door, ignoring the fact that nobody in my family was awake yet. The fact that it was still dark didn't bother me because where I live, the sun doesn't rise until about 7:30.

 On my way to school, I noticed that there were not as many cars on the road as usual. I kept walking, because I was just focusing on not being late. About 30 minutes later, I reached the main road that lead to my high school. There were absolutely no people or cars anywhere. I thought I was dreaming or that the roads were shut down. I checked my phone to see if i was late or at least close to being late. It was 1:15 AM. I just kinda sat there hating myself for a minute, then realized how much of a fucking idiot I was. I slowly turned around and walked home, wondering if my family had woken up and saw me missing. Luckily I made it back to my room without disturbing anyone. 

TL;DR: I tried to go to school at 1 AM.

2xfmzz,non_TBI,"So I had a surgery Monday afternoon. Bunions are genetic in my family, and for some reason, mine are particularly bad for a 23 year old. I elected to get the surgery now, while under my mother's insurance and to prevent it from getting worse. Also, this way my mom can take a few days off work to stay with me if I need anything.

Long story short, they had to break 2 of my bones, then realign them, add some screws and pins, file down the side of my foot, then put the bones back into the sockets. I have 12 stitches and am on heavy narcotic drugs for pain. 

Well, I have a super high sex drive. I flicked the bean before surgery Monday, but it's been 4 days. So I was horny and put on some porn. So I'm going at it and getting really into it. A few attempts at finishing pass because of mild pain in my foot. I decide to play through the pain.

Bad.

So I'm finally about to come, and I get ready, straighten my legs. And I curl my toes as I climax, as I always do.

I curl my fucking toes. 

There's a loud **CRACK** then my earsplitting scream of pure fucking agony. Then I have about three seconds to think *Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, what did I do* before my mom comes barreling through my door. 

There I am, covered in sweat, vibrator in hand, porn still on my TV, and my mom staring at me in shock. She stammered ""Are you... uh, oh. Um. Are you o-okay? Uh..."" She keeps glancing from me to the TV. I'm yelling at her that I'm fine, just go, I'm fine, **GO.** But she's in shock I think because she's still just glancing wide eyed from (half naked) me, to my TV, back to me, then my foot. 

So I throw something at her to wake her out of her confused daze to make her go. The only thing I had within reach. My vibrator. 

I threw my vibrator at my mother. 

She backed out of my room slowly. We haven't spoken since.

2q0yad,non_TBI,"Alright a bit of background. Ive been a piercer at my local tattoo parlor for several years, and I have seen people do the simplest things like eyebrow piercings, cartilage piercings, etc. Ive also seen people do the most bizarre things like dick/clit/ball piercings, and even anus piercings. Ive only done 2 anus piercings in the 6 years i've worked there. This guy comes in, and says he wants his asshole pierced. I wanted to laugh, but I put my professional face on, and told him prices, and answered his questions. 

We get to the piercing room, and I tell him to pull down his pants and get on all 4s up on the table. Awkward already... Now Im trying to get him to position his ass cheeks just right so I can get to his asshole. I finally get him to spread his ass cheeks apart, and I get my needle. I can tell the guy is getting really nervous so I said ""Dont tense up man just relax its only gonna take a second. Just relax your anus don't tense up or it will only be worse."" 

I have my face right up to this guys anus and am about to pierce him, and I say ""Ok here we go"". 2 seconds after I get the needle in he blasts shit all over my face. I start screaming like a motherfucker trying to wipe shit off my face, and he starts trying to stand up but the needle is still in his ass, and he screams bloody fucking murder. My boss runs in to find me wiping shit off my face, and this poor fuck screaming and crying with his pants down.

After I got cleaned up, and we got the needle out his ass I said ""WHY DID YOU SHIT ON ME??!"" He just stood there obviously embarassed, and he says ""You said to relax my anus! Im so sorry!""

3k07p4,non_TBI,"A few weeks ago, my cousin was driving behind a Ford Galaxy on a rural road. As the cars went over a bump, something fell from the wheel well of the car in front of her. She slammed on her brakes and got out of the car to see it was a tiny orange kitten! (She never could find the owners, and we assume he was a feral cat)

Because I just had to put down my 17 year old orange cat, she decided to let me have the kitten, which we appropriately named 'Galaxy', due to his origin story. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks. I just bought a Samsung Note 4. Ever since I got the phone, it has been doing weird things. Namely, the voice recognizer will randomly turn on and search for things while I am casually browsing reddit. I couldn't figure out why, and the staff at the store was of no help.

A few minutes ago, my kitten jumped on my lap while I was browsing twitter. So I said ""oh hi, Galaxy, silly kitty!"" Then my phone started a Google search for ""silly kitty"". (""Hi, Galaxy"" is the phrase to start voice searches on samsung phones)

316puo,non_TBI,"I hate all the excessively long posts so I'm going to keep this short.

My little sister is 6 years old. The way I convinced her she was invisible was simple; I took a picture of our couch before she was on it. Then, I called her and she came to me and I pretended I couldn't see her. Naturally, she didn't believe me. So, I told her to sit on the couch and I'll take a picture.

BUT HERE'S THE ZINGER: I showed her the old picture with no one on it. This was all it took to convince her.

Unfortunately, people react differently to learning they are invisible. She was skipping around tormenting my other family members (they were in on it too). It was pretty harmless until she started picking her nose and whatnot.

We had to stop the gag when she began to undress. We gave her some honey and said it was anti invisibility potion and that was that."

347yfm,non_TBI,"Like most of the other posts in this subreddit, this didn't really happen today (or this year), but a few years ago when I was in high school. 

It was my senior year in high school and wrestling season had just ended. My aunt sent me a congratulatory musical card -- the kind that plays part of a song when you open it -- which I thought would be fun to tape to the inside of my locker (I shared this locker with a friend of mine) so that it played every time I opened it. This one played ""Simply the Best"" by Tina Turner. It worked, and I enjoyed it for a few days until the weekend which I spent in the mountains on a hiking trip with my dad and brother. 

When the trip was over I checked my phone and saw that I had a voicemail from my locker-mate saying there was ""a bomb scare or something"" and that I had to talk to my principal on Monday. That Monday morning, I met with my principal who explained to me that a night janitor heard a ticking noise coming from my locker (apparently that's what those cards start to do when they run low on battery) and called the police, who called the bomb squad, who shut down the two major intersecting roads near my school and brought in a robot to inspect my locker. When the robot x-rayed the locker, they saw the ""device"" taped to the door, some half-empty water bottles that happened to be on the top shelf that they thought must have been chemicals or explosives. They also thought they saw wires connecting everything together. Eventually they saw the monstrosity for what it was and shut down the operation, but apparently it was a pretty elaborate production. The article made the front page of the local newspaper the next day, complete with a photo and everything. 

I never really got into trouble in high school and the principal knew who I was, so after talking for a few minutes we agreed that the whole thing was an honest mistake and that there was no malicious intent (although he said some parents were upset to the point that they wanted me suspended, expelled, or even to pursue some kind of legal action) and he let me off the hook.

In his own words: ""I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to lecture you about, but I have to say something. I guess don't... uhh... modify lockers anymore?""

[Here's the article](http://www.pottsmerc.com/article/MP/20090407/NEWS01/304079981)

Of course, unless they are prompted, they don't pick up said garbage when it lands outside of the can. Due to this, I've gotten pretty good at throwing down a stern ""You need to pick that up. **Now.**"" phrase in the blink of an eye. 


Teaching a lesson across the room? Bam! 

Breaking up a fight between other students? Bam!

No trash goes unnoticed.


So today I'm walking into the grocery store and pass two men off to my side. Immediately my brain registers the motion of the jump shot and a paper bag landing far away from the trash can. 


Teacher brain kicks in and I look at them very sternly and say ""You need to pick that up. **Now.**"" 

Almost immediately upon saying this my brain realizes I am not in class, these are not my students, and those men were not about to simply leave their trash on the sidewalk. 

Too late. 

Now, to add insult to injury, I am a pretty young teacher who typically appears to be in her teens while donning day clothes, as I was. These men were probably 10+ years my senior.

One of the men quietly mumbled sorry while looking at the ground. The other, somewhat frantically apologetic, explains that he was just about to pick it up and *really really* wasn't going to just leave it there. He promised. 

In the midst of my embarrassment and lack of a good explanation for their sudden scolding, I just said ""good."" and continued into the store. 


TL;DR: I scolded grown men outside the grocery store because they reminded me of my Bobcat-esque middle school students.  

*Edit:* wowzers! I'll try to respond more later today. 

Since a couple people have inquired: I don't mind the shooting of the trash. It's the missing and leaving garbage on the floor that I don't allow. We actually have a little score card going on the board for when they make a shot. The points are irrelevant and don't really do anything, but they haven't seemed to catch on to that yet. 

Edit 2: I finally understand RIP inbox. Also, death threats? Seriously?! Ya'll need a chill pill. Or detention. ;)

Gold??? That's awesome :D

3d94jc,non_TBI,"This has actually been happening for 8+ years. 

Since i was a kid, my mom would always tell me how  healthy tea was for you, and how much antioxidants it had in it.

Well, i took that **too** literally. In order to get all them goodnesses, i would rip open the tea pack and pour in all of the spices and drink them. This would result in me coughing out my lungs and a dry throat. I thought ""oh well, its worth it for all those goodnesses."" Until today, when i was drinking tea at my girlfriends house and both her and her parents saw me and proceeded to laugh their assses off. They then took a couple pictures of me, had them processed and hung. My mom now wants some prints of those pictures as well. We're driving to Walmart right now to pick them up.

385j4p,non_TBI,"So my two buddies and I dropped acid in my empty house.  We ordered pizza for dinner since we couldn't go anywhere.  time passes  by and we realize it's probably time to get our money together. the three of us go out to the main foyer to count money. my one friend asks, ""what do you got b?""  and since I recently broke a hundo I had a bunch of cash in my wallet so I started fanning it out.  He asks again, ""what do you got b?"" this time more  of a chant.  I start makin it rain with my money and now my two friends are chanting ""what do you got b?! what do you got! what do you got b!? what do you got?!

Im now making it rain and dancing while taking my shirt off like its a dance circle.  we are having such a good time, vibing, laughing, that other friends follow suit, one taking his shirt off, both emptying the contents of their wallets on the floor, all three of us chanting, ""what do you got b? what do you got?!"" and dancing in front of the front door totally forgetting what we were supposed to be doing when all of a sudden there is a pound on the door.  WHAM WHAM WHAM. 

all of the color drains from our faces and turns to unadulterated laughter. we open the door, the three of us shirtless with money and cards and shirts all over the floor, scrambling to find $25.  
sent that pizza guy back with a nice story."

Sorry for your suddenly-sodden panties, ladies. 

Definitely not my dream career as a kid – the Fisher Price Banking Is Fun! playset is not a big seller – but when I lost my job selling computers in my early 20s I got this job and it stuck like soiled underwear. I’m okay at it and I’m a well-liked mentor to many of the staff, but I’m definitely a goofy round peg in a humourless square hole which is what ultimately led to my WTF shitstorm.

If I have to work in an office I’m gonna have a bit of fun. I love ThinkGeek. In my office I have a [Conan the Barbarian letter opener](http://i.imgur.com/xwQpqAjh.jpg), a [Salvador Dali melting clock](http://i.imgur.com/hG0OT5q.jpg) and a [magnetic levitating world globe](http://i.imgur.com/rm1luHbh.jpg) among other things purchased there, and as fate would have it this past Christmas in my stocking I discovered that my kids bought me an [Annoy-a-Tron](http://i.imgur.com/vfO4Usi.jpg). It’s a small device that makes maddeningly short, faint noises at totally random intervals and can run for 3 months on a watch battery, designed to be hidden to drive someone harmlessly bonkers. Here’s the description [from ThinkGeek’s site:](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b278/?pfm=Search&t=the%20thinkgeek%20annoy-a-tron%202.0)

*“The Annoy-a-tron will do its part to drive your co-workers slowly mad with its short and seemingly random beeps. And when someone does locate the Annoy-a-tron, they're not going to know what it is - which is almost as much fun as watching them search for it. Muahaha...”*

And hilarity will ensue!

Right?

As it turns out, much less than zero.

I came in early on a Monday and placed it behind a metal poster frame hanging on the wall in the office of one of my co-workers. I flipped the ON switch and went blithely about my day, waiting for a reaction and to share a few chuckles.

Monday came and went. Nothing.

Tuesday, nothing.

Wednesday and Thursday, not a peep. At that point I figured it was broken. Frankly, I kinda forgot about it. I had Friday off and I suppose I would’ve checked it when I got back the following week.

Monday comes, lurching out of the weekend like a reanimated corpse. As soon as everyone arrives, the manager calls all 16 of us into her office for an unscheduled conference call. I end up standing at the back of the group near the office door. She dials in and our district VP announces herself through the little speaker. I stifle a yawn. The VP then introduces our company’s head of security. My brow furrows. This is unusual.

“By now,” the VP says, “some of you know about the device that was found at your branch last week.”

*Device? What the hell? What kind of device could they possibly be talking--* 

*Oh holy Jesus fuck nuggets.*

“When it was found it on Thursday nobody knew what it was, so it was brought to the branch manager, who then sent pictures of the device to me—“

*Fuck.*

“—and I forwarded the images to our head of security. He couldn’t identify it but guessed it might be a listening device so he sent the pictures to the RCMP corporate crimes division—“

*Oh fuck me.*

“—as well as the Canadian Security Intelligence Services in Ottawa. They suspected it could potentially be a bomb—“

*Fuckity grand fucking canyon of fuck.*

“—so we closed the branch, told all staff to stay home and hired a team of investigators to search every square inch of the building over the weekend for any additional devices.”

If I had sat down ahead of time to brainstorm a worst-case scenario, I wouldn’t have even come close to this epic corporate craptastrophe.
I had no choice. I took a shaky breath, steeled my nerve, clenched my ass cheeks tight and tried to say “Excuse me” but choked out a pubescent squeak instead. I cleared my throat, interrupted the conference call in that stuffy room full of my coworkers and spoke up, telling them it’s a harmless noisemaker, taking responsibility and apologizing profusely.

The room was dead quiet. The VP slowly says thank you for speaking up, they’ll stop the investigation, and the call ends. Everyone files out. I ask the manager if she wants me to stay, but she says she can’t talk to me right now. She doesn’t talk to me for three weeks. 

I found out later that she was in her car with the device on the passenger seat when she got the call that it might be a bomb. She apparently burst into tears and nearly drove into a ditch.

The district VP threw a fit and despite my 17-year unblemished work record she tried really, really hard to have me fired. Ultimately a senior executive in the company understood my benign intent and overruled her. Luckily they didn’t charge me the $50,000+ in lost business, staff wages and other miscellaneous costs.

No, I don’t know why my manager didn’t just ASK HER STAFF IF ANYONE KNEW ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF SENDING A FUCKING URGENT MEMO TO THE ENTIRE FUCKING UNIVERSE. My office is full of a lot of things but common sense isn’t one of them.

**tl;dr: ThinkGeek + corporate zombies = fail.**

**EDIT:**
So *this* is what it's like to be the bottom in an upvoted Reddit relationship. My god... it's full of *stars*. 

Some clarifications:

* I don't work for ThinkGeek. I doubt they'd be allowed to use the term ""suddenly-sodden panties"" in their attempts at viral marketing.
* My post is as accurate as I remember (it happened a few months ago). I can only relate what was told to us during the conference call about the theories about the device and the involvement of the authorities, but I can't and wont verify if that's what they actually did. I'm not going to poke that particular dog with a pointy stick.
* Although my post focuses on my frustration about the overreaction to my prank, there's a reason I posted this in TIFU after I found out this subreddit exists. 'Cause I fucked up. As I mentioned somewhere in the comment deluge below, had I given a modicum of thought to the type of risk-adverse industry I work in, I never would've placed the Annoy-a-Tron at my work at all. There would've been no overreaction to have if I hadn't done this to begin with. And my office pranking days are dead and buried - my wife will make damn sure of that. If I even *think* about trying something like this again, my wife will shove an Annoy-a-Tron so far up my ass that I'd have Daft Punk vocoder farts."
45usub,non_TBI,"For Valentine's Day, my boyfriend wanted to go to an adult store and buy some things to enhance our sex life. I, being the adventurous girlfriend that I am, was totally down for it.

Among many other items, we purchased two different butt plugs, one was a ball and one was a Christmas tree shaped plug. Both of these are not supposed to be able to be sucked up into your butt. 

Bullshit.

So, we used the Christmas tree shaped one first. He put it in and went back to having sex and I could feel him hitting the butt plug when he would thrust and it felt great, so I was like heck yea! 

Then, I didn't feel the butt plug being hit anymore. I told my boyfriend it fell out and we stopped and searched the floor, under the bed, even out into the hallway and bathroom, thinking maybe he kicked it when it fell out. We didn't find it.

We chalked it up to the room being dark and figured we would find it later.

So, he grabs the ball shaped butt plug. He attempts to put it in. The ball has a flat, circle shaped stopper that is supposed to prevent it front sliding all the way in.

I lube up the butt plug and tell my boyfriend to shove it in! Don't be shy! So he does and got way too excited. He starts screaming. I had no idea what was going on. I was screaming at him to tell me why he was screaming. He tells me the butt plug went all the way inside me. 

I start crying.

He's running around saying things like why? Oh God why? And he's apologizing.

I'm yelling at him and asking him why he did this (like he purposely did it, but I was freaking out). I am squatting on the bathroom floor trying to push this thing out of me. I have two fingers in my butt and I'm desperately trying to get a grip on it. I'm crying still. The boyfriend is asking me repeatedly if I got it out, I'm yelling at him to shut up.

Total chaos.

I pushed like I was giving birth and I finally got a grip on the ball part and pull it out.

It was foul.

I take a steaming hot shower. I am SO relieved. Beyond relieved.

My boyfriend now knows that sexy time is done. So he starts cleaning up our bedroom. I asked him to find the other butt plug, the big one. He comes into the bathroom and, very timidly, tells me he has torn the room apart, even taken the mattress off the bed frame and cannot find the butt plug. 

I knew what he was suggesting. I squatted, did an internal check, nothing.

He told me to get dressed and took me to the ER.

So, we tell everyone at the ER what's going on. One nurse says to me... My husband begs me all the time to do that and I tell him absolutely not! This is why! 

So they have me change into a gown and then the ER doc comes in. She says...  I heard the story, are you sure you searched everywhere?

We told her yes and then I told her my butt keeps clenching itself and I feel like I have to poop. She told me to try but nothing came out.

They did an x-ray and it didn't show the butt plug. The doc also did an internal exam and couldn't feel it. She said she believed it was inside of me because my butt kept clenching itself. She told me that some companies design the butt plug to show up on X-rays for this reason, but others don't and plastics and rubber and silicone may not show. 

She told my boyfriend that she hopes we had fun and are happy because I'm going to have to go into surgery. She said they were going to admit me and get me into the operating room stat. 

Dude, I was like dry heaving. I was beyond freaking out.

I all of a sudden felt like I had to poop again. The doc told me to try but not strain.

I sat on the toilet and rocked back and forth and prayed like I've never prayed before. 

I pooped.

The nurse had given me a plastic hat shaped tray to put in the toilet in case I pooped out the butt plug, but I didn't put it in the toilet. So, after I pooped, I looked in the toilet and it just looked like a huge turd. So I was bummed and figured it was just poop. 

As I'm reaching down to pull my pants up, the toilet starts to flush on its own, before I can really inspect the poop. I had to make a split second decision. Find out for sure if the butt plug was in there or let the docs go in me and find out.

I reached my bare hand into that toilet faster than I've ever been capable of moving before. Sure enough, I felt the rubbery butt plug. It was completely covered in poop.

It was the most disgusting thing ever. So now I'm carrying this giant poop covered butt plug in one hand and trying to pull up my jeans with the other and my hospital gown is falling off. I drop the butt plug into the sink, wash my hands like 5 times, get my pants on. 

I run out to the ER desk and announce that I've pooped it out. They give me gloves. I go back in and attempt to clean it off. I washed the skin off my hands. 

I went back to my ER exam room and got dressed. My boyfriend was like yes! We're leaving! I was like... I want Chinese food, now.

The doc came in and asked if I pooped and I said yep, the but plug is right there. She removes the paper towels and examines it. She was shocked by the size.

The nurse came in and I was like... I'm not trying to show off, but it's over there. She was like... By all means, show it off, I want to see.

My poop covered butt plug was on display and the whole ER staff was rushing to see it.

I felt like a superhero. 

The doc was like... You literally just saved yourself from going through surgery. 

I was like... That's how I roll.

We left the ER, got Chinese, and I gave my boyfriend head to make up for the interruption earlier.

Happy Valentines Day.

P.S. - I took a pic of the poop covered butt plug. They actually asked me if I wanted to keep it haha. My boyfriend was like ... Burn it.

3srw0o,non_TBI,"Sup pals?

The foundation to this fuck up happened about last week with the execution of it happening just a few days ago, but since it violates both the weekday rules, I had to bite my tongue and wait.

Anyways, down to brass tacks; I've been working odd hours to meet deadlines recently plus promoting a few parties for some side scratch, basically my sleep schedule has been completely fucked for the past couple months. Naturally my girlfriend, who sleeps like a normal human being for the most part, started getting a little bummed out recently on account that we are living on two different schedules. 

So, about 3 weeks ago she started trying to wake me up when she felt my 6 hour quota had been met to give us a few hours of quality time together before she went to bed. Very fair, but I'm also very deep sleeper, so she was very frustrated that she only got me out of bed a handful of times with the majority of those consisting of me roaming around the apartment like a husk with only one eye open for the first hour of consciousness. We had a talk about it, and I assured her that this wouldn't be forever, and I joked that if she really wanted to get me up maybe she should blow me into awareness. We laughed, made up, and the week pushed on. 

Fast forward to Thursday night, I'm in the strong embrace of an epic sleep, adventuring through the alternate reality that is my dreamscape when I feel this beautiful, warming sensation emanating from my loins, embracing my whole body, and I was so content, so happy, so relaxed until it was all shattered by a high pitched scream. A mixture of anger, complete horror, and utter disbelief which manifested itself into the words ""WHAT THE FUCK!"" Simultaneously, of a sudden my face is now being splashed with some luke warm mystery liquid, and a slightly warmer liquid is gently raining down everywhere. I snap awake and realize...

I just pissed in my girlfriends mouth, she spit that mouthful of piss in my face, and I'm now continuing to rain down a morning, or in this case evening wood sprinkle system-esque cascade of piss. Fuck. 

TL;DR: Asked my girlfriend to wake up with a blowjob and instead of waking up to a glorious orgasm, I filled her mouth with enough piss to make Bear Grylls flinch. 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold homie! I can't wait to tell my lady all the new reddit perks pissing in her mouth just afforded me! Perfect timing because just last night before we went out she told me I spend too much time browsing on here (I do)."
42v0lt,non_TBI,"8 days ago my girlfriend gave birth to our daughter. She had a mild infection so stayed in the special care baby unit for a few days. My girlfriend came home 3 days after the birth but we've been going back to the hospital to see our daughter every day since. Today our daughter was discharged from hospital so we went to pick her up. My girlfriend went to sign some papers in another room.

I was super anxious and if I'm honest I was not thinking straight. I ended up walking into the wrong hospital room, the one next to where my daughter was. I was a complete and utter idiot. Both hospital rooms looked exactly the same and this other baby was wearing a white babygrow and a yellow hat, just like my daughter. My daughter had a wristband, this baby didn't but I didn't realise it until later. I put the baby into the car seat and went to reception where my girlfriend was meeting me. While I was waiting, my mum showed up with some stuff for my daughter. She asked to hold the baby and I said yes. She picked her up and said ""Mike..."" I could tell by the time of her voice that something wasn't right so I started freaking out. She said the baby looked different but I insisted it was because the last time she saw her she was in an incubator.

We continued to wait and my girlfriend arrived. My girlfriend looked at the baby and her face turned white. She said that it was not her baby. We rushed over to the desk and a nurse came with us to the ward to see what had happened. There was another couple there freaking out because their baby had gone. I was forced to admit my mistake.

We picked up our daughter and headed home but now my girlfriend is being cold towards me and I feel like a crappy father for not recognising my own daughters face. Wish me luck for the next 18 years."
2z1724,non_TBI,"Posted this 3 days ago. Was removed due to rules. Reposting now that it's the weekend. Enjoy.


This did not happen today. And I'm a rebel so I don't care if you have a problem with it.


My housemate often has his girlfriend over, and she's kind of noisy during sex. Not in an annoying way; I just hear her a lot. He has apologized to me about this repeatedly. I never really get bothered by it, but a few weeks ago we had a bright idea to show her what it's like to listen to another couple have sex.


First I had him ""bring up"" with his girlfriend the fact that my girlfriend and I are into some seriously kinky shit, and it's a little bit disturbing to overhear us. Then I had my girlfriend agree to play along in the shenanigans.


So my girl comes over at night (Claire), and my housemate's girl (Jess) is already there. I hear Jess and my housemate talking softly in their room, so it was time for the show to start. My girl and I start talking a little louder than normal, and we essentially [re-enact this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lQ0-dwl7wo) (she's a great voice actress). 


Then the real fun begins. I start saying some shit like ""Yeah, spank me, spank me like a baby"" and shit. She slaps my ass really loud a few times. I can hear Jess from the other room saying ""oh my god..."" really softly. I know my housemate will keep a straight face; his acting is like kevin spacey-level. 


Claire then says some shit like ""Mmmm I always loved it when you used to fart on my neck. Will you do it again?"" and I'm like, ""I'll give it a shot, babe."" Then I just make pushing/straining sounds for about 15 seconds, then tell her I'll get to that later. Things heat up, we say a few more ridiculous phrases, I drop the obligatory South Park reference ""Oh you do that just like my father..."" etc.


But then we took it too far. Jess is in the other room obviously hypnotized by our 'activity' and she keeps whispering to my housemate, ""omg! listen! are they serious??"" and laughing and stuff.


Then I get a real bright idea, and say, ""Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby stop, stop."" Claire goes ""What?"" and I say, ""pour some of that candle wax all over my asshole."" Claire ALMOST loses it, but maintains. We remain silent for about 5 seconds. Jess is utterly silent. Then I start **shrieking** at the top of my lungs, super high-pitched, as though I'm in severe pain. I hear Jess say ""WHAT THE FUCK!!!!"" and then she and my housemate start arguing. He tries to calm her down, and tells her it was a joke, but she gets furious that we pranked her and storms out. Now they'e in a fight. And she thinks I am an asshole/psychopath.


**TL;DR: Never pour candle wax on your anus**


edit: spelling


------------------


edit 2: Jess and housemate are fine. Jess is slightly irritated/embarrassed that she got pranked, and that the pranking was a commentary on her clownish sex noises. I understand why she is not happy with me and I have apologized. Claire is overjoyed that people on Reddit think she's a keeper.


Whoever narrated, thank you.

Which is like 2 hours from now. Thanks
For the people who responded positively.

Edit2: I'm going to text her, I really don't want to make another cringey moment in my life, and have an extremely awkward phone conversation. I'll update soon.

Good night, I'll try to keep people updated if anyone is interested.

""**Pursue Hailey OP, she loves you**""

EditLastOneISwear: So sorry for the very late update, I'm drowning in school work at the moment, but here is how The coffee get-together (not date) went great. We sat around talked about old times, added each other on the newer social medias (ig, snapchat etc), and talked about past and current relationships, before you ask she's single, and before you ask I'm not interested in her. I genuinely came in thinking I was going to be, but I'm just not, and for some reason tried because I was so sure I was, but it turns out I'm not, not even slightly. She's transferring to my University next year, and we'll most likely keep in touch pretty heavily, but that's as far as it's going. I know most of you wanted a love story, but I don't know she felt like a stranger more than anything. We will definitely rebuild our friendship, and move on. My girlfriend which most of you asked about, was way more understanding than I expected, of course she was skeptical, and slightly upset, and I'm pretty much enslaved for the next month so.. theirs that. I will definitely stay with her. Above all I genuinely want to thank the people who abused the hell out of my inbox urging me to contact her. This started as a TIFU, I expected around 10 comments, and expected it to get buried in the reddits history, but it really helped me reunite with someone, and the fact it stayed up for so long is honestly amazing. Thank you so much.

This led to a mildly awkward mother-daughter conversation in which I tried to convince her that I was, in fact, a bisexual

**TL;DR I forgot it was April Fool's day 

EDIT: Wow, I left for school, came back and this blew up! Thanks for the gold and the support :) 

For those wondering,  yes Stephanie was serious.  She wanted 'April Fool's' to be her response  if I turned out to be straight.

3r38fe,non_TBI,"Please bare with me I'm going on zero hours of sleep about 20 beers and a bad hangover. Plus I'm writing this on my phone because well... My fucking house burned down with everything in it. 

Last night (Halloween), my girlfriend who I live with and myself decided to have a Halloween party, it's Saturday and we normally get fucked up on Saturday anyways so why not drink and dress up. 

We have about 15ish people over at our 2 bedroom place and about half were dressed including my girlfriend and my self. I was dressed as Mario and one of my buddy's dressed as bowzer. Well 4 of us start playing some bp to get our drink on and have a good time. We get a couple games in and the night seems like it's gonna be a good and long one. Well it was my turn up on the bp table. Myself and a good buddy of mine are on a team vs my girlfriend and bowzer. 

Before I go any further, I have a house rule that I made up to stop people from throwing air balls. If the opponent throws and over shoots the table without hitting anything you can catch it and instantly throw it and if it hits the person that air balled in the face that team has to pull a cup from their side. 

So Bowzer throws and air balls and instantly catch it and throw a fast ball as hard as I can towards his face. In his drunken stuper he ducks by throwing his ass backwards which in turn bumps the side table with 2 lit Halloween candles. The candles flew around 5 feet straight towards our curtains that my girlfriends grandmother made us. 
 
I saw everything in slow motion. It took for ever it seemed for the candles to land. My butthole puckered so fast I'm surprised it didn't whistle. Then in less than a second the entire curtain is in gulfed. 

Panic mode. I scream, he screams, my girlfriend screams, everyone screams. I rush to get anything that can hold water and start filling it up. It doesn't help my sink is over flowing with dishes already. I get one pot of water about half way filled and I can tell from the commotion from the other room that things are getting worse and the pot of water isn't going to help. I take it in the living room and way and dump it on the curtains that have already been pulled down onto the floor. It was at this point I realized that I've been living in this house for 8 months and never bought a fire extinguisher. (The house is super old and I'm an army vet so I should know better than to take a chance and not have one) we try stomping out the curtains but it had all ready reached the ceiling before they were pulled down. At that point I grabbed my dog and usher the remaining people out of the house and call 911. 

It's pouring outside, so all of us are standing out in the rain waiting on help as we watch my living room glow like a jackolanturn. Help arrived working 5 or so minutes of calling them probably about 10ish minutes from the whole thing starting. The fire fighters save the back half of the house but the living room and the dining room are fucked. 

Will update with a picture later when I head back to the house after getting some sleep. 

TL;DR Hurled a ball at Bowser, turned my house into a Jack O' Lantern. 
Thanks for the TL;DR /u/matiac "
3isoee,non_TBI,"This happened about an hour ago. I had just gotten the kids to bed and was multi-tasking by taking a piss while talking to my wife with the bathroom door open. I was distracted from the conversation when I noticed that there was a spider hanging down directly over the toilet bowl, inching closer and closer to all that I hold sacred. Naturaly, I couldnt just stop mid-stream, so I did the next best thing and tried to knock the little fucker down with my stream of pee. Unfortunately, the spider realized that I had missle lock and started to retreat back up the web, and when I tried to lead the target (that is what your are suppose to do in such situations) I missed and pissed all over the floor/wall/everywhere but in the bowl. Right about this time my wife rounds the corner into the bathroom to inqure as to why I was not responding to her inqueries as to whether or not I paid the cable bill. Of course, from her vantage she couldnt see the spider and thought that I was just pissing all over the walls for the sport of it. "
36zpo4,non_TBI,"So last night at Jimmy John's we get a call from some lady who's online order apparently didn't come through for 45 mins. We get the order as she's calling but she doesn't believe us and is all pissed off. About half an hour later we get a a prank call from some kid who asked if our blowjobs are ""freaky fast"" - 'cause that's funny, right? My coworker suggested we text the kid just to mess with him so I take her phone, get the number, type and send the message ""are your blowjobs freaky fast???!"" just to kind of mock him. It wasn't even that funny but we were bored so whatever. Then, maybe 10 minutes later we get a call from the first lady and I realize I typed the wrong number in (it was still up on our first phone screen). Apparently she was so offended even after it was explained to her that she needed to talk to our general manager the next day. I come in the next morning  and find out me, the coworker and manager are all getting fired. And it's completely my fault."
2syo1p,non_TBI,"I met a guy online, and we have been talking/snapping/texting for about two weeks. Our first date was supposed to be Friday, but he really wanted to meet me, so I agreed to meet him at his house once I got off work (at midnight.) I pull up to his house, and his mother (I wasn't aware that he lived with her) came out and told me that I shouldn't be showing up at her house to fornicate with her son in the middle of the night. As I was turning to leave, he comes out and apologizes for her behavior, and tells me that she's just looking out for him. He then says that they had had quite a few drinks. As he was explaining that she acts insane when she's drunk, not to mind her, he suddenly throws up all over me. I had to drive home covered in puke.   


EDIT: Wow, front page. I didn't realize my massive fuck up was that massive. Also, I have learned my lesson. No, I did not go to his house with even the intention of going inside. It was supposed to be talking for a bit, and then I go home. Thanks for all the concern, but I do understand how stupid of a move I made. The vomit taught me a lesson.

EDIT: Gold?! Thanks! Good to know my awful experience has made a lot of you laugh. I am laughing with you. :)"
3vdb1l,non_TBI,"So I'd been dating this girl for about 3 months, most Saturdays she would stay over but leave on the Sunday morning as Sunday was 'gaming Sundays' (I know I'm very cool) she was always pretty cool with it and didn't mind.

She stayed over, everything was normal the morning came and she left. Before I settled into my gaming session I checked Facebook first. The first thing to pop up was people wishing her happy birthday. Yep. It was her birthday and I'd sent her home so I could play video games. I've never apologised so much in my entire life.

TLDR; I wasn't aware it was my girlfriends birthday, sent her home so I could play games.

2c7srt,non_TBI,"This happened over the weekend. 

The wife and I got hitched about a month ago, but have been together for 6 years. We have been enjoying each other’s  *ahem* company quite a bit since we got married. Something about saying ‘I Do’ really got the freak juices a flowing if you catch my drift.
 
So Aunt Flow was supposed to visit last week but never showed up. That’s cool, we just got married and  then we immediately moved and didn't really get a chance for a honeymoon. Stress can delay mother nature for a few days. It has happened with her before… But then my wife got one morning and spewed all over the bathroom. As she kissed the porcelain god, a wave of panic encompassed my being.
 
I, a man child of 26 years, could possibly have spawned another human being... My entire adolescence flashed before my eyes. Visions of little league games, late nights playing Halo, Ninja Turtle themed birthday parties, and drunken college shenanigans danced around in my head. I then pictured myself sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by dirty diapers while doing taxes. *I have to be a grown up now… Fuck*.
 
So my wife is freaking out a bit, but being the amazing husband I am, I tell her to lie(lay?) down and I head up to the store and grab her a pregnancy test. I get to the local CVS and start making my way down the aisles trying to find a plastic stick for my wife to pee on. As I am looking, I pass through the toy aisle with all the goofy, crappy, cheap toys they sell at drug stores. You know, the cap guns, the bouncy balls that don’t bounce, the puzzles, that stuff. Looking over these toys I am crippled again with Nostalgasm from my youth. I remembered going up to Eckerd (before they became ‘Rite-Aid’; whatever I still call them Eckerd to this day) and begging my mom for an awesome Beast Wars Transformer to play with. I smiled as I looked at this generation’s Transformers that don’t turn into tigers and raptors, but are still pretty sweet in their own right. It was right there that I decided that I need to get in some last minute youth stuff in order to come to terms with my fate. But what on earth could make me feel like a kid again? Oh shit They have Candy.
 
Sweet, sweet Candy.
 
I merrily skipped to the Candy aisle and began perusing their selection. I was determined to buy it all. Butterfingers, Snickers, Mr. Goodbar, Goobers, Reese’s (pronounced Ree-sez, not Ree-Sees for those of you who are illiterate Dickspanks) were all cradled into my arms as I began to beam with joy. Candy fucking rocks and I’m going to eat it all and no one will tell me otherwise because I’m an adult (but I don’t want to be so I’m buying candy to feel young again). I was about to head to the checkout when I noticed a treat that I had not even thought of since I was a young lad: Fun Dip. For those who don’t know, [this is fun dip](http://imgur.com/gallery/e1kHr8L). I remember getting hopped up on that crap before my mother would dump me off at my Babysitter’s when she had to go out somewhere and couldn’t take me. Then I remembered the amazingly tasty dipping stick and how you use your own spit to scoop out the sugar from the separate pouch. I actually said “oh hell yes” out loud, grabbed 3 Fun Dip packs and made my way to the counter. After paying for the Candy and then remembering why I went there in the first place, I grabbed a pregnancy test and drove home.
 
My wife was in bed, looking sickly and pale and I rushed in with the test and showed her my grocery bag filled with delicious treats beaming with pride as if I were a child showing someone my candy haul from Halloween. She was not as amused as I was, but Doesn’t matter, have candy. I open up a Reese’s and dig in as my wife trudges to the toilet to pee. As I wait for her, I continue my newfound quest for diabeetus and stuff my face with sugary treats. I finish off my Reese’s and decide now is the time to Dip into some Fun. I grab a pack and begin to furiously suck off the candy stick in a manner that would make Jenna Haze jealous. When it is good and lubricated, I jam the stick it into the sugar to coat all the moist areas that it may come in contact with, Throw that bad boy back in my mouth and accept the sugary scratchy goodness on my tongue. Lather, Rinse, Repeat.
 
Wife comes out of the bathroom, goes towards the bed and rests the pregnancy test on her nightstand without the cap (gross woman, you just peed on that) and tells me it is time to wait. Me being the observant and attentive husband that I am, Notice something off about my wife. I ask her if everything is alright and she starts to cry. I walk over to her as she sits on our bed, put my Fun dip down, and give her a hug. She is scared. Of course she is, she’s about to grow a baby, carry it around for 9 months then force it out of her body as it splits her in half. I’d be scared too. We certainly haven’t planned for this, but we decide no matter what happens, we will keep the baby and move forward. I try to cheer her up and I offer her some Fun Dip, (because I’m an amazing and considerate husband) and we make out on the reg, so why wouldn’t she want some? She declines and sniffles, so I try and make her laugh by maintaining eye contact and reaching for the pack and saying “Are you suuuuuuuuuuure? It’s delicioussssssssss”. I then jam the stick into the sugar and plunge it into my mouth. This is where I fucked up.
 
Her eyes grow wide, and I immediately notice that this scoop of sugar tastes... off… and colder than it normally does...
 
I pull the stick out of my mouth, and to my horror, am looking at a pregnancy test covered in green sugar crystals. My mouth agape, I look at the nightstand, and see the fun dip stick, sitting by its lonesome, taunting me like the little bitch that it is, glistening from the slob job I had given it earlier. My bottom lip quivers, as a faint “no” escapes from my soul and out my mouth.
 
Cue Hysterical laughter from my wife as I scream like a 5 year old girl that just saw a spider and run to the bathroom to vomit all the sugar and chocolate that I had consumed not even 10 minutes earlier. She couldn’t stop laughing.
 
Test ended up being negative (she tried another one that wasn't ""compromised""). She went to the urgent care down the road when she wouldn't stop throwing up and it turned out she had food poisoning. She got her period later that day.
 
TL:DR: Pregnancy scare leads to quarter-life crisis, that ends with me eating pee. 

*Edited to fix the 'Cue' and to clear up the ending.

3q0oq5,non_TBI,"**The plan:** Tell a Starbucks barista that my name is Spartacus.  When my drink order arrives and the barista says ""Coffee for Spartacus?"", claim boldy that ""I'm Spartacus!"", then watch and laugh when everyone else joins with cries of ""I'm Spartacus!"".  We all have a good laugh for a couple of minutes and I'm hailed as a comic genius.

**The reality:** I told a Starbucks barista that my name was Spartacus.  When my drink order arrived the barista said ""Coffee for Spartacus?"".  I claimed boldy that I was Spartacus.  No-one else joined in with cries of ""I'm Spartacus!"".  I meekly grabbed my drink and trudged the long, long walk upstairs.  My mother, to whom I had explained the whole plan and who thought the idea was below average, went and sat at a different table.

TL;DR? I am an unfunny man.

**UPDATE** Um, thanks for all the replies.  Having collated them all in great detail in a spreadsheet, it seems that 23% of respondents would have joined in with my crap attempt at a joke, 35% of respondents want my mother's contact details because she's awesome, and 41% of people think I'm autistic and need immediate medical help.  

Have a great day everyone, and thanks to the stranger for the gold."
43vylq,non_TBI,"This actually happened today, and I'm still in the library! 

Every Tuesday and Thursday, I have 8am classes. Naturally, I'm pretty tired afterwards and sleep in my favourite library on campus for a few hours before my next lecture. 

I always set an alarm on my phone, put in some headphones, and get my snooze on. 

Today, at around 11:30, a girl randomly poked me awake and told me that my phone has constantly been ringing. 

This is when I came to the awful, embarrassing realization that for some reason, when my phone rings to wake me up, it bypasses my headphones and just rings. (Not sure it's some weird techy thing that happens with these new earbuds I'm using.) I don't realize it's ringing like this, because I sleep with my phone next to me on the desk, and expect the alarm to be pretty loud. 

Now, this wouldn't be such a big deal if my phone only rang once, maybe twice, max three times. But no, I'm an awful, snooze button lover. I had wanted to wake up at 10, but have been snoozing every 9 mins (wtf Apple??) since 10, all the way to 11:30. 

What makes it even worse, is that I've been sleeping in this library every Tuesday and Thursday, for the past month and a bit since this term started. 

Oops. I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING YOUR STUDYING. 

Edit 1: I worked till 12:15am the night before, and had to be up at 6am for my 8am. I'm usually not this bad. Have mercy on my uni student soul. 

Edit 2: I'm now aware that the 9min thing is not because of Apple, thanks ELI5 peeps! :) 

Edit 3: I'm a commuter. No dorm on campus for me! 

Edit 4: Seems like a lot of people who were there are Redditors. If you see me, please let me apologize in person! Especially if you're at that library often on those days. I usually wear a bright red jacket. (Maybe we can even be study buddies. I obviously need the motivation. I promise I won't sleep with my headphones in when we're supposed to be studying.)"
2we9lc,non_TBI,"I've always been a fan of wake and bake, this morning I packed a fat bowl and took it straight to the dome. I saw Parks and Rec was on and exclaimed ""Fuck yeah"" (I live alone)  and started it up. At some point I fell asleep and woke up to a commercial that said Exxon and Chipotle teamed up.

For some stupid reason I was pissed. Hell, Chipotle just took an item off the menu because of they way they were treating animals, how could they possibly justify teaming up with a company who is destroying the planet?!

So I wrote this to Chipotle:  ""I'm amazed with your company, you pull pork from the shelves because pigs
aren't treated properly, which is awesome!

Now you've teamed up Exxon, a company who is destroying the planet and laughing about it as they run away from their responsibilities to the environment.

 Your food is delicious, your moral compass is fucking disgusting.""

Chipotle has awesome customer service, I wrote them once before about my meal before and they wrote back within an hour, great people. Again they wrote back in about an hour, it hurt so bad to read...

""We definitely haven't partnered with Exxon. The only thing I can find online that might suggest this is a fake commercial that aired on Parks & Rec recently. Which is an awesome show as far as I'm concerned, but I'm sorry if it caused any confusion! You can read the article I found on that here: http://www.eonline.com/news/626472/parks-and-rec-can-never-leave-us-after-those-two-incredible-episodes-plus-who-played-mayor-gunderson.

Thanks for your support of our stance on the carnitas shortage!

From the Fellowship of the Foil, 
A""

My god... it still makes me feel like a complete ass hole. Fuck me I can't believe this shit just happened. The next quotes are the last two exchanges we had. 

""Wow I'm retarded, I need to stop smoking so much weed.""

""Glad to have set you straight, Alex. The next time the munchies hit, hopefully you can head for Chipotle and feel good about where your money is going. :)

Your friend in the burrito business,
A.""

If you read this A, you're awesome, thanks for setting me straight.

TLDR: I'm stupid and wrote an angry letter to Chipotle for teaming up with Exxon. At least I didn't rant about it on facebook I guess."
3rf0ug,non_TBI,"This didn't happen today, it happened about 15 years ago..but it's still stuck with me all this time.

I was about 10 years old, hanging out with my friend in my room, doing whatever it is 10 year olds do. We were listening to music when my little brother knocked on the door. Me being the mean big sister ignored him, turned the music up, and pretended like we were having a party that he couldn't come to. I imagine that made him feel crappy and he went back downstairs.

Fast forward to a few minutes later, and my mom knocks on the door, kind of angry with me. She tells me to come downstairs to see what my little brother did for me.

I go downstairs and find a clue, written by him in his little 6 year old handwriting. It lead me to another clue, and another clue. The last clue said to look in the other room for my ""Valentine"", and there he was sitting on the bed. He gave me a hug. I felt awful. Still do to this day when I think about it.

tl;dr: Ignored my 6 year old brother knocking on my bedroom door, turns out he had put a lot of work into making a Valentine's treasure hunt for me that ended with him as my ""Valentine"" and giving me a hug. Cue the awful feelings."
3eg0ek,non_TBI,"This did actually happen today, about an hour and a half ago.

I recently started working a job in a county courthouse that requires me to arrive at 8am. I typically get to the courthouse around 7:40 and, while I'd prefer to head right to my desk and get an early start on my day, due to union rules I'm not technically allowed to enter my office until 8am exactly. So typically, I stop at the courthouse coffee shop which opens at 730am. 

Side note, I HATE having coins, and this coffee shop only accepts cash. They have a cup positioned right in front of the cash register for ""take a penny, leave a penny"" purposes. So I use this very frequently, and unfortunately, I'm usually taking more than leaving. I know I know, it's bad karma but I really hate coins. They're like little subway handrails that you carry around in your pocket, it's disgusting. 

So today, I pour my coffee, walk up to the register and an greeted by a very cheery high school student with special needs. This is common as the county allows them to volunteer at the shop as a means of gaining experience to help them find a paying job. I put my coffee down and rings up the transaction. It comes to $1.06 and all I have is a $20 bill. So I reach into the cup, as I've been many mornings prior, and grab six cents to hand to her. The look on her face tells me something is wrong. She then informs me that the cup is a collection cup for donations for the special needs volunteers. As my brain is trying to process the fact that for weeks I've been blatantly helping myself to the money in this cup, right on front of plenty of the volunteers and other employees of the court house. I insist that can't be the case, as I've used it before. She then spins the cup around to show that it says ""donations for our volunteers"" The rest of the transaction is dead silent. She hands me my change which immediately dump into the donation jar and mutter a weak ""im sorry"" as I slink away. 

TL; DR TIFU by stealing donations from special needs children. 


Edit; apparently the dick move in this post is me abusing the take a penny leave a penny system. I do typically break a bill at the end of the week and dump the remaining 94 cents into the cup. so I end up giving more than I take. Just clarifying.

Also, front page is pretty neat

Edit: I worded the giving taking part wrong. I was saying I tr to put money in when I can, but I usually still take more than I give. "
46qlcv,non_TBI,"So this happened last night. I went out for a meal with some friends then went back to drink at theirs. A lot of drinking occurred. At about 2am I realised that I was pretty much unable to focus on what was going on around me so promptly got a taxi home.

Now, the fuck up. I was starving, and my incoherent brain wanted pizza, I vaguely remembered a dominos deal going on so I grab my laptop. I order a large mighty meaty, then change my mind. I change my order to a tandoori hot. Then a pepperoni passion, then a texas BBQ, then a sizzler. This went on for a while. When I finally settled on one, I sat on the sofa and went to sleep.

This morning I wake up to 7 missed calls and texts from an unknown number, and flatmates woken up by knocking at 4am. I missed the order. I'm pretty annoyed but hey its £10 right? Wrong. I ordered 8 large pizzas, thinking I was changing it each time. I then slept through the delivery and never saw the delicious pizzas.

This is quite possibly the single worst thing that has ever happened."
341v3k,non_TBI,"Well, that was awkward. Like 2 hours ago, I must have been having a bad dream or something. I woke up to the sound of knocking on the door and thought I heard crying. I rushed to the door thinking it was an emergency and it ended up being johovah's witness recruiters. 2 younger (probably around 20) girls. All I had on were my pajama pants. They continued on with their pitch as I stood there awkwardly. They gave me a packet and went on their way... AND THEN I REALIZED... My dick was just hanging out of the front door of my pajamas!

Thinking back to their opening statement... ""Is now a bad time? We can come back later""... and my response, ""Oh no! It's fine!"" and then me reaching out for the impulsive handshake at the end... What have I done?

UPDATE 3: Narration by /u/MarkReadsReddit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CHPuHmPTEg

UPDATE 2: Here's a picture of the packet thing. Some people wanted to know what they gave me. http://i.imgur.com/Bz9SY9Z.jpg

UPDATE: They ended up coming back, but this time with a guy. I apologized to them for answering the door like I did to which the guy responded, ""It happens to the best of us"". They handed me another Watchtower packet and left.

TL;DR: Answered the door to Jehovah's witness recruiters with  my dick hanging out, shook hands, realized afterwards. Check your pee hole before answering the door"
3vo7ol,non_TBI,"Okay so this morning I go into the bathroom to do my morning business.  My nephew is spending the weekend so his mother brought his stool to stand on when he brushes his teeth.  As I am sitting there trying to go, the cramps hit and I am serious pain and need to poop.  I think back about a previous post about raising your feet up off the floor helps you take a dump.  So I drag the stool over and put my feet up.  It is not particularly comfortable and I am not sure how high my feet are supposed to be.  Well mine are about 8-10"" off the ground.  All of the sudden the urge hits me and I let loose.  The hard plug followed by a severe poopsplosion.  Well, when you raise your feet that high, you also change the angle of your anus. A large part of the spray escapes the toilet painting my calves as it goes by.  I look up to see it on the floor, shower curtain and all over my legs.  It was the worst cleanup job ever, I am even gagging as I type this.  "
3nxlk4,non_TBI,"Unlike most TIFU, this one actually happened today.  

So, I'm a dentist.  There was a young early 20s new patient in the office today whose boyfriend tagged along.  At some point during the exam, the topic of Breaking Bad came up. I'm a huge fan and pretty much recommend it to anyone if I find out they haven't seen it. I know it's on Netflix so, at some point, while talking to them, I'm mentioning how good it is and I tell them they can go Netflix and chill. I've seen the phrase here a bit and on other social media.  Since Netflix has become so big, I assumed it just meant relax and watch something on Netflix and that was what the young kids were doing a lot these days. They both kind of look at each other, giggle, and mention something like they could do that. I'm not young, but I'm under 40 and I thought they just found it funny I would use a newer phrase.

Fast forward to tonight.  I'm just sitting here watching baseball when this epiphany strikes out of nowhere.  I realize there was something a little off about their reaction to my using that phrase.  So I Googled it... just to make sure.  Now I'm horrified that I told a young couple to go home and have sex. I only hope it was obvious, I didn't know what I was saying.

Edit:  I'm just glad I'm not the only one who didn't know.  Hopefully this helped others not repeat my mistake. :P"
3pdcaf,non_TBI,"Long-time lurker, first post! 
*This happened when I was but a young, dumb lad, about fourteen years ago.*

If anyone remembers what airports were like in October of 2001, then this story will make a lot more sense. Only a month after the awful 9/11 attacks, my parents decided it would be a lovely time to take a good ol' family trip to Disneyland. We left home (Canada) without any problems - airport security was immense, police presence pretty heavy - but nothing that we didn't expect. Some of the extra security was a little scary (as I was seven), but I was too excited for Disneyland to care all that much.

As expected, Disneyland was all that a little boy could want. We rode the rides, we ate the food, and most importantly, I bought a huge helium mickey-mouse shaped balloon that I *loved*. The kind of inexplicable, irreversible love that any young child develops for a new toy. Like I *really fucking loved* this balloon. 

The day after I purchased my priceless treasure, it was time to leave. Now our family was prepared for extra airport security, but we had *no idea* what was in store for us when traveling out of the US.  American security made Canadian security look like semi-retired mall cops. 

Fast-foward to the security line headed out of Anaheim. I was happily holding my beloved balloon, completely oblivious to the army of TSA officers, hi-tech security machinery, and immense police presence surrounding me. When the family in front of us began the process of opening their bags, taking off shoes, etc, my mother realized that I probably wouldn't be able to bring a giant bag of helium aboard a plane. Just before we stepped forward to get screened ourselves, she told me to dispose of the balloon. So like any smart rational seven year old, I popped it. 

Holy hell. The sound alone of the giant balloon popping sounded like a miniature explosive. All hell broke loose. People all around us started crying (yes crying, this was a month after 9/11), sirens started blaring (complete with flashing lights), and about 10 men dressed in hardcore military get-up rushed in, pointing their ~~fully automatic~~ really big and terrifying weapons at my *entire family*. Of course, we were all detained.

Four hours later we weren't on our plane, but instead were just being released from the hell that is the TSA airport-prison. After countless interviews, questions, and additional screenings, we were allowed to rebook a flight and return home that night. 

Tl;dr, popped a ballon in security shortly after the 9/11 attacks, almost got my entire family arrested / shot.

Edit: Gun fact. Not sure if they were automatic, but TSA doesn't carry automatic weaponry so thought I'd edit for improved accuracy (thanks to paxgarmana for pointing that out).

3yuzgg,non_TBI,"I've collected several prescriptions for Seretide, my preventer inhaler, but I don't use it too often so I accumulate a few in the bathroom. I always use them before a big day out. So, in preparation for NYE, I get out of the shower, deodorise, open the inhaler and take a deep blast into my lungs. 

What I didn't do was check the inhaler before I used it. Turns out a nest of baby cockroaches had moved in right on the nozzle inside the mouthpiece. I sprayed the back of my throat full of cockroaches.

29s7kp,non_TBI,"Around three months ago I applied to be an extra in the new Star Wars film. They are shooting in the UK this summer fairly close to where I am based and had put out a casting call for 'Salty Sea Dogs' (http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-7-casting-call/).

Having spent the last 6 months allowing my beard to grow out, I thought it would be a great opportunity to put my 'young Captain Birdseye' look to some actual use. So I fluffed up the facial hair, sent off some pictures of my heavily bearded face, and waited for a call from the casting agency.

Three months later and I hadn't heard anything back. By that point I thought it was fair to assume I hadn't got it. After all, every bearded man in the country had probably applied. 

So I finally got round to shaving. 

To be exact, I shaved at 1.50pm today. 

Exactly seventeen minutes later I got a text from the casting agency, specifying that I more or less had a part so long as I 'still have a good beard'.

The photos below were originally just the obligatory before/after beard selfie for Facebook. Instead they just documented one of the most badly timed shaves in history:

http://i.imgur.com/QDOVGre.jpg

Warning to all my bearded comrades: don't ever get rid of it! The universe will get you back for it.

No Star Wars for me. And I look about 15 now.



EDIT: **Update** 4th July, 11.56am (GMT)

So... I replied with 'available' and received an email this morning that laid out specifically the look they were going for (long beards/long hair). The email finished with:

*""If your hair is currently similar to this and you are generally free for filming in August on a major new feature film as an extra please email me back a 'selfie' of your current hair by the end of Friday 4th July""*

Disaster.

As much as I would have loved to send them another pre-shave photo, the honest side of me resisted the dark side and sent back an email explaining my predicament and with a photo of how the beard will look in around 6 weeks time (http://i.imgur.com/puMK7hM.jpg).

If they want me they will reply. So now I wait. And as soon as I hear back I will let you guys know.

ps - To the conspiracy theorists suggesting it's impossible for me to have shaved and showered in 8 minutes, there's this great new invention called an electric razor. You just run it over your face and the beard is gone. It's like magic!


EDIT: **Update** 11th July, 17.51pm (GMT)

As much as I wish I could deliver great news at this point, I still haven't heard back. I will send a quick followup email now, but from here it looks unlikely I will get it. Not 'salty' enough, clearly.

On the bright(ish?) side, and as some of you have pointed out, it seems that the original casting call which did the rounds online (http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-7-casting-call/) could have been mistaken about 'Salty Sea Dogs' being for Star Wars. Instead it could well be for the next Peter Pan film (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3332064/), which is shooting in Shepperton around the same time. Sadly I can't verify this as I was given very little information in my contact with them (as you'd expect).

Of course if I hear back I will post here immediately... but sorry to let you down!"
3t5njz,non_TBI,"This was a while back when my daughter was a toddler.  My husband and I didn't want her sipping on his beer so we called that Daddy's Juice.  ""No, you can't drink that it's Daddy's juice""  One day I went to pick up my daughter from daycare and her teacher saw me and started giggling.  It was around Mother's Day and she had the kids do a little project where they answered some questions about their Mommy.  How tall is Mommy?  What is Mommy's favorite color?  Including ""What is Mommy's favorite drink?"" The answer being... Daddy's Juice.  Well, that was a bit embarrassing to say the least. I explained to her what it was and we had a good laugh. "
3oka95,non_TBI,"This actually happened yesterday, so it's relatively fresh 

Right, so at the moment I am at Disney world Orlando with my dad and little sister. My sister is 10 and I am 17. As my sister is a dumbass and can't walk in a straight line as she is looking at all the Disney shenanigans, I sometimes put my hand on her back and guide her through the crowds.

Now the fuck up:
We are walking in a big crowd towards the haunted mansion and I see my sister walking the wrong way so without really paying attention I again start guiding her for a few minutes. When we get to the haunted mansion I look down and realise, that's not my sister. she was wearing similar clothes and looked similar but this was definitely not my sister. Fuck. That's also when my dad noticed. I had managed to lose my sister, and kidnap someone else's daughter at the same time.

Luckily ad Disney they are used to lost kids, petrified parents and confused siblings/ child thief's and managed to find the girls parents. And sadly, they found my sister too.

Tl:Dr went to Disney.  Saw sister. Kidnapped a little girl. 

Edit: haunted mansion not haunted house

Wow okay this has blown up, I'm glad you are all enjoying my sisters misfortunes.

3nbpto,non_TBI,"TL:DR Rock out, til the cops out.

I was driving home from work and got really into this blues song (it was on Pandora, no clue who it was).  The bass was jumping like Jacks, the guitar was singing the melodiest of melodies, the drums had a beat that just rounded it off and got me jammin'.

So I'm tapping along to the beat on my wheel until we get to a red light. Nice! It just turned red. Pushed in the clutch, stopped the truck and now I have a kick pedal (thump my right foot on the ground). The roads flat so my truck stays without my foot on the brake. 

I'm pretty much fully engulfed at this point... Then I pick up on the high hat opening ever other 4th... So here I am, lost in the fucking music at a red light and lift my left foot instinctively to raise the high hat and my truck lurches forward into the cop car. 

He gets out, checks out the car. Luckily our bumpers lined up so there was no visible damage.  But I guess he was watching me flail around and thought I was high or some shit, made me do a sobriety test etc... Then lectured me a bit and sent me on my way. Not a terrible ending, I know, but it put a damper on the fantastic mood I was in. 


Edit: Some requested things and other errors. Also I'm searching for the song.

2: the throwout bearing gets replaced when I change the clutch out, so I'm not concerned about it wearing out. I'll throw it away long before that time comes. "
3x014i,non_TBI,"Lemme see how I can start this... So every day I look forward to going to my history class, I love history. So my super chill teacher, who is really more of a role model to me than a teacher. He decided that our class has been working hard in preparation for finals, and that we should watch some show called ""The Office.""

So the open scene shows some lad talking about how bosses are like teachers, and the boss said that teachers also bang students, akin to bosses banging coworkers.

Well, I didn't quite catch that part, I'm kind of hard of hearing. I only caught the part about how bosses are like very good teachers and that some bosses are good teachers or something like that, I didn't really catch it.

Here's the fuck up; He asked me if I was enjoying the show. ""Stevie,"" he said. ""Are you enjoying this show brotha'?"" And I tried to come up with some witty comeback, and unfortunately I need to work on thinking before I say something. I said; ""Yeah! This show seems like an autobiography of your life."" And I didn't hear or realize that I said that right after the big boss guy said; ""Also teachers bang their students.""

He looked at me for one second, and said; ""Dude that's so disrespectful."" It took me a second to think and I said ""I've never seen The Office... Sorry dude... What's the show about?"" And he just said; ""Turn around, please."" In one of the most upset voices I've ever heard. I did as he said, and he was so mad that he turned off the show and said we had to read from our textbook for the rest of class.

I was very confused of why he was mad, and someone explained me the context. I felt very bad, and I went up to him and said; ""Hey, can we talk about this?"" He just told me to go and sit down. So I started writing an apology note. At the end of class, I successfully wrote a one and a half page note.

After class I said; ""Now do you want to talk about it?"" He said; ""Sure, what you said was very inappropriate and mean spirited. I was so embarrassed by what you said."" And I tried to explain to him the context in which I heard it in, but he didn't want to hear it. I gave him my apology note, and he said ""Thanks, for that, I want to talk about this on Friday."" And usually when he says he wants to talk later, I know he's going to throw some sort of detention at me.

I wanted to say more, but I choked on my tears and left. When I got home I started bawling like a baby. Not because I don't want to get in trouble, but because I had lost one my friends today.

Teacher, you told me you lurk Reddit. If you see this, I hope you can forgive me one day. I really didn't mean to imply that you're a pedophile. I know your passion is teaching, and please don't feel down...

TL;DR: Watched The Office, tried to make a witty remark, now my teacher and friend hates me.

**UPDATE**: I'm going to school now, I'll report back in a few hours.

Ok, so I decided to use Reddit's advice and just not approach him and have him approach me about it. I went in to take my exam, and he said; ""Might want to move your backback, Stevie."" And gave me a pat on the back. Also someone at my school showed this post to him, so I suppose he isn't mad at me anymore, which puts me at ease.

3w2d2h,non_TBI,"I'm sure you have all heard the story about the person yelling ""are you fucking sorry"". Well.. Today I did something similar. 

5:30pm comes around at work and I'm just chatting with a few people as we are finishing up. I then thought it might be cool if we go for a couple of beers after work. So I turned to my female colleague and went to ask her if she was game. 

However being the excellent clear speaker that I am I stumbled over my words and started saying "" do you want a quick one"" except halfways through saying quick I changed the word to sneaky. 

I ended up asking her ""do you want a quickie"".

Luckily she just laughed and told everyone else but I'm not going to live it down for a while.

EDIT: to all those asking a sneaky refers to getting a drink or two when you wouldn't usually have one. 

And I'm Australian so you don't even need to use the word beer or drink in that sentence."
3k7wqe,non_TBI,"So, I'd got pretty drunk with my girlfriend and a married couple we're friends with, and was appropriately hungover this morning. I walked my gf to work and then started to make my way home. 
My apartment is like an hour walk away from hers, and I'm starting to feel my beeriod coming on, and realise I'm not going to make it back without making a pit stop on the way.

Now, I have this thing about hating using Starbucks bathrooms without having bought anything, and I wasn't in the mood to go anywhere I had to talk to anyone. Luckily, I know the National Art Gallery is both free, and has really nice bathrooms. 

This is when the fuck-ups started. I'm *profoundly* hungover, so I don't think it's a big deal when the nearest door I find isn't the big one, and has a guard posted at it. He's busy talking to a woman so I just walked on in. I realised pretty quickly that I was in the wrong section, so tried to get to the main gallery. 

So I go downstairs and can see a part of the gallery I recognise through a glass door, and luckily there's a guy going through. I was too far away to get through with him and hate making noise too much to hail him, so I just watched the code he put in from the end of the hallway and copied it. Lo and behold, it actually worked.

I go and answer the call of nature, and decide I'm gonna have a bit of a jolly and look at some paintings. So, I'm having a great time looking at a portrait of a woman partying down with some jank-ass cherubs and shit, when I decide I'm too hungover to deal with art anymore. So, I tried to get out. 

Except I couldn't. The door was locked, and I must've set off an alarm or something when I tried to open it, because about two minutes later this giant security guard comes up behind me and says ""Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to come with me, or I'm calling the police.""

Luckily, I think he realised I wasn't an art thief by the fact I was whistling really loudly when he found me and had spent most of the time verbally mocking the paintings. Apparently the art gallery wasn't open for another half hour, which I didn't know. So I got escorted out by Big McLargehuge, and then made my way home, where obviously my first recourse was to tell reddit.

tl;dr -  Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who break into an art gallery

3q5lir,non_TBI,"This literally happened 15 mins ago, I'm still slightly traumatised. To give just a bit of background, I'm a 17 year old male, and live with my sister who is a couple years older than me, and parents of course. 
I have this strange habit that occurs subconsciously whenever I feel the need to go to the bathroom. When I'm alone, I'll casually whip out the d as I'm walking towards the bathroom, and as soon as I reach the toilet I let loose. Easy peasy, I'm in and out of there in like 10 seconds. Usually this isn't a problem, if I notice anyone around I simply do what any other civilised human being would do and not unleash my genitals. 
Today I was watching a video on my phone so I had earphones in. On my journey to the bathroom, I was giggling like a little girl so I didn't realise my sister was already sitting on the toilet as I walked in. Why the door wasn't fucking closed I will never fucking know. As I stroll in (with phone in one hand and dick in other mind you) I hear a voice say ""Sorry I'm in..."" which then cuts off. Slowly I look up from my phone. I swear if you saw her face it would be like I killed someone, though a part of her probably died so yeah. 
I got the absolute fuck out of there, and here I am in bed, watching Netflix and writing this. I'm not getting up after that traumatising experience. 
TL;DR Had to take a leak, instead showed my sister my flaccid ding dong. 
"
2l7day,non_TBI,"I'll preface this by saying that my love for hot sauce borders masochism. I often carry a bottle of Dave's Insanity Sauce or the like wherever I go. 
Redditting on my phone and about to add said sauce to my salad, I didn't bother to look up before habitually giving the bottle a good shake. I'm not sure when or how the cap on the bottle broke but as soon as I gave the first upward shake, the cap flew off, followed by a steady stream of red all over my right shoulder. Upset, I grabbed napkins and was about to clean myself off. Within seconds, the shrill screams tore through the grocery store alerting me and everyone else to the horror unfolding. 

This poor baby, who, only seconds ago, was fast asleep, had been awakened by an unnaturally spicy sauce around his eyes, nose and mouth. He had already started to rub them in an attempt to relieve the pain, exacerbating the burning. His mom grabbed napkins and ran to the sink to soak them. In desperation, I took my cold coconut water (with chunks) and proceeded to pour it on the child's face. 

15 minutes later, the ambulance showed up. A store employee had called paramedics. They took the kid and mother to the ambulance to properly care for him and probably take him to a hospital. 
At this moment of relative calm, I realize the crowd who had gathered to help had sharply focused their attention on me. It felt like the end of The Birds. I stepped carefully (with my salad and hot sauce in hand) through an eerily quiet crowd, hoping to not evoke a brutal attack. As I walked past the ambulance, I offered my card to the mother, asked her to please send me the medical bill and repeated my profuse apologies. They were not well received. 

TL;DR: Cap broke on insanely hot sauce and accidentally sprayed a stranger's baby in the face with it.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and the comforting remarks. Still no word from the mother. I don't know if that is a good thing or she's formulating a plan of attack. And yes, I definitely should have put my finger on the cap before shaking."
2g37hj,non_TBI,"I work at a small video game development studio. We recently attended a major exhibition/convention to promote our new title—a strategy game with real-time strategy and card game elements. We had a fancy booth with half a dozen computers set up and a full set of staff recruiting people, pitching to them, and showing them the game. The key ""sell"" that we were trying to make was to collect emails for a mailing list that we would use in the future for marketing, beta testing, and crowdfunding/kickstarter. Emails are the holy grail. Without them, showing off the product would be virtually worthless.

A few important things about booths at conventions/trade shows:

* There is seldom and cell phone reception because there are tens of thousands of people walking around.
* The wifi is unusably awful.
* Wired internet costs $700/day, or $2800 for the 4-day convention.

Fuck-up number 1: I had chosen to skimp out and skip getting the wired internet. Our game demo didn't require any internet connectivity.

Fuck-up number 2: All of our nice computers were being used as demo machines, and we were stuck with a Chromebook to collect the email sign-ups. Chromebooks don't work very well without internet, but I had managed to load up a Google Doc spreadsheet in ""offline mode"" to collect all of the emails. Or so I thought.

Over the course of four days, we collected hundreds of email sign-ups in the spreadsheet. Everything seemed just fine. However, when we got back to the office, the Chromebook reconnected with the internet, synced, and the entire spreadsheet was erased in an instant. Turns out that it wasn't properly set up in offline mode, so none of our edits to it were saved.

The entire product of our trip to the trade show, which required weeks of preparation and over $6500 in costs, was gone.

Edit: Yay, looks like this is actually the top /r/TIFU post that has nothing to do with sex.

Edit 2: As others have pointed out, the game is called [Prismata](http://prismata.net). I'm not sure if posting that is a violation of the rules on posting personal information; I will gladly remove the link if mods so request.

Edit 3: Thank you to everyone trying to help. We've tried just about everything. The chromebook is an HP CB2. The one thing we have not tried is scraping the hard drive, but every method I've seen for doing that seems to involve booting the device in developer mode, which apparently erases the hard drive. If anybody knows a method of actually doing this, we'll certainly give it a go.

Edit 4: Damn, now this is on top of all the sex posts.

Edit 5: Thanks to everyone who pmed me offering to sign themselves up to our list; you guys are awesome.

Edit 6: HOLY SHIT! I just checked our site stats; apparently THOUSANDS of you clicked that link above, and our list grew by more today than it otherwise has grown in the last MONTH! We added **more new emails than we lost at the exhibition**. Honestly, I have no words; you guys fucking rock.

Edit 7: WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK!!?!?! I get in this morning and our mailing list has TRIPLED. You guys have added 2x more names than the rest of our company's entire marketing efforts to date. What is this shit?

Edit 8: So apparently the r/bestof crosspost is now one of the top links on r/all; here's what you guys did to our mailing list: [http://imgur.com/EDRQhjx](http://imgur.com/EDRQhjx)

Even a few media folks contacted me about the story. The Google Docs Offline team also contacted us to try to identify the problem and possibly recover our lost data.

1i5l52,non_TBI,"Last night, I was on the bus coming home from visiting a friend in a nearby town, and I fell asleep. So I start dreaming about her, and before I know it, it turns sexual. A slow, lustrous tension builds up as, in my dream, I slowly slide my hand up her naked thigh. The second I reach her privates, all the muscles in my body release in a wonderful spasm of ecstasy.

It's enough to wake me up. Of course, with a sinking stomach, I realize instantly what is happening; My dick is happily pumping cum into my underwear like it's waving freely in an open field. Except I'm sitting in the window seat on a fully packed bus with two hours left to go, and the bathroom is out of order. To my horror, as I'm contemplating my pitiful existence, I feel the cum start to slide into the crack of my ass. There's no way to move to make it better. Water finds the fastest, most efficient route to succumb to gravity, and any way I move gets my cum deeper into my ass. 

If that wasn't bad enough, by the time I eventually got to a bathroom, it had crusted most of my ass hairs together. Pulling my cheeks apart has never been more painful - both physically and emotionally. I cried all kinds of tears last night.

TL;DR: I had a wet dream and came in my own ass."
3y11cu,non_TBI,"This all started when i was christmas shopping 2 days ago and i decided to get my parents a Christmas card, i grabbed one that said something along the lines of ""happy holidays"" and left the store. I gave my dad the card and as he reads it his eyes fill up with tears, he calls my mom near him and she starts screaming out of happiness, i was really confused as it was just a card, they suddenly say ""SO IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL I'M SO HAPPY!"" I'm really confused now and apparently i found out that the card says ""happy holidays grandma"" and my parents thought it was a way to tell them i was expecting. They're very upset now."
2r0y54,non_TBI,"So this happened to me a few days ago. 

I am heading back to Toronto after a lovely Christmas in Belize. I am in line to clear customs at the Houston airport, because for some reason you need to clear US customs even if you're transiting through to Canada.

Since the line is moving so slowly, they move all the Toronto people to another, slightly less slow-moving line. I am at the back of the line, along with a girl from South Korea. She seems very worried that she is going to miss her flight (which is going to leave in about 15 minutes). I tell her that we are on the same flight, and do my best to assure her that we're going to make it. We are indeed cutting it very close, but I try to distract her by making small talk.

Right before it is my turn to speak to the customs agent, she says to me, ""I'm sorry to ask you this, but do you mind if we go together?"" I interpret this as her asking if it is okay if we go to the gate together. It is obvious that English is not her first language, so I thought she was worried she would get lost. I reluctantly agree; even though I don't want to miss my flight, it wouldn't be right to leave someone like that. As I am walking up to the customs agent, I see her walking with me. Turns out she did not mean ""go together"" to the gate, but rather ""go together"" through customs. 

Now, you have to understand, I am a young, South Asian male in an American airport. At the time I not only had a two-week beard (didn't bother bringing a razor to Belize), but was also wearing a shemagh around my neck. I feared that once the customs agent saw through our ruse, that I would be taken to the back and cavity searched.

The agent looks at our passports, then at us. Looks at our customs forms. Back at us. Passports. Custom forms. Back at us. Finally he says, ""I'm trying to determine if y'all are married."" I reply, ""Not yet…"" and laugh nervously. After what seems like an eternity he tells us we are free to go.

We now have less than five minutes before our flight leaves. We are in Terminal A and our gate is in Terminal E. We basically sprint the entire way there and make it just as they are about to close the gate. We make it to our seats – which are coincidentally next to each other – laughing and congratulating ourselves on a job well done.

I figure that I should take this time to get to know my new fake wife-to-be. It is a three hour flight after all, and she seems cool enough. I ask her what she was doing in Belize. ""Working at the Ministry."" Wow! Like the Ministry of Finance? Or Agriculture? She must be super smart to work for the government of another country. What's more attractive than an intelligent woman?

Turns out she didn't say Ministry. She said missionary. She was working as a missionary. ""I'm a Jehovah's Witness."" she explains. After an awkward pause, she asks, ""Do you know about Jehovah's Witnesses?""

At this point I know I'm screwed. If I say no, she'll tell me about Jehovah's Witnesses. If I say yes, she'll ask me what I know, and then tell me about Jehovah's Witnesses.

Needless to say, when we reached Toronto three hours later, I regretted not leaving her at customs.

TL;DR Risked my anus (at least in my mind) to help a stranger catch her flight, ended up getting missionary for three hours.

**Edit** [Hilarious narration](http://youtu.be/bKas_GbhOMA) by /u/Cyae1 (thanks!)

3bqoqx,non_TBI,"Late Last night, Me and A few friends were walking back from a friend's house down the street. We live in an area with fairly high crime and have had property stolen on several occasions. My roommate Nick, Just in the last year, had his car broken into, and his girlfriend's car stolen from the outside our house.

So me and three friends(roommate Nick included) turn down the street that our house is on. As we are about to reach our destination, one of us notices in the distance what appears to be Nick's car backing out of our driveway. The car backs out and starts escaping heading towards us. Fueled with paranoia warranted by past experiences, we all dash towards the vehicle. As the car gets closer, sure enough it is his. My friend lunges towards his stolen vehicle and tries to open the door. In response the car accelerates, manages to maneuver around us, and speeds off into the night. We are all freaking out and cannot believe the situation that has just unfolded in front of us. The polices are called to report it. As my friend is on the phone explaining the situation to the police we get close enough to the house to find that Nick's car is still in the driveway. 

Dumbfounded we walk into the house. It turns out my other roommate who had been at home, got into a disagreement with his girlfriend. His girlfriend had called her mother to pick her up, who just so happens to have the same vehicle as my roommate Nick. From her and her Mom's perspective, four grown men came running down the middle of a dark street of a high crime area towards their car and tried to surround and steal it.

3mtm26,non_TBI,"This fuck-up happened many years ago. 

I went to my girlfriend's parents house for dinner for the first time.   Everything was going pretty good until I grabbed a bottle of salad dressing off the table and shook it up. The lid was loose, and it flew off as I was shaking the bottle. Salad dressing spewed all over the fucking dining room. It was everywhere. On the wall, on her Mom's sweater, on the chandelier, on her Dad's hair-everywhere. Everybody sat there in stunned silence, and I reacted (clearly in shock) by saying: ""Unbelievable. Not even a drop on my fucking salad.""

34n6wl,non_TBI,"Last night I was hooking up with someone for the first time. I was a little buzzed. I jacked off twice earlier in the day to last longer during sex. She gave me gum before we got to my house, my breath was minty. I was so prepared.

We started locking tongues, clothes flew off, I just punched her ticket for poundtown, choo-choo. 

I started pounding her as hard as I could, so hard the gum flew out of my mouth, I was into it, she was into it, we were in the zone.

All of a sudden I lost my boner... Too much jacking off today I presume. She asked me what's wrong, I say nothing and try to keep going. I look at her hair, gum is tangled in it. She touches it and freaks. I tell her not to panic and I go downstairs then back up with some peanut butter. It's supposed to help get gum out but it didn't work... She asked me what the fuck I'm putting in her hair. I tell her peanut butter. She tells me she hates peanut butter. Peanut butter is still not working. She tells me to get scissors. She cuts her hair out. Her hair is fucked up. She looks up and sees a framed picture of my recently deceased cat (it's a joke from my friend) and says tonight is way too fucking weird and tells me that she's leaving. She laughed in my face as she left.

I definitely fucked up my first time, but at least the gum saved me from the embarrassment of my lost erection.

3m30p8,non_TBI,"So, i work as a volunteer in a refugee camp at a danish airport (which is also a train station). Basically what we do is; we hand little bags of food to Syrian refugees on the train heading to Sweden.
Occasionally, you don't make it out of the train in time. So you have to ride the train all the way to Sweden and then back again.


So i was running through a train, when suddenly i see a group of Syrian refugees sitting and talking. Naturally i give them all of the bags i had, and told them in a very slow voice ""Here. You take this. Food"" and made eating movements with my hands. Of course, it turns out that they weren't refugees at all. They were Danish with an arabic heritage. The silence was so incredibly awkward. The train started moving and i realised that i was going to spend the next half an hour, sitting with a whole bunch of people who thought i was a giant racist.

They were so mad that two of them got out of the train with me, went all the way back to Denmark and complained. I got fired."
2af4zz,non_TBI,"So this happened a few years ago, but after reading the post about the Panera guy that derp yelled in Chipotle, it reminded me of this fuck up.

So in high school I was a lifeguard at a local outside pool club during the summer. I worked long hours between 4-6 days a week and would always leave mentally exhausted because we had a crappy management where you would be staring at the pool in one spot for hours at a time. (In training you learn that you're supposed to switch around every 15-30 minutes just to stay refreshed and aware). Anyway, one particularly long shift some kids are literally just being the worst. Breaking all the rules, running around, horseplay, all the crap you need to tell them to stop doing. As I leave, I get a call from my mom telling me to go to grocery store and pick up a few things. So I decide to just go directly from work to the store in my lifeguard attire. As I'm walking down the produce isle looking at lettuce, I see a flash of movement out of the corner of my eye and turn to see a kid full on running down the isle. My brain suddenly derps and goes back into lifeguard mode and I yell ""WALK!!!"" in the most commanding, loud voice. The kid stops like a deer in headlights and looks terrified which is pretty much what I looked like after I realized what I did. Then I look over and find the mom absolutely glaring at me exuding the most angry nonverbals I've ever seen. I'm standing there red-faced and dumbfounded and the only thing I could think to say was ""I'm a lifeguard"". I then put my head down and finished shopping as quickly as possible.

TL;DR Lifeguarded the hell out of a grocery store.

EDIT: My first Front Page post would be a TIFU haha. Thank you all for enjoying my embarrassment."
3nlu3c,non_TBI,"So yeah, this one happened 30 minutes ago.

I just... I just don't even. Wow.

So, co-worker was asking how he could manage things on his home computer from work. As the IT, he thought I'd have a clever solution. I didn't. I told him just install Teamviewer and he can access his PC from anywhere. I use it to troubleshoot VPN issues from work, file transfering issues, etc. As well as just regular use.

So he was at my desk, I didn't think twice before offering a demonstration.

Load it up. Input password. it loads, no big deal.

Loud BDSM porn.

Not mine. Who's home? My wife. What happens when teamviewer connects? Little corner icon.

After a picosecond of hardcore bondage fucking and ""Nooooo"" from this little blonde girl, I panicked and hit 'ctrl+w', which just closed the tab of bdsm porn and leaving some schoolgirl hentai shit up.

I love my wife, and I love her porn and sexuality. I think it's super hot that she loves her porn. But today was not the day.

I closed the window, and just leaned back and said, ""Well, I mean. You see it works.""

He was both shocked and amused and left with just a ""Yeah.""

That's it.

And yeah, my wife definitely would have received the ""thank you for using teamviewer"" popup. So she knows I saw. I don't think I'm going to tell her about the co-worker part.

[Edit]: Oh, wait, best part. I share office space with a few other people. After the noise one of them sort of piped up a minute later and just said, ""Uh... *""It guy""*, want to talk about something?""

Me: ""Oh, you know. Popups.""

Him: ""Uh-huh...""

3fthc9,non_TBI,"First up, this was a near fuck up, but it still makes me cringe when I think back on it (like most of my life). 
I was driving home from work late at night (part time waitress) and had my music blasting. I was really getting into the song, as always with bohemian rhapsody (fucking A+), when I notice behind me the red and blue flashing lights. I pulled over, turned the music down and thought back to everything that could have been illegal in the past 5 minutes of driving. The policeman comes over and asks if he knew why he pulled me over and although all the reddit advice on this matter says to own up, I legitimately had no clue. The  officer sighed (like a disappointed dad) then told me it's because I was using my phone, holding it and using it on loud speaker  is still illegal (where I live). Now, this is where I realised I sorta fucked up. I had to explain to the officer that I wasn't holding my phone at all and it may have looked liked it because I using my hand as a pretend microphone to sing into. He then, in all seriousness asked for a rendition of the song. I felt like my life was on the line when I nervously spat out 'I'm just a poor boy from a poor family' and he just shook his head and walked away..not sure if he was in awe or horror but I didn't get a ticket and will not be pulling out the ""microphone"" while driving again."
3ouill,non_TBI,"Hello Reddit,

Allow me to take you back to 2007 when I was a 15 year old little bastard.

Growing up, I gave my parents a lot of trouble. Started drinking in the 8th grade, started doing pills and smoking weed a year later. Anyway, I'm 15 and Halo 3 was just released. It's mid October and I had finally saved up to buy an Xbox 360. Mom gave me $60 towards the game and I go home from GameStop rather happy. Flash forward about a week later, cute older girl down the street was having a party and invited me and a couple of my buddies. It's around 11pm, parents are asleep, I sneak out of the basement like I typically do, and proceed to party. 6 or 7 beers, a couple joints, and an Oxy 3 of us split later, I am MESSED UP. Around 1am I feel my phone buzzing. This is never good. I look at my phone, it's my mom. I go to where no one can hear.. and she's furious. I tell everyone I gotta go and stumble to my house. I walk through the basement door and there stands my mother, asking me how drunk I am. I throw a few smart remarks her way, but then I hear a voice call my name from my dad's workshop. Mom NEVER gets my dad involved cuz the man's scary as all hell. I step into my father's workshop and he's got a sledgehammer in one hand and his other hand is resting gently on my Xbox. Gives me a speech about how I need to get my shit together or he's gonna smash my Xbox. To reiterate, I am MESSED UP. I look at my dad directly in the eyes, I try to look serious but I'm giggling like a school girl and manage to only say, ""NO BALLS"". Without hesitation dad lifts the hammer and Thor-smashes it. Again, and again, and again. I cried the next morning when I came to.

TL;DR: Got messed up at a party at the age of 15, got called home at 1am, dad threatens to smash Xbox, I ""no balls"" him, dad smashes Xbox, I cry next morning.

**edit 1:** To be fair, my father was **NOT** going to smash my Xbox until my drunk ass brain decided to mouth the words that would inevitably send my Xbox into eternal hell

**edit 2:** ""No balls"" is challenging someone to complete the task they've threatened to carry out by telling them they don't have the balls to do it.

**edit 3:** I turned out okay, graduated college and got a job in what I love doing and all that good stuff. Made bad decisions along the way but haven't touched a drug in years. Thanks for caring those who asked!"
41iwy1,non_TBI,"Approximately 5-6 years ago as a nerdy 12 year old I had found a small minecraft server. This server was basically about 100 people building extravagant designs. These people put a lot of work into this server, like up to hundreds of hours each.

The admins on the server were pretty trusting and gave everyone mod tools, which basically meant you had god mode and could use commands to make building easier.

I used the command which allows you to fill the volume between 2 points with a certain block. I unknowingly set one of the points at the 'spawn' and then walked diagonally for about half an hour to find a free region to build a house.

It was going to be a sky house I decided, so I built a tower to the top of the world and started with a nice pond. I wanted to surround the pond with sugar cane block, so I used the fill all command.

Here's where I fucked up. I thought I set the first point at one corner of the pond and the other at a connecting corner. Instead, the first point was still at the spawn (half hours walk away!) and the second was in my pond.

I used the fill command and filled the space with sugar cane. If I recall correctly, close to 600 million blocks of fucking sugar cane.

The thing about sugar cane is that if it's not next to water or if it's stacked above a height of 5, it drops into an item on the ground. 

I had just dropped 600 million cubic metres of sugar cane on to the ground.

Unsurprisingly the server crashed after a few minutes due to the intense load.

I found out through the servers IRC chat that the map AND the server couldn't be saved. Which means the backups couldn't be accessed, nor the chat logs, so they didn't know I did it. The admin of the server had to delete the map completely and create a new one. Needless to say, the players didn't like this one bit. The 100 players dwindled to about 10 before the server was shut down due to low interest.

Tldr: I destroyed the world by ending world hunger."
2gs02n,non_TBI,"Do I get bonus points? This happened less than an hour ago and I'm still laughing. 

I had been expecting a delivery all day, but I had to get ready for work. ""I'll grab a fast shower, what can go wrong?"" Ha. Hahaha. I was shaving my legs when I heard the doorbell ring repeatedly, and my 120-lb German Shepherd going ballistic. I knew this was a delivery I would have to sign for, so I leapt out of the shower, fumbled for my glasses, and threw on a towel. I didn't notice that I was still dripping soap at this point. (This is important later on).

I THOUGHT I locked my dog in my room as I ran to the door, but I guess the door didn't shut all the way (also important). So I opened the front door, hiding behind it to maintain some decency as I scribble and drip on the pad the poor driver offered me. Then I hear it- the dreaded sound of paws racing across hard wood. My moron dog slips in a puddle of soap, looses his footing, and crashes into the door, sending me, towel, and scribble pad flying. I landed on my ass, naked as the day I was born and sopping wet, sitting on the very same scribble pad. The poor driver got a very X-rated look at my tattooed hide as I scrambled for my missing towel (somehow it landed halfway across the room), one hand across my tits and the other trying to cover my half-shaved lady garden. I stammered an apology as he grabbed his scribble pad and practically RUNS to his truck, so red his ears might be smoking. 

My furry asshole of a dog is now watching me type this and I swear the bastard is laughing at me. Fuck my life.


Edit: holy shit! This is rapidly turning into one of my highest posts, and one of you crazy bastards popped my reddit gold cherry! Awesome :D now WTF do I do with it?

Edit edit: yup, this is now my top post AND made the front page. I love you screwballs."
2m7h3g,non_TBI,"It started out like any other Saturday, but today was Mike's 19th birthday and I wanted to do something nice for him. It was three in the afternoon and I had no gift ready and his big day was already halfway over. As I'm sitting in my dorm room and I come to the conclusion that I now am of legal age to rent a stripper. With this idea in my head, I raced down the hall and find my two close friends and I pitch my idea to them. They love it.
My next step is to ask my floor RA If there are any rules against having strippers in the on-campus dorm rooms. My RA thinks I'm kidding but he asks his supervisor anyways. After they look it up, there is no rule against strippers in the dorm rooms, so our college gave us the green light. Bingo. So how do 3 eighteen-year-old college kids find a classy stripper hours before the big day, they hit up Yellow Pages. I called some company and the operator give us a quote of $300 an hour. Now to three college kids, 300 bucks is a fuckboat of money. I said ""thank you, will keep looking"", but in the back of my head we dismiss the idea and moved on with our day.
Fast forward to 6 PM, I get a call back from the stripper company. The lady says she can do $200 for half an hour and transportation costs. Honestly, we don't care how long the stripper is here, we just want to say we got our friend a stripper for his birthday. 200 bucks split three ways is still a lot of money, so the three of us rounded up six other kids and split the cost nine ways. Mike was going to get Virginia's classiest two hour notice stripper. The operator puts me in contact with a stripper, and as soon as I start talking to this girl I realize how big of a mistake we had just made. This stripper probably drank rocks as a kid. Without any photo evidence of who she was, we told her to come and she drove 45 minutes south to our college.
I greet her when she arrives and she steps out of the car and I thought maybe she was the escort for the real stripper, but I was sadly mistaken him. Maybe this girl was a soft 2 out of 10, oh and she was 32. Looking at her, I was ready to pay her to keep her clothes on. Well we already invested the money, no turning back now.
Mike was having a really bad day, and his fraternity was having a social with a popular sorority right before the stripper was about to arrive. We planned everything out in secret so we would surprise him and we couldn't have him leaving before the big surprise. I call his big brother in the fraternity and tell him to keep Mike at bay. Now on top of Mike's terrible day, he gets a phone call saying that he is not allowed to come to tonight's social and he's in trouble. I walk the stripper from her car to my dorm room and I try my best to make small talk. How do you even make small talk with a stripper? For the three minute walk she was able to tell me about the time she was raped as a kid, how she watched her dad get shot in the face, and about her two kids in high school. Lovely.
I get to the room where all the guys are waiting and I knock on the door three times. The room erupts in chaos as nine college boys turn into rabid dogs. The stripper and I walk in and my friends faces turn from astonishment to terror. One of my good friends looks over at Mike, pats him on the back and says, ""uhhh Mike, happy birthday dude, we bought you a stripper"" and to my astonishment, he sprints over to the sink and throws up. The stripper then has an emotional breakdown and sits in my chair and starts crying. Birthday boy is up chucking his birthday wishes and the Chipotle he ate for lunch, and crazy stripper mom is hysterically crying in a chair in front of 8 now less horny boys.
After 10 minutes of dead silence from us and the stripper hysterical crying, I tell her it's okay, you can leave, we'll work something out. Having already paid her in cash, we exit the building and I bring up a refund. This is where all hell breaks loose. The stripper start screaming at me saying she does not give refunds, and threatens me with rape charges. I call the company and try to work something out, but they tell me that they have fired the stripper and they are no longer affiliated with her. I tell her if we don't get our money back I'm going to call the police.
I dial 911 on my phone but do not press the call button. What I didn't know at the time was that when you dial 911 from my phone, it automatically sends the call. The phone is not my ear, but all the dispatch officer hears is a lot of shouting over money and rape. Within 45 seconds, four police officers are running at the two of us who are standing in the middle of our quad with flashlights in our faces screaming our Maranda rights. Both of us have no idea what's going on, but now the stripper is hysterically crying again. The police officers catch her lying in between sentences when she is giving them a description of tonight's events. This stripper is so dumb she contradicts herself in every other sentence.
The next thing I know my guys come outside of our building to help tell the story and all hell breaks loose. The cops are cracking up asking why we would ever hire a stripper when we're all sober. The crazy stripper gives us her phone number, date of birth, and fake name, and goes on her way. The police officers pull us to the side, give us a hard look and one of them said ""this is why you never order a stripper off yellow pages"". So far I have received 44 calls from crazy stripper mom, and there might be a civil lawsuit involved.
TLDR: Bake your friends a fucking cake for their birthday."
44azma,non_TBI,"As I am walking out of work, I finally check my phone and see I have 4 or 5 missed calls from the same number, all within a few minutes time span. I also notice I have a text from my younger brother a few minutes before the phone calls. The phone starts ringing again, so, naturally, I answer it. Shouting and commotion-- I start to worry and am a little confused. ""Who is this? Hello? Hello!"" I tell them my name.

""Your brother has been in an accident, he's very badly hurt man. He's bleeding really bad. He said to get your number and call you."" I'm very panicked at this point, but trying to hold it together. I'm starting to put together in my mind, that text I received from my brother was probably sent while he was driving and he probably crashed. He lives in a part of the city with a lot of Mexicans, so the guy's Spanish accent checks out too, as well as the city area code. Then it get's way darker.

""I'm about to tell you something man, and I need you to listen. Your brother he's in a lot of trouble man (I'm thinking he's dying in a car crash) Your brother was texting on his phone and backed out and ran over my little nephew man! He left him in the street like a dog to died. He got scared and tried to run. I know it was a mistake but he left him like a dog. He's not breathing.""

At this point, the text I received makes more since (texting and driving), he lives next to a bunch of little Mexican kids, so it is very plausible that he was not looking and accidently did something so terrible. This guy then explains to me through tears, and screaming that they ran down my brother who was trying to run, and have beat the shit out of him. They have him back at their house and have a gun to his head. I can hear screaming and shouting in the background, one of an English speaking person through Spanish. My first instinct is, he ran over a gang member's little kid, holy shit, holy shit. I immediately ask to talk to him to make sure he's still alive and haven't hurt him too bad (they say he's bleeding, but only needs stitches at this point). My thought is that this might be the last time I talk to my brother if something goes wrong, so they put him on the phone screaming ""don't call the cops, don't call the cops!"" and all I am saying over and over is ""I love you, I love you, I'm gonna fix this, I love you."" 

This guy explains that obviously they have warrants and cant go to the cops, so I need to give them money in exchange for my brother's life. ""Are you going to do this, yes or no, tell me now or I pull the trigger!"" Of course, yes, yes, anything. I'm told if I hang up he dies, if they hear me talking to anyone else, he dies, if they hear me texting into my phone he dies. I'm told to drive to the nearest Walmart and fill out a money gram for 2000$ and send it to their relative in PR as to not have it tracked back to me. The moment they get the money they will put my brother on the phone, put him in a car and push him out at a hospital. I'm told to talk about sports as I wait in line in Walmart, and if they think something is up, they will just kill him. The entire time, this guy is switching between crying about his injured nephew, shouting at family members in the background, talking about how he is so sorry to do this to me, but they have no money and police records and they have to do it, but man to man I have his word they wont hurt my brother if I just do as they say. At that point I don't give a fuck, I am so scared to death that I will give them every dollar I have to save my brothers life, and know it needs to happen fast to get him to a hospital. 

The lady spells the name wrong on the money gram, as I am reading it back to the guy on the phone I realize. He freaks the fuck out, I run back into the Walmart still on the phone, cut in front of 10 people, and say ""You need to fix this please, now!"" And the lady looks at me like what the fuck? 

I walk back to my car as directed, and told to wait to see if it goes through. More crying and screaming in the background. I wonder if they are just taking my money and killing him anyway. They say the money didn't go through. I'm saying yes it did yes it did! ""Do you want your fucking brother to die, stop fucking around get in there and send it again!"" They put him back on the phone screaming incomprehensibly in pain. I go back in line. My card gets denied as it has hit its max. I tell them and they freak out and tell me to buy as many go cards as I can and read them the pin numbers. I do it. Another person gets on the phone ""I'm going to give the phone to your brother. He will tell you what hospital we are taking him to. How many cards did you get?"" I tell them 5, and he freaks the fuck out! We said 10! 10! I'm saying I have done everything they asked, just please let my brother go, he's got to be so fucking scared, he made a mistake, I'm so so sorry. Then the phone clicks off. 

At this point I'm in my car crying because I'm sure they've killed him. I get a text from the number saying ""We let your brother go. We got the money. God bless you."" ""Where! What hospital!"" I text back. ""He has his phone back, you can call him now."" Panicked that he's bleeding in the street somewhere, I call my brother. After a few tries, he answers ""Whatsup?"" ""Where the fuck are you? What hospital?"" ""What are you talking about, I'm at work?"" And in that moment, I have never been more emotionally fucked in my entire life. Don't let this happen to you. It was perfect, they knew I had a brother, they fed on it to get me to tell him his name-- then they perfectly executed the rest on my fear for his life. I don't know how you could live with yourself after doing this. Apparently this is not a new scam. I know, the advice is to ""just hang up,"" but when you are hearing your brother screaming in pain with a gun to his head in the background, it's just not an option. Fuck these people.

TLDR: Called by people saying my brother had run over a gang member's little kid while texting, and was being held ransom with a gun to his head. I wire them money from 3 hours away. My brother was at work the entire time.

EDIT: For clarification on two points
1) Right when I received the call and hear, ""Your brother has been in a horrible car accident,"" my first mistake was saying, ""Who, (Brothers Name)?"" But, at the time I was so panicked that I would never even have considered that someone would lie about something like that. So they used his name against me by confirming it multiple times. I know I fucked up there. I feel sick about it.

2) When I asked for them to put my brother on the phone, it lasted all of about 5 seconds. The voice was crying and yelling through some sort of gag just barely understandable saying, ""DON' CALL THE COPS DON'T CALL THE COPS."" Again, another mistake: Instead of channeling Liam Neison, I just wanted to make sure my brother knew I loved him, so the time I could have used to MAYBE realize it didn't sound like him I just spent saying ""I love you for 5 seconds, because I wanted him to know that if he really did get murdered.

This is one of those things that if you would have told me about it before hand I would have thought there's no way they could dupe me... But something about it being your brother just clouds your mind. I feel sick to my stomach I fell for it. Bank is looking into it-- doesn't sound promising. Cops have a report-- also not promising. Called Verizon-- burner phone. Called Walmart. Nothing.

The worst part: I called the number back this morning and they were still fucking using it and answered, ""why'd you hang up. Next time your brother dies."" (clearly doing this to multiple people a day) I tried to play it along so I could drive to the police station with them on the line, but eventually the guy says, ""wait. You're calling back from yesterday. FUCK YOU!"" and hangs up. 

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the feedback, suggestions, etc. To the people pointing out the ""red flags,"" especially the Puerto Rico part, my immediate response was ""why cant I just wire the money to you (Charlotte, NC--704 area code),"" and every time I would sound unsure at all about a detail ""Stop fucking asking stupid questions man or we just hang up and kill him now."" I was too scared to risk it and have that weigh on my conscience the rest of my life if I was wrong. It's the worst looking back at it now, but I'm happy to see this getting attention though, and hopefully it will save someone from having to go through this. And one of my students was in line behind me with his parents in the Walmart-- which will be a fun story on Monday. 

After a day of reflection, my biggest regret is [not handling it like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfog8WjfKyo)"
328we9,non_TBI,"This happened earlier today. I am mortified. 

A bit of background: my wife and my mother-in-law are the same height. They have the same body type. And they have the same color hair. Well today, they were wearing the same color outfit. 

Whenever my wife bends over, I always cup her ass. Not just a little tap, or on the cheek. I get down as low as I can (I have long arms) and I finger her clit if possible. Just for a second, just to tease her.

I didn't know my mother in law came over this morning. So I wake up late, see my wife for a second and give her a kiss, then I take a shower. Then I go downstairs. Go to the kitchen, cause I'm damn hungry. And by the pots, my ""wife"" is bent over, presumably getting a pan to cook with. So I proceed to cup her, and immediately proceed to the fingering her clit for a second portion.. When.. ""She"".. Yelps. 

I'm a bit horrified. But my wife just said her mom isn't mad.. But still.. Video games in my room for this week sounds great.. "

I started peeing and after a few seconds she said ""when you're done you can come to into the shower with me if you want"", and while usually I'd say yes and hop in, I felt extra funny that moment, so I replied with ""Sorry dear, my grandpa already fell for that trick""...
I really thought she'd like the joke... But she didn't..."

Last night my wife and I started getting a bit frisky after the kids were in bed. As I began to remove the items of clothing covering her magnificent breasts, she said, ""Slow down, no need for rushing!"" I replied, ""I'm not russian, I'm german!""

It took several minutes to convince her to let me touch her again."
3ay8if,non_TBI,"OK, I work behind the bar in a popular bar in Brighton, Normally I wear jeans when working but as the weather has been quite warm I opted to wear a long thin cotton skirt but unless I wore a G-string I had quite a visible panty line so I opted to go commando. The manager went down into the cellar to carry out a stock check, access to the cellar is through a trapdoor behind the bar and I carried on behind the bar. You get used to working around the open trap door and after an hour or so I had more or less forgotten that the manager was down there. I had been stood taking to a customer for a minute or 2 when I heard a discreet cough from below where I was standing. It was only then that I realised I had been stood astride the open trapdoor on full display to my boss.

His face spoke volumes as I looked down to see him grinning up at me with one hand theatrically draped over his eyes saying ""Am I clear to come up now that the rainforest has been cleared?""

The only saving grace was that he had left his i-phone by the till and did not have it with him or I suspect I would now be a lot more famous than I ever want to be.

**edit** 


1) I get it, euphemistic  references to trapdoors are now unoriginal.


2) If you are desperate for nudes send me money and I will send you someone else's nudes and we can both be happy.

3qoy7v,non_TBI,"So I lurk a lot here because I'm a pretty antisocial guy. Occasionally I will comment, and even fewer times I will post. But most of my time spent here is just reading. Across many different subs. That being said, one day I noticed that I had opened 4 or 5 threads in a row... And everyone in all of them were just complete jerks. Like unnecessarily mean to people. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. Had the urge to cuss out a few people so I just had to step away for a bit. Came back a few days later and decided to try a different sub. Same thing happens. But I really do like redditing so I decided to just not read any comments since magically, every redditor on the planet had transformed into cruel, cold hearted, tentacled beasts who only wanted to hurt others. Or maybe everyone had always been like that and they just decided to all stop faking being nice at the same time. And so I didn't read comments for probably a week. Even ignored self post comments. Just clicked links and left. Finally, just now, I click the top right of my phone and see: sort comments by: controversial. Wait...you can sort comments?

Tl;dr thought everyone in the world had become jerks for a week because my reddit comments have been sorting by controversial without my knowing"
3dsyyh,non_TBI,"I recently starting hooking up with a girl I knew from high school. We are 22 now, and just realized we were a decent match.

It was our 5th (or so) night of sleeping together, and it was great. Semi-buzzed sex ending in mutual satisfaction. As morning rolled around, we decided to have another go. Things progressed normally, foreplay went well, and eventually we ended up with her on top. As she was on top, being incredibly sexy and making me realize I had landed something special, I decided to try and assert my male dominance. Mistake.

I thought a slap on the ass would be just perfect. Not too hard, but enough to get the message across. I'm a stud. As I swing my arm out to start building momentum, she sits straight up on me. My arm moves around and I start the slight whip-like motion so that it I get a nice ""pop"" as my hand lands.

I start to make contact. My palm lands directly in the middle of her butt cheek. My fingertips, fully extended, wrap around, only to find that I've overshot the runway (so to speak). My stomach drops, and my mouth starts salivating.

I slapped my balls. Hard. With the aforementioned pop.

I let out an audible groan, and she immediately knew what I had done. She tried to get off out of courtesy, but in my state, all I could mutter was ""Don't move. Don't move.""

I sat there for the next 5 minutes, inside her, trying not to vomit (successfully) and her trying not to laugh (unsuccessfully). 

After what felt like a lifetime, I was able to allow her to get off (not the way I had hoped).

TL;DR: I tried to slap my girlfriends ass while she was in cowgirl position, and instead slapped my balls so hard I almost threw up."
3f8jcf,non_TBI,"I was browsing reddit just a bit ago and saw a tiny little spider crawling on the wall behind my monitor. I get up and destroy it with 1 smack of a peice of cardboard I found lying around.

I thought to myself ""hmmmm, if that was just a baby then there is most likely more"" 

So I look around on the wall, see nothing

I look up and right up on the ceiling above me is this huge fucking spider just staring down at me

I can't reach the ceiling with this cardboard so I grab a golf club and gently inch close enough to it so I hit it with 1 tap.

I missed

It falls down and is now behind my desk somewhere...waiting

41418e,non_TBI,"So this happened last night, me and my fiancée got engaged in November, Due to some family medical Mumbo-Jumbo we only got round to having an engagement party this evening at her mums so our parents and families could meet.

Everything was going fine, I had a few Guinness before we went to her mums and my tummy was a little gammy but I figured I'd be fine if I switched to whiskey and then I could enjoy a nice long Poop when I got home.
Now her mum is the kinda lady who believes she's the upper of the upper class, she is never not composed or proper, A few months ago she had her hip replaced and has been in a wheelchair since and is getting along fine but it was the main reason to have our engagement shindig at her place.

So everyone's being friendly and happy, begining to plan our wedding for us after a few drinks, me and the fiancée are really glad everyone gets along and the night is going great, Until her mum drops a glass of sauvignon blanc.
Me being the chivalrous fella I am leap to clean the broken glass, As I did I felt a turn in my stomach but by then I was already bent over in front of my mother in law reaching for the glass, my ass is about 15 inches from her face.
I felt the pressure first, That dull pushing sensation against my butthole, it was like time stood still, if only it had.

In a half a second I erupted in the loudest wettest fart I've ever produced, It sounded like a skeksis drowning and the warm blast of gas was soon replaced with the wet dripping sting of liquid poo running down my legs like blue jeans in a white wash.

My mother in law immediately began to throw up, I stood up quick enough to have her puke on the bottom of my new suit trousers and brown leather boots.
My fiancé went bright red, My mom and dad laughed, my sister screamed at the smell and her brothers howled with laughter and my mother in law, the poor posh woman just kept cursing through vomit and tears.
I went and cleaned up, thankfully with a change of trousers from her brother and tried to block out the noise and laughter coming from the living room and shortly after I excused myself for not feeling well.
So now I'm at home, fiancée hasnt said much and I don't think I can ever look her family in the eye again.

TL;DR - Shit myself when I bent over in front of my mother in law to clean up spilt wine.

EDIT : Front page! Holy shart! 

My fiancée ( <-with Two e's)  has now randomly read this while scrolling reddit and wants me to explain she wasn't upset with me she just wanted to make sure her mum didn't have pink eye before she laughed, having read all these comments we both think it's pretty funny although we won't be going to her mums for Sunday dinner this week. 

So its win win really. "
30hlt6,non_TBI,"Yes, I know pickles are edible entities that exist. Let me explain.

I'm in the airport with my mom, returning from Hong Kong, and we're both starving. While I find us seats in the food court, she buys two #3s from a curry place. 

The food is pretty amazing for the airport. I'm almost done chowing down, when I notice a little white cup to the side filled with chunks of a solid green vegetable. They were sliced into cubes, so I couldn't identify them at a glance, and I wasn't about to risk putting strange veggies into my mouth (especially since it was some kind of Japanese-Indian fusion food).

 ""Hey mom, what are these?""""

""Huh? Oh, those are pickles.""

""Oh, okay. I thought they might've been cucumbers.""

""Yeah, so you were right.""

""...Wait, what?""

At this point, my mom stares at me blankly. ""Yeah. They are cucumbers. Pickled cucumbers.""

Note that I love raw cucumbers and hate pickles with the passion of a thousand fiery suns. I reply in this hopelessly confused tone: ""But you said they were pickles.""

""They are pickles. Pickles are pickled cucumbers.""

Oh, so now she's just messing with me! Everybody knows pickles are a separate breed of vegetables! Like, *really? This woman tryin' to gimme the lowdown on pickles? Ha! How silly! I'll prove 'er wrong!* 

I say something along the lines of, ""You're kidding me, right? Pickles are a whole other plant. There are pickle farms, and there are cucumber farms."" She's just shaking her head, looking a little mystified, so I proceed to tell her *well they taste completely different so how can they be the same?* 

I whip out my phone to prove her wrong...

and end up feeling like an utter moron. 

I'm 110% sure the tables around us were listening in.

tl;dr: my mother no longer thinks i'm a gifted child.

1w4r0f,non_TBI,"After class the other day, I went to pick up my younger sister at the middle school. When I got there, I was shocked to see her getting beaten on by an older girl, with a few others looking on. She wasn't even fighting back. She was just curled up, covering her face.

I broke into a run and yelled for them to leave her alone. The girl who was hitting her just sort of looked at me, probably thinking I was some aftercare worker coming to shoo her away. ""She started it!"" the bully lied. Bullshit. I shoved her out of the way and checked up on my sister. She had some scrapes, but otherwise seemed okay, just shaken.

I've never seen her so scared, though. Tears were just pouring down her face. The bully girl didn't give a fuck, tried to pin the fight on her, and grabbed a fistful of her hair. Well, shit, I kinda lost control, and decked her upside the head. Her friends started screaming, and they all scampered off. I took my sister inside to get cleaned up by the nurse. She promised to let the principal know about our scuffle.

That night, our parents got a phone call. Apparently, I punched that girl so hard that her jaw dislocated, and her dad was shitting himself with rage. My parents think I did the right thing, but we could potentially be in some legal trouble. We know the bully's family has no case (multiple witnesses could identify her as the aggressor and my sister has a black eye), but they could buy a good lawyer, which is much more powerful. We'll just have to see where this goes.

So me and the wife are sitting together watching Family Feud, the question on the show is ""Name something your wife talks to you about, but you have no interest in"". The first family answered with the obvious answers, her clothes and her friends. They couldn't figure out the last two so Steve Harvey asked the second family, ""Name something your wife talks to you about, but you have no interest in"".

 "
2hz2f6,non_TBI,"Background: So I work as a Chef at a pretty popular restaurant in (city withheld).


Since September has begun we've been taking in a few students from local high schools to assist in the kitchen. It's nothing special really: washing the dishes, taking out garbage, preparing very simple ingredients. It's a pretty positive co-op program for kids who wish to get into any trade schools. This semester we've taken in three students, one of whom has Down syndrome.
Let's call the special needs kid Ricky for the story's sake. Ricky's got a strong work ethic, very positive, and to be honest seems to be more capable than the other two idiots we have working with us. I could go on a tirade about them, but this is my TIFU and not a time to get something off my chest.

Tuesday nights are nights when students are allowed to work as long as they want for more money (it's great for people who don't want to find a different job) and of course Ricky wants to stay until close. It's great for me, since with two cooks sick today the cleanup process would be forever and a day. With time winding down and the restaurant about to close, I told Ricky he could put some unused ingredients back in the walk-in freezer and take a break after he was done. A few cooks and I finished the cleanup work and we got ready to go home. I did a quick inventory of the kitchen and saw Ricky's sweater was gone so I assumed he went home. Naturally I thought nothing of it and left.

I get home, pour myself a few vodka shots (high-functioning alcoholic here, yeah sorry Mom) and read a bit before passing out in bed. About two hours ago I get a phone call and my boss is screaming at me. Ricky's parents have called the cops as well as the restaurant owner. Ricky was missing.

Of course since I was the last person to see him I was considered somewhat liable for this. My boss was having a conniption and a half by calling me every 10 minutes while I drove down to the restaurant. Ricky wasn't answering his phone and I was getting legitimately worried. I have a history of not working well with high school students, but I really liked this kid and wanted him to be safe.

I get to the restaurant to find my boss, several cops, what appeared to be Ricky's parents and... Ricky. Thank fuck he was found and my worries had come to an end... or so I thought.
It turns out Ricky interpreted my telling him to take a break after putting unused ingredients in the freezer... to take a break in the freezer. Naturally (or thankfully) he brought his sweater in with his Nintendo DS into the freezer. He didn't know how to use the emergency escape or notification (we show all the new people how to use it in the event they're trapped in a fridge or freezer) and left his phone in one of the closets. I was just so happy to see he was okay I gave him a hug. I've never felt someone so cold in my life. Surely hypothermia and pneumonia.

My woes didn't end there.

""StayChilly, you smell like bugspray.""

""What do you mean Ricky?"" 

""Your breath smells like mosquito spray.""

The cops look at me and lean in to smell the vodka shots I had a few hours prior on my breath. I'm immediately forced to take a breathalyzer test (passed) while being judged by pretty much everyone present.

It gets worse.

After I hugged Ricky he looks at my chest and, well, cold does things to people's nipples. In my haste I forgot to put on a bra and had nipplus erectus as my ex used to call it. Ricky, although innocent, loudly blurts ""Are you turned on StayChilly?"" By this point I'm so embarrassed and ashamed my face is red as can be. In one night I successfully lock a kid with Down syndrome in a freezer, forget about him, take a breathalyzer test, and forget a bra at the most inopportune time... ever.

...my boss hasn't returned any calls or texts in the hours after.
 
...coworkers are asking my recipe for ""Tard-sicles"". 

...Ricky's been at the hospital telling people he turns me on.

I'm dreading tomorrow morning.

EDIT: So work has definitely been interesting. If anyone works in a kitchen they'll know any story travels incredibly fast. The two cooks that were sick? As soon as I got in today they were singing 

*Let him go! Let him goooooo!*
*Can't freeze special-ed kids anymore!*
*Let him go! Let him goooooo!*
*Take a break and slam the door!*

People have started calling me Elsa.

It gets somewhat better I suppose. I've got several angry phone calls from Ricky's school and his parents for being so negligent. My boss has been trying to laugh it off, but at the same time he's throwing me under the bus so I can take full responsibility (which I should, I didn't check the freezer) in the event the restaurant gets blamed. I'm amazed with all the feedback, wow! 

Ricky's got mild hypothermia but is expected to recover fully. He doesn't seem too mad. 

I'll keep you all updated as the day progresses!

Edit II: So I went to the hospital to visit Ricky and drop off a large serving of our soup-of-the-day. His parents aren't talking to me and nearly sent me on my way. Ricky's brother, a redditor who saw this post on the front page, thanked me for the kind gesture and also complimented me for my terminology regarding persons with Down syndrome. I'm still scared as hell that the parents are going to take legal action.

Also thank you very much to whoever gave me gold for this post! I can't thank you guys enough!"
2rr3l6,non_TBI,"I bought the Citi Kitty toilet training system about two months ago. If you've never heard of it, it's a shallow plastic litter box that fits between the rim and seat of the toilet. It has inserts that can be removed to make a hole in the litter box. Over the course of a few months, you gradually take out all the inserts until your cat is doing his business in the toilet. 

The first week went flawlessly. Cat transitioned from his regular little box to the Citi Kitty with no problems. I decided it was time to remove the first insert. This is when I began smelling strange things in my bedroom. I soon discovered that instead of pooping in the Citi Kitty training box, my cat had been sneaking into my closet and pinching off his kitty loafs into various sneakers and boots. I thought to myself, ""Okay, he's just transitioning. He'll learn."" 

With the use of ample cat nip and praise, Cat began doing his business in the Citi Kitty training box. Victory! After a few weeks, I removed a second insert. The removal of that one insert shattered my cat's world and sent him on a downward spiral into a psychological kitty breakdown. He began to believe that everything white and porcelain was his toilet. One evening, I discovered him hunched in the bathtub, doing his best to hide behind the shower curtain. The final straw was when I went into the bathroom, looking forward to washing my face and brushing my teeth after a long day, only to discover a steaming pile of brown shame in my bathroom sink.

That was it. I couldn't take it anymore. I put the insert back in and postponed training for a month. During that month, Cat got used to doing his kitty business in the Citi Kitty litter box. All the inserts were back in, so there was no hole for him to see the toilet water below. I figured, eh why not, might as well give it another go. I removed the insert. It was a terrible mistake.

This morning, I woke up to the sound of my cat howling and moaning in pain. I rushed out of the bedroom and the smell of cat poop hit me like a brick. I searched high and low for the source of the smell. Finally... I found it. My fucking cat took a shit on my cactus. 

So, purchase the Shitty Kitty toilet training system if you enjoy cleaning poop out of your shoes, the tub, and the bathroom sink, and if you would get a kick out of seeing your cat puncture his butthole while trying to relieve himself on a cactus.

3h22u9,non_TBI,"TIFU by having my penis touched for the first time. 

I've made some edits to the story so hopefully it is easier to read. Sorry that it was poorly written before. 

---
When I was younger, I went on a lot of mission trips with my church. This takes place the summer after my 15th birthday.

We all piled into the Astrovan, 8 of us. My best friend growing up (let's call him Sam), the main female in the story (let's call her Hanna), and I took the back seats. She made herself comfortable between us in the middle of the backrow. Soon, we were all piled in, the engine sputtered to life, and we were off. The trip this year was in Ohio. It was roughly a three hour trip from home. 

Maybe fifteen minutes into the trip, Hanna brought out this massager. You may remember the type: green, four pronged, vibrating? We took turns giving each other innocent massages, but slowly, it's vibrations shook a palpable sexual tension over the back three seats of the van. It definitely was not uncommon to feel that way back then, but this was the first time I knew a female was feeling it about me, too. 

Her massage found its way to my legs. A glancing buzz to my thigh. Oddly enough, it was not just me getting the deluxe treatment. Sam as well was being given the same Genital teasing flyover. She was buzzing our towers, closer than Tom Cruise in Top Gun.  

Then, as things reached a critical crossroads, Sam passes me a note by way of his phone's notepad. ""Let her massage your dick,"" it said. I was shy, very shy, but there was nothing hesitant about the urgent fashion i pecked out the letters N-O on that T9 keyboard. My urgency and reluctance, however, had met its match in Sam's ability to manipulate simple text. As quickly as I had typed no, he changed it to yes and ""accidentally"" let Hanna see. 

Now, one thing we can all agree on, is a young, inexperienced male in the heat of puberty can be seduced by nothing more than a breeze. I was no different. Moments later, her hand had slid up my gym shorts and her hands began to explore my crotch. I positioned a blanket over my lap and more or less gave her free reign of my undercarriage. Now, despite my lifelong anticipation for what was now happening, it was accompanied by a sudden, saddening realization that she had not developed the same deft stroke that I had grown accustomed. I was the opposite of ""enjoying it"", but had enough worldly awareness to realize what was happening was too rare for me to reject. The setting wasn't great, Her technique was worse, but I hope that you all will understand why I felt obligated to try my best to appreciate my circumstances. 

Fast-forward AN HOUR. Imagine all the ways Cosmopolitan had steered this poor girl wrong, and sympathize with me. I was paying the price of years of poorly researched techniques in somehow trustable printed ink. The fact that this treasonous act was still being performed on my royal jewels that long after should be evidence enough of her lack of prowess. There was a lot of squeezing and tugging, not things I would ordinarily associate with enjoyment in those regions. 

After a little more than an hour total, The Astrovan stopped for lunch. As did the other vehicles. It was a great but only temporary reprieve. Sam had a PB&J sandwich and a laugh at my suffering. I don't remember having much of an appetite. 

Now let me remind you at this junction that we were on a mission trip, through our church, with my church's youth group. The mission trip was to last 5 days. We'd brought sleeping bags, pillows, and blankets so we'd be comfortable sleeping on the floor of a community center gymnasium. Okay. Got it? Now let's continue. 

My reprieve, as I stated before, was only temporary. When we were back on the road, Sam and I flipped our places in the back of the van, presumably to give Her other arm a rest. Almost immediately, It began again. I pulled my hat over my eyes, faking sleep, but the rise and fall of my blanket in my lap proved my restlessness. Some THIRTY MINUTES later, something happened. Something that gave me reasonable cause to write in to Cosmo's Complaint Department and file a full-fledged grievance. The basketball shorts I was wearing hardly provided barrier to my more ""protected"" assets. Her hand, being slid up my shorts, was right there...Some guys like fingers in their rectum, I get that, but that section of the article should've been prefaced with adequate prerequisite stipulations. 1) never in a van, 2) never while with your church group 3) never suddenly, aggressively, or 4) while wearing sharp gel nails. Fuck, man. 

This entire time, Sam is very aware of my displeasure. I think he may of giggled, just then. 

Fast forward FIVE MORE MINUTES. Sam, somehow still thoroughly entertained, in a merciful act of triage, gives Her some much needed pointers. ""Pointers"" of a completely different variety, if you catch my drift. I think he gestured to her the proper technique because suddenly things got a lot more focused in a great way. 

Suddenly, it become pleasurable. The pleasure grows. Finally, in much the fashion you'd expect of someone in my situation, I was not far from relief. This is where I unintentionally manufactured my revenge on this penal penile perpetrator. I lifted the blanket off my crotch as I orgasmed, exposing my cock and creating an uncertainty as where the explosion would go. Her reaction, perhaps also from lack of real-life experience, was to raise a shield to protect herself from what I can only guess she assumed would be enormous, and deadly. And actually, to my surprise as much as hers, it was. It absolutely devastated her shield. Which was her pillow. The one that she would be sleeping on for the next five nights...

She made a sound then. Not a grunt, or a scream. Not a sound that has a name. For the sake of building it with your imagination, let's call it the ""someone jizzed EVERYWHERE"" sound. Fleeting innocence, utter shock, sadness, fury, all boiled down into one cacophonous squeal. 

We haven't spoken since.

TLDR: My first handjob lasted two hours. Got a finger in my butt. Finally came on the pillow the girl was going to need for the next week. "
2tjnek,non_TBI,"TIFU by accidentally getting my cleaning lady high as fuck

So yesterday, I had a friend that was going to come over to play some Mario Kart in the afternoon.  The problem was, I had told my cleaning lady, an older Hispanic lady in her 60s, to come over at 3PM and she likes to have the place to herself when she cleans, which meant that either I had to tell her or my friend to come earlier.  I messaged Maria and she agreed to come earlier at 11AM which would coincide well with a lunch meeting I had to be at. I gave her the normal $100 plus an extra $20 for being willing to come early and not giving me a hard time and then left the house, figuring she'd be gone by the time I got back.

I pull into my parking spot and see that her car is still there.  Hmmm, that's strange.  Wonder what took so long?  My place is not that big and she did say she had extra energy today which sounded to me like she thought she'd be finished by the time I got home.  

As I open the door I can see the place is almost finished.  Pretty nice job as usual, Maria!  But then she looks at me with terror in her eyes.  She says, ""I ate the chocolate.""  

You wot, m8?  

She says she ate the chocolate and now feels…kinda weird.  Kinda tired.  I said OMG Maria, you ate the wrong chocolate!  She ate an entire Strawberry Wafflecone Zenbar THC-infused edible!  This was a freebie from a dispensary I got a couple months ago that I left lying around because I didn't want to fuck with it because it didn't say how much THC was in it.  Anybody who's tried edibles before knows that you can easily eat way more than you need to and thus, it's better to err on the side of caution and dose small at first.

Maria asks me if she's gonna die.  I think about it for a second and remember that nobody in the history of planet earth has ingested so much THC that they died from it.  However, with my luck, this could easily be the first case in history of that happening.  

I laughed and told her, No Maria you're not gonna die, but you might have a bad trip.  I tell her that it was marijuana in the chocolate and asked how long ago she ate it.  She said 30 minutes so I suggested she throw it up so as to save herself from letting it digest further.  She tried, but to no avail.

I said well Maria, you can chill here until it wears off, you're certainly in no shape to drive.  She begrudgingly agreed and thus began probably the worst trip she's ever had in her life.  This poor lady sat on my couch trying not to die for the next 7 hours.

I searched the interwebs for any information I could find about how much THC was in this bad boy since there was none on the wrapper.  Turns out there's 120mg of THC aka 1.2 grams.  The chocolate bar was sectioned off in 12, meaning she ate 12x a regular dose!!

Then I start searching for anything I can find about what to do when someone's eaten more weed than they should have and the best I can come up with is one post on erowid about how milk and cookies can help sober you up.

My friend agrees to bring milk and cookies and finds Maria on my couch all bundled up in a blanket.  

I tried to sit with her and keep her company, but she wasn't having it.  Tried to turn on the TV or put some music on, wasn't having it.  She told me not to look at her and to ""not call any mens (SIC)"" which I believe meant that she felt like someone might take advantage of her in her vulnerable state.  Clearly the paranoia has set in.  

Anyways, my friend shows up with the milk and cookies and she agrees to eat one and drink a little milk. 

We play Mario Kart in the other room and check on her every now and then between races.  A couple hours pass, the sun has gone down, she's now 4 hours into the ride of her life when we check on her.  

""I ate all the cookies.""  

We laugh our asses off and tell her that that was what they were for and she begins to look a little relieved.  Slowly over the next couple hours, she starts to look less terrified and actually a little refreshed.  My friend leaves to go to dinner with her girlfriends and I make plans to go out as well, telling Maria that I have to leave at 9:30 but that she's more than welcome to stay until she's cool to drive.  

She says my place is scary at night by herself so she's going to sleep in the car if that's ok.  I say sure that's fine, go ahead and that I'd be back to check on her when I got home, but that if she went home to please text me that she made it back.

10:30 rolls around and I'm in the club telling the story to my boys when I get the message:

""I got home thank God!""

PHEW!  Our collective nightmare is over and order has been restored.  But I don't think she will ever ever ever ever eat anything in my house ever again.  

The irony was that if she'd only been a little less picky in her chocolate choices, she woulda been fine.  I'd recently come back to Canada with a huge dark chocolate bar that was easily 3x the size of the edible but she didn't eat that one which was plainly in sight.  Nope, she went for what she thought was the one I'd forgotten about and karma was an instant bitch yesterday.  

Now the only question is: should I call her back to clean next month?

TLDR; My cleaning lady ate an entire fucking edible and spent the afternoon high out of her mind on my couch.

Here are some replies to frequent comments:

- I hadn't seen the Al Madrigal bit until now but that shit is hella funny.  I can 100% assure you that this really did happen on Friday.
- I did offer to drive her home early in the afternoon and my friend certainly woulda followed in her car but she wasn't having it because her family was at home and she was freaking out.
- By the time 9:30 rolled around she was definitely down from a [10] to a [3] and looked visibly refreshed.  My parking garage is underground and gated/covered so she was in no danger to chill down there for a bit.  Based on when I got the text message and when I left, she chilled for half an hour and bounced.
- Turns out 120mg is only .12 grams, not 1.2 so PHEW!  Thank God my metric math sucks!!  She'd prolly still be trippin' if it were more!
- For the record I didn't take the photo, my friend did.  She was like ""LET'S TAKE A PICTURE!!"" and I said no, but she did it when I was in the other room anyways.  When she showed me at the club (her and her friends showed up later and also thought it was hilarious), I fuckin' died and decided to post it.  Hey at least I blurred her face.

3ysac8,non_TBI,"This happened late yesterday afternoon, and I'm still trying to deal with the aftermath!

Since Sept of 2013, I've lost about 30 pounds, which has been really great, but it came back to bite me yesterday. It bit HARD.

After my wife was done with work yesterday afternoon, she thought it would be a good idea for our two boys to play in the 6 or 7 inches of snow that had fallen overnight. So we bundled up the kiddos, grabbed the saucer and went out in our backyard to slide down the little hill. Since the kids are 1 and 3, this little grade is perfect for them to sled down.

Being dad, I had to take a few runs myself, just to see what it was like. It was good, but it could be bit longer, so I decided to go down a different way and make a new path.

I ran. I jumped on the saucer. I went down the hill and fell off, getting powder all over me, in my boots, up my pants, and in my gloves. Quickly I pulled my glove off of my left hand and shook the snow off. That's when I felt it go. It felt like eternity, but there was nothing I could do in that split second. 

My white gold wedding band went flying off my finger and landed somewhere in the snow.

After losing the weight, my ring has been really loose, loose enough to come off while shaking my hand!

I have no idea where it is. My attempts at raking the snow were futile last night. My finger feels weird without it, and my wife thinks I'm a complete nimrod.

YIFU.

TL;DR: lost weight, went sledding. Got snow in my gloves and flung my loose wedding band into 6 or 7 inches of fresh powdered snow."

I call some girls too, and, by the beggining of the party, there was 7 people: /u/hank_moo_d, **Joe**, **GUY1**, **GUY2**, **GIRL1**, **GIRL2** and **GIRL3**.  
We started drinking, and talking, and people just spread around in the house. Some were in the balcony (it was a apartment), some in the bedroom, some in the living room. After a while, i heard a scream, and one of the girls leaves the bedroom, covered only by the bed sheets. wtf!?  
Everybody left the apartment, because the mood got heavy.  
I was driving home, me and my friend, so i ask him: ""Joe, what happened?"". Here it goes:  
>**Joe**: Yeah... So, i was in the bedroom with **GUY1** and **GIRL1**. We were chatting, no big deal. All of a sudden, **GUY2** enters the room with **GIRL2**. They were hooking up, so the three of us decided to leave the bedroom so they could use it. As we leave, i turned off the lights, and realized the room got pitch black. So, i decided to stay inside, since they wouldn't see me. I closed the door and stayed by the wall. They started heating up on the bed, as i could hear. Given time, your sight starts to get used to the dark. So i could see forms and shapes. I could see them fucking. I started to jacking off. The girl was on four, and basically i was in her eyesight direction, but she did not see me. The guy was fucking her really hard, and i started to jack off even harder, and then... she sees me. She screams, saying *theres somebody there*. So i started apologizing, and turned on the lights. As they see me, and i see them now, in the light, we all turn to another corner of the bedroom: there was **GUY1** there, dick in hand. He started to apologize as well, then she leaves the room screaming.""  
  
**TL;DR:** Invited a horny friend to a house party. He sneaked in a bedroom with couple fucking in it. They see him after a while. Then, they realize there was a even more ninja guy in another corner as well.  
**The tale of the horny ninjas**  
**EDIT:** Since 3 guys were in the bedroom, me and the other 2 girls just thought the Ninja Jerkers were buying cigarretes at the gas station down the street. This all happened in the timeframe of 5 minutes (or less).  
**EDIT²:** All the girls were ours friends, so they just laughed about it afterwards. The only new face to them was the second ninja. He was friend of the guy who got ninja-cockblocked.  
**EDIT³:** A lot of people are calling it fake. I don't mind, but i'll try to answer some questions people are making.  
**1) Didn't GIRL1 notice why she left the bedroom alone?** *I sent her a message about that. She said she went straight to the bathroom. When she left the bathroom, she didn't even think about JOE and GUY1.*  
**2) How they didn't notice the second ninja fapper?** *That's the beauty. Nobody knows.*  
**3) Who was the host?** *The guy who got ninja-cockblocked.*"
3c7ida,non_TBI,"As many have asked, here is the not very long awaited ending the the van, the xbox and the tickets. 

Trial was on Friday. Not so much trial as it is just to go down to the court house and see if the crown would consider dropping charges or decreasing the size of the fines. It had been asked lots of times, so the ticket breakdown was 250$ for no registration, 250$ for operating a motor vehicle with and improper license and 2500$ for having no insurance. 

I got to the court house and sat down in the chambers. There were quite a few other people there. It made me feel a lot more comfortable when there are 3 or 4 people being called ahead of me, being charged with theft, attempted murder, etc etc. it's interesting that they have traffic violators and violent offenders at the same place. Small town thing I guess. My name was called, I walked up to the cue. The judge asked me if I would like to speak to duty council. I had never been to a court house in my life and being that I was representing myself, any sort of help seemed reasonable. I agreed and an older gentlemen walked me out of the chamber and into his tiny little office. 

I don't know how or why, but this man was my saving grace. He sits me down and says 'ok, I can likely drop the insurance ticket, just pay the other 2.' So 500$ instead of 3000$ sounds pretty awesome. So he and I walk back I to chambers and I'm called again. This time, the old man stands at the cue for me and asks the judge to drop the one charge. I had never been in trouble before, so the judge looked at my record, turned to me and said 'this the last time I see you?' I reply with a yes ma'am and that was that. Ordered to pay the other 2 fines and my insurance one was dropped. Walked out, did a little thriller dance off with myself and that was that. 

So here I am. I'm not dead. The van is now gone unfortunately. The impound lot held it for a few days now and it racked up an insane amount so we just told em to keep it. Haven't heard from buddy with the Xbox. That's ok. I may have no xbox, no van and not much a social life currently, but I'm alive and I didn't ruin my life for a few days of fun. 

So learn from me and don't be fucking dumb. 

TL;dr got 2 tickets instead of 3 and came out slightly less retarded. "

26f15x,non_TBI,"Today I fucked up because anonymous sex. 

Craigslist is typically a failure, but I've had enough success that I still go back to it now and then. About a month ago I answered an ad for a couple where the husband was going to tie up his wife so I could use her, free to cum where I wanted to. We ended up not meeting, but there had been good contact. 

So yesterday I was responding to craigslist ads, hoping for the best, when I saw the same couple posting. I responded, we chatted a bit and they asked me to come by this morning. 

Bright and early (and horny) I woke up, and started emailing then right away. Apparently they were equally excited and were responding immediately. 

Anyway, about two or three hours later I show up to the house and am greeted by the husband. We talk for a minute as he makes sure I'm safe and I make sure there isn't a hidden axe next to a stack of plastic trash bags. There weren't, and apparently I don't come across as crazy.

Ground rules were: no hurting her, no anal, she stays blindfolded, cum ANYWHERE except in her pussy, and I have to be ok with him jerking off and watching. Deal.

So I went into the room designated, which looked like a tv room. She was blindfolded and tied to an armour thing. I didn't look around too much, but all pictures and stuff were covered or laid down. 

I fucked her from behind like crazy, her husband jerked off. While I was fucking her, I noticed a tattoo of a star on her shoulder but thought nothing of it. I fucked her like that for about 10 minutes and she was groaning heavily. Eventually he got in front of her and she gave him head while I kept fucking. Shortly after, it was time to cum and I shot it all up her back, even onto her shoulder tattoo. 

Exhausted and hot, I stood there for a moment watching her blow him until I began to feel awkward. I backed up slowly and started putting my clothes back on, and neither of them seemed to notice. I asked if I could grab a drink before I left, and he told me to grab a water bottle off the kitchen table and promptly forgot about me. 

I walked into the kitchen and grabbed the water bottle when I noticed a picture on the fridge - EXACTLY the same picture on my fridge, of my grandma holding my cousins baby (both my grandma and my cousins baby died within a week of eachother from individual natural causes, it was very traumatic for my entire family).

Immediately I went to my car and tried to figure out wtf happened. After about half an hour on Facebook, I found an aunt of mine at a wedding with the husband of the woman I had just fucked. A few clicks around his profile and I saw the picture of MY COUSIN getting a star tattoo. I had not even known she got married, or that she lived in this state again. Hell, I hadn't seen her since we were kids and she had all but become forgotten. 

So that's out, and I guess I'm the only one who knows as long as I continue to avoid family events.

Update: My cousin is a redditor, and now her husband wants to kick my ass? So I'm just gonna stop here and go to sleep while I contemplate whether or not to sleep with a machete. Good night reddit, thanks for helping me feel better. Or shittier. I guess it depends how you look at it. 

To my cousin and her husband: I'm sorry you read this, I didn't think you would, I just assumed it would disappear into the internet. Read what I said please, nothing was disrespectful, and I really did have a good time with you.. this post was not about anything negative, and I swear I will NEVER mention this to anyone ever again. Really, I'm sorry. "
37yl7o,non_TBI,"First off this happened yesterday but I was a bit injured so I couldn't write this. Anyways let's just get right to it. 

So every morning as I get ready for school I shower because personal hygiene is a good thing. This particular morning I was a bit sluggish so I was getting clumsy. I went to take my underwear off and the big toe on my right foot got caught in my underwear and I fell over head first into the door. The next thing I know I am butt ass naked laying in my bathroom with my mom on the phone with 911. She is freaking the fuck out and I quote, ""HE IS NAKED ON THE GROUND UNCONSCIOUS! I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED JUST PLEASE COME!"" So the ambulance comes and wind up going to the Emergency Room in just my underwear. Now I am being tested for a concussion. 

TL;DR: My underwear tried to kill me. 

Edit: Holy shit just got back from going out and this blew up. Also there was no injury I was just a bit banged up. 

Edit 2: For clarification, I was not going to school but showering to keep clean. Sorry for confusion. I know yesterday was Saturday, I forgot since my head is jumbled up. "
2y4w1u,non_TBI,"I'm just getting home now and want to share this pretty mild but utterly stupid fuckup with you.

On my way over here I drove up to a red traffic light. Since I wanted to make a right turn, I lined up in the rightmost lane behind 4 or 5 cars.

As the light goes green and nobody moves, I begin to boil a little. Although I'm pretty sure everybody zones out and starts daydreaming in traffic at least once in his life, I can't stand if that happens in front of me and costs me precious seconds I could spend doing things I like better than waiting.

And as much as I hate this, I love to put people in their place for it. So obviously I made sure absolutely everybody around me got to hear my horn and the pretty admirable tirade of only the finest slurs and insults my vocabulary has to offer.

A few seconds later, when still nothing happened, it hit me: the cars in front of me were parked -.-"
3t9qos,non_TBI,"So basically cheque came and I was super happy , so I wanted to tell my mom about it.

Which in hindsight is where is my first fuck up is because my 50+ year old Somali mom thinks that any making money on the internet is secretly a scam to steal all of our personal information (Run by the Jamaicans) .

Realizing that I fucked up by even mentioning money and internet in the same sentence , I attempted calmly walk away before she got curious. 

She got curious. 

I immediately responded with ""Hooyo(mom) you are going to misinterpret what I'm going to say and we are gonna have a stupid argument""

She chuckles and responds with ""Im not that much of an immigrant""

So I gave her the benefit of the doubt and explained I signed up with a network a few months back and did all the paperwork on my own (since I just turned 18). She was cool with it at first and asked how ad revenue works , I explained its based on how many people watch.

She asked if anyone in our neighbourhood(shitty) could watch it , I just said ""Its open for everyone to see and that yeah **someone I know could see it** "". 

Noticing she is getting a bit upset , I tried to end the conversation. 

*Side Note* : My mom kept me inside alot as a kid because she assumed the kids in my area were a bad influence and even at 18 them watching me tell jokes online was a huge nono that could lead to be selling drugs. (actual thing she said)

But again she calmed down and asked about the paperwork when I signed up for my network. Knowing that if I bailed now she'll assume the worst and I'd be fucked , I told he about how filled out a W8 form (cause Im in Canada)  for the IRS using **my SIN ** and some other things along those lines. 

I'm screaming internally waiting for the oncoming storm but she replies with ""So is there a limit to how much you make ?"" and said ""Nope , just depends if enough people watch. **Think of it like Commission** ""

Im fucking amazed that my mom is actually believing in me instead of making up the usual batshit insane tinhat theory of crime and identity theft.


But I was wrong , *she just felt a little slow about it today*

#SO

So the the three magic nails in my coffin appear "" **someone I know could see it** ""  , "" **my SIN ** "" and the fucking stupidest one "" **Think of it like Commission** ""

"" *I see it now *  The people in our neighbourhood told you could make money online with dumb videos but they really just wanted your SIN so they could steal your identity and make money off your work so they told it was commission so you'd be okay with getting such a low amount.""

At this point I've given up hope BUT! We had to pray so that bought me some few moments of peace before what I was expecting to be a beating.

But Nope , no beating instead I came upstairs to my computer/mic/monitor being thrown downstairs all while hearing my Mom wail ""YOU RUINED OUR LIVES YOU SOLD ALL OF ID"" ""YOU SO STUPID HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE IT"" ""HOW COULD AN IDIOT THAT CAN BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO BADLY BE MY SON"" and worst part was I knew she was so mad that anything I will be misinterpreted so i took my computer into my room (because mic and monitor are fucked now)
and checked if it worked.

I took our old kind of broken TV from the basement and tried to use it as a monitor to see if the comp worked , I got a black screen at first but then realized that only my GPU broke (RIP my shitty Radeon 7800 ,you served me well :'c ).

So currently in my room with the door locked with a now worse computer and no mic. So also RIP my Youtube channel.

**TL;DR** Immigrant Mom saves child from Gambling Let's Play slave ring by destroying his mic monitor and Graphics card.

3yfecf,non_TBI,"BACKGROUND: This happened two hours ago and I'm still embarrassed.  For those of you who don't know, Michael's is a craft store with EVERYTHING.  I'm an 18 year old girl in college and I happen to have a boyfriend.  Parents like said boyfriend, blah blah blah.  

Now onto the story...
My mom was excited because Michael's was having a 70% off Christmas sale and a lot of other things were marked down too.  I live in a dorm room so I went to check out baskets (oh sweet storage space).  After examining several that were cute but still out of my price range, I found a grey wicker basket with a white canvas lining.  It fit perfectly with my color scheme and I was psyched to see the price, after the discount, was $7.  I touched it and said ""I like this one"" and then turned to my mom to ask if I could get it.  
Her jaw had gone slack and tears welled up in her eyes.  ""But you're so young,"" she said.  Confused, I looked at the basket and realised the front had ""Baby Things"" embroidered in French script.  For some reason, I thought the response, ""Oh no, I'm not pregnant yet,"" was the perfect response.  My dad, an aisle over, said ""What the fuck"" and everyone immediately looked in our vicinity.  
After a few moments of mortal terror, I convinced my parents that, no, I was not pregnant and yes, I was telling the truth.  After my mom calmed down, we immediately checked out and left.  In the car they asked if I was using condoms.  Good times.  And I didn't even get a basket.

TL;DR fucked up by making my mom cry in a crafts store by telling her I was pregnant but not really

EDIT: fixed a typo

EDIT2: thanks for the gold! :D

34hfzy,non_TBI,"He always shakes everything out before he puts it on, no matter where he got it from -- floor, closet, drawer. He inspects his clothing thoroughly and also usually folds things neatly even when they're dirty. And usually, if anything's been on the floor, as long as he doesn't need it immediately, he'll automatically toss it into the laundry, even if he knows it's clean. At any given time, his clothes make up a good 70% of the clothes I wash and he rarely touches something that's been deemed 'dirty.' I always thought he was being a lazy weirdo, but now I know the truth.

Because as soon as I slipped my arm in the sleeve of my robe today (which I took directly off its designated hook), a huge [house centipede](http://imgur.com/a7jvQda) skittered out over my hand and fell on the floor. It was so big that it made a *sound* when it landed. It is now setting up camp under our bed. 

I feel so violated and the worst part is I had just finished showering and there is no way there's enough hot water left to wash away the feeling of its skittery little legs. I can't even trust clean clothes that have been put away!

Boyfriend's response: And now you know why.

Edit: No sign of the beast for now. Oh, and as many have pointed out, despite looking like little creepy aliens, house centipedes are good to have around. I just prefer them to not be in my clothes or on my person. Also, I live in Canada, in Quebec, for everybody asking. "
2x4d6e,non_TBI,"TIFU by cussing out a telemarketer.

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

As is often the case when I hear that *particular* ringtone for unknown numbers I pause to consider what I might possibly say to whomever I discover on the other end.  Typically I will be greeted with utter silence or the tell-tale click of a robo-dialer dropping the call, but I always steel myself for the possibility of genuine human speech uttered in response to my...

• Me: ""Hello?""

• Phone: ""***DO YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY FROM HOME?!?!?!  MORE MONEY THAN YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IN YOUR ___LIFE___?!?!??!?!***""

Dammit.  It's a recorded message, and it was LOUD.  Those aren't nearly as fun because you don't get to cuss anyone.  For the most part I have learned that the only way to stop them from calling back is to wait until they finish their speech and get to the part where you can...

• Phone: ""***PRESS 1 FOR MORE INFORMATION!!!!!***  (or press 9 to be removed from our list)""

• Me: Presses 9.

• Phone: ""***THANK YOU FOR SIGNING UP!***  Someone will be calling you real soon!""

• Me: ""You son of a bitch.""

• Phone: ""*click*""

It takes a lot to piss me off.  It really does!  There's very few things that make me want to punch faces in this world and this sort of thing ranks right up there... ~~just above sloths.~~  This put me in mind of that ol' classic ""Cat Facts"" prank.  Still, maybe they just got their wires crossed.  I highly doubt that my phone was going to...

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• Me: ""Hello?""

• Phone: ""Thanks for telling us you wanted MORE INFORMATION about this great offer!!!  My name is Mike and I want to ..."" Blah blah blah... ""Write down my number in case you have any questions!  That number is xxx-xxx-xxxx!!!""

• Me: ""*click*""

Okay....  So now I have this piece of shit's *actual* phone number.  Time to teach him a lesson.

• Me: ... Dialing ... waiting ... Ringing!!!

• Phone: ""Leave a message! ***BEEP!***""

• Me: ""Hey Mike!  Guess what you can do?  You can eat my *actual* asshole!  That's right!  It's covered with fresh chocolate frosting, too!!!  It might taste a little strange at first, but you'll get used to it...  ***YOUR MOM DID!*** *click*""

Haha.  Yeah, I sure showed that guy, didn't I.  Just a little harmless fun, after all.

Right?

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• Me: ""Hello?""

• Random Dude : ""Yeah, did I just miss a call from you?""

• Random Dude : ""Oh, okay then.  Bye."" *click*

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• Random Chick : ""WHO IS THIS?""

• Me: ""Excuse me?""

**bzzzzt** ... **bzzzzt** ... *ring ring*

• Me: ""Hello?""

• Random Chick : ""Did I just miss a call from you?""

***Mother.  Fucker.***

Over the course of the next 4 hours my phone was bombarded with calls from irate people wanting to be taken off the list.  It was NUTS.  HUNDREDS of calls.  Text Messages.  My voicemail box was destroyed.

***That bastard changed the number Caller ID shows to give people MY NUMBER INSTEAD.***  Pissed off doesn't begin to describe how I felt.  Fortunately that phone number was one I only used for close family, so it was a trivial matter to change it, but still.

So, yeah...  He got me good.

TL;DR - I left a choice message on a telemarketers voicemail.  He made me his bitch.

2yjwsy,non_TBI,"So, my life seems to be stitched together by TIFU moments, going back as far as I can remember. Anyway this one happened this morning...

I was taking a shower, pretty normal, nothing out of the ordinary. I have a toothbrush and some toothpaste on the little rack thing, some days I'll brush my teeth while showering, some days I'll do it over the sink. 

I was up early so was taking my time doing stupid stuff like filling my ears up with water, seeing how hot I could handle the water...stupid shit like that..I'm 32 btw! 

Then I decided to brush my teeth. But instead of brushing to and fro with my hand, I closed my eyes and shook my head side to side. I was trying to see if I could get my whole mouth done while keeping my arm in a fixed position. It worked quite well until I'd finished...

The second I stopped brushing and opened my eyes I was unable see straight or balance and it felt like the whole bath tub was sinking on one side. I grabbed the shower curtain to steady myself, this immediately came off of the pole, I fell forwards out of the bath tub and ended up in a heap of naked ness and shower curtain on the bathroom floor! 

Still kind of disoriented I just lay there laughing, then I heard my 8 yo son run up the stairs and open the bathroom door to check on me! He immediately burst out crying! This made me laugh even more!!

When I finally got up off the floor and sorted the mess out and had spoken to my son he said he thought I'd gone crazy...he says heard me scream, then a big thud, then he came running up the stairs and saw my laying on the floor, naked, wrapped in the shower curtain, laughing my head off while I was foaming at the mouth! 



EDIT...tl/dr Brushed my teeth in the shower by moving my head only. Fell out of the bath tub, son burst into tears when he saw me naked, wrapped up in a shower curtain, laughing while foam was coming out of my mouth.

Wow, someone gave me gold for my FU. Thank you /u/kay_k88"
2w7q85,non_TBI,"Okay, so maybe that's a no-brainer.
But this is how it went down:

My coworker and I were making small talk with a customer's 5 year old during checkout and he asked how old my coworker was.
She told him to guess and he guessed 20. She is 19 so she said, ""Wow! Very close! I'm 19.""

Now, I'm 20 and this kid is a good guesser so I'm going to give him a shot at my age.
That's where I fucked up.

""Okay now guess me!""
""Ummmm.... 37!""
Me, taken aback, I scoff.
""Well, no. I'm 20, but I've always been told I seem a little bit older.""

""Oh. Probably because you're fat.""


Edit:
Hi, OP here. I didn't expect you all to find my story so amusing, and I certainly didn't expect all the responses you've posted for me. Thank you for sharing your funny stories and words of encouragement. These responses made me feel better than some. (You know who you are.)

Let me address a few of your comments.

This story took place at a previous job about 6 months ago. I've come to terms with the fact that the little guy didn't mean to upset me, but I still think of this every now and then and it hurts.

**Yes, I'm fat.** I've been overweight for as long as I can remember. I struggle with chronic depression and anxiety, and while this is not a good excuse for my laziness and gluttony, I do believe it carries some *weight.* Those of you that understand mental illnesses may be familiar. I am receiving treatment and I'm working on bettering my mind and body, but it has been an uphill battle."
3j2bv6,non_TBI,"So I posted a topic ranting about my height yesterday that blew up, and my friends have been telling me to ""post the yugioh story"" here now. I will never be able to live this down - it will follow me and my brother (Chris) for as long as we live. 

Me and Chris are identical twins. We used to look almost exactly the same to the point where my mom could even be fooled by it, and he's my best friend in the world. In 18 years we've never had a real fight. Anyway, we were both always the same height growing up. Seeing who's taller was a frequent playful competition between us, but it'd come down to splitting hairs. Regardless, we were average height for our age all through elementary school until about 7th grade, when we both dipped down to the 10th percentile or so. Our concerned parents took us to the doctor by the end of the year and apparently found our HGH and IGF-1 levels to be extremely low, diagnosing us both with hypopituitarism. We get prescribed HGH injections and get taught how to administer them into our legs by ourselves. 

We *hated* these injections with a passion. We didn't think we needed them and fought our parents constantly about it, especially because we had to do it every single night. Our parents told us we would just have to do it until we got back to the 50th percentile of height. They felt terrible making us do this though, and said they would buy us each 3 packs of yugioh cards every week as long as we just did it without complaining. Chris started collecting yugioh cards before this and had been dueling his friends during lunch, so I was kinda excited to start making a deck with the packs our parents bought us. After a few weeks I was completely addicted and looked on eBay for cards I needed, researched deck builds, etc. It was really fun actually. 

Meanwhile, Chris had this girl that he was obsessed with. He would always bring her up to me and said he wanted to ask her out, but didn't know how. We find out through a mutual friend that this girl thinks Chris is cute, but too short for her to date (she was 4-5 inches taller or so at the time). 
Chris moped and cried for hours in our room when he heard this. I'd never seen him get so upset over anything before and I felt terrible. 

All of a sudden Chris comes to me with a proposal. He wants to take my injections for a little and offers me his 3 packs of yugioh cards every week for as long as he can have them. In the last 3 months I noticed no difference in height (we actually had both grown an inch) and hated doing them anyway, so I happily agreed to the trade. He only wanted them for a few weeks or months at most, and we both didn't think they even worked. Still, I felt amazing getting 6 packs of cards a week while he obsessed over getting taller, hoping that the double dose would help. He also agreed to let me take both shots later on if I wanted, he just wanted them for now. 

We got this by our parents and pulled this off for 11 months. In that time Chris had shot up 7 inches to 5'5"", and I only grew one inch to 4'11"". My poor mom took to so many doctors, and none of them understood how I wasn't growing like Chris was. High school started, Chris asks the girl out a week into school and she said yes! They are still together 4 years later, but that's besides the point. As a 4'11"" freshman guy I felt so damn overwhelmed by high school and decided to ask Chris for my share back. I still played yugioh but was moving past it quickly, and I realized that I needed to start the HGH very very soon. He asked to do them until New Years, at which time I could take both back for myself if I wanted them. Sounded good to me. 

Well I couldn't wait that long. I was SO short for my age and Chris was starting to look huge next to me, so we switched after thanksgiving instead. I was still 4'11"" and he was now 5'8"", and our extended family was shocked to see Chris (but not me) 9 inches taller than he was during last year's family party. I hated the huge height difference between us now so much and needed to start the shots immediately. Everyone reassured me that I'd be fine and was just a late bloomer. I started the 2 per day injection routine with lots of excitement this time. 

By the end of 9th grade we both saw an endocrinologist (mainly for me), who took x-rays of our bones. Then she drops this on us: we were done growing. Completely done growing. We were told to discontinue the shots, as they wouldn't help at all anymore since they had to be administered while the growth plates were still open to be effective. The plates went from wide open to closed for both of us in that one year time span. Chris measured in at 5'10.5 that day, and I was still 4'11"" and 1/2"". I couldn't believe it.  In a fluster, I explained to my parents/the doctor what Me and Chris did this whole time and needed to know if it could be fixed. She tells me she can't help me anymore - I should've listened to her and done my own injections. We were literally ""grounded"" by our parents for over a month after this meeting. 

By senior year we had topped out - Chris was 5'11"" and I made it to 5'0"" and 1/4"". Being this height as a guy sucks more than anything. The worst part is that I did it to myself too. Chris apologized so many times and even cried with me once about it. We are still just as close as ever, but it sucks that he doesn't have to endure any of the issues I have related to height. 

I just started college (penn state) and everyone is just massive here. I feel like an actual midget a lot of the time and get shit for my height every single day. I fucked up big time and never imagined a little agreement from 5 years ago would alter my entire life forever. 

I still have a kickass yugioh deck though. "
2yckrv,non_TBI,"This didn't happen today, but I thought it would be a decent first post. 

So, I had been seeing this girl for several months. I had made it very clear to her that I wasn't interested in a serious relationship and this was just a companionship/sex arrangement. She wasn't a fan of this, but she went along with it anyway. 

The problem with this girl is that she was incredibly boring. Her stories made baby seals club themselves. Her voice made me want to drive into oncoming traffic. She was a sweet girl, but SO fucking boring. 

It had become very apparent that the amount of effort it took for me to even be around her was overtaking the less-than stellar sex we were having. I needed to get out. 

It was agreed upon that I would go out to see her after I left work one night. I felt like I owed her a face-to-face so that I can offer closure and an explanation as to why I didn't want to continue seeing her. I get to her friend's place (where she was staying), she got in the car and we went for a drive. 

After maybe 5 or so miles, I pull into a parking lot so that we could actually talk.  I break the news to her that I don't think we should continue our arrangement any longer. She didn't take this well and walked out of the car. We were at least 5 miles from her place and I knew her cell battery had just died, so I asked her to get back into the car and I'll drive her home. I wish I wouldn't have done that. 

On the drive home she remained very quiet. I was pouring out cliches as to why I didn't want to see her. It's not you, it's me, you're a great girl and you'll find better, I'm actually doing you a favor. You get the point. 

I should mention here that the road I was driving on was a connector between two towns so the speed limit was 50, but I'd typically do 60-65 through that stretch. On this particular night, I elected to do 45 so that I had a little extra time to give her some closure. 

I had just regurgitated another cliche for her when the unthinkable happened. Without a single warning or a single word from her mouth, she opened up the car door and dove out  at 45 MPH. I immediately stop the car and begin running back while calling 911. She wasn't moving so I thought she was dead. As I ran up next to her, she began to move and cry. I immediately went from concerned to boiling blood furious. Between giving directions to the 911 operator, I was yelling at her asking her why she jumped out of my car. She kept saying she didn't know what happened. 

After a few minutes, police and ambulance show. Ambulance workers tend to her, police berate me with questions. I'm no prize, so the cops were equally confused as to why a seemingly normal girl jumps out of a fast moving car. 

I was so embarrassed as a crowd began to form to see what the commotion was. At this point, the cops are giving me a sobriety test. I'm still in my work clothes. Ambulance takes here away and cops determine I wasn't drunk and told me to just go home. 

6 hours later she texts me a picture of her face from her hospital bed! She had some bad road rash and a few broken bones. I didn't respond and haven't spoken to her since. 

TL;DR- Told a girl I didn't want to see her anymore. She jumped out of a fast moving car then sent me a picture of the damage. Don't stick your dick in crazy, kids. "
30wlwg,non_TBI,"I made a hot pocket in the oven last night, and I of course needed to test if it was cool enough to eat. So I used the most appropriate method I could think of, I took a small bite[7]. Superheated ""cheese"" comes out, but no big surprises there.

I proceeded to devour both pockets and sooth my burning lips and mouth with an icy beer. I went about my night and everything was normal. This morning I noticed I had burned my bottom lip near the right corner. It wasn't too bad, just a small blister I noticed while shaving. 

I went to work and went about my day, and proceeded to forget about my burned lip. I got off work and met up with my girlfriend. She gives me a big kiss, which then pops the blister. She pulls away quickly as I reach towards the blister. She looks at my lip and asks me what is on it. I say it's just a blister, but she just keeps staring and analyzing it. After a minute she picks up her purse and says, ""no, that's herpes"", calls me an asshole and accused me of cheating on her. She tells me we're over and started freaking out that she now has herpes. I keep trying to tell her it's a hot pocket burn as she leaves the bar, but she just stormed out flipping me the bird while everyone just gave me a death stare. 

I checked out myself in the mirror and the blister popped really badly, it looks pretty nasty, but I don't think it looks like herpes. 

This all happened an hour ago and she's not answering my texts or calls.

Tldr: I ate a hot pocket, burned my lip, gf left me cause the burn kind of looks like herpes. 


Photo of blister: http://imgur.com/6ijz9k0

Update: She still hasn't responded, but thanks for all the support. I dunno what is going on with her, but maybe this was the best hot pocket ever. 

Edit: wow first page! RIP inbox thanks for all the support everybody!

Edit 2: to answer some of the questions, her ass is Kate hot, she is very far in the hot side of crazy/hot scale (I thought less crazy though), and we've been together 2 years.

2zwrfq,non_TBI,"This happened yesterday.

My husband downloaded the water your body app and has been working towards tracking his health. He has been trying to get me to download the app for a few days, but I kept forgetting. So last night I finally got it on my phone, and today I was hoping to impress my husband with my dedication by reaching my goal on water consumption, 206 ounces. 

I am drinking water what seems like constantly, and check my progress half way through the day. It was only at 26%. I persist and drink more water. We had a tax return appointment that was so agonizing as my bladder was full for the whole hour, most relieving piss of my life. 

By the end of the day I lost count of how many times I used the bathroom. There was one time I peed, then almost immediately had to pee again.

In the evening we compare each other's goal percent and mine was barely over 50%. Wtf, how would I be able to drink twice as much without pissing myself I thought. I ask my husband what his goal amount of water is and its a little over 100 ounces. How could mine be 206? I check my settings and turns out I somehow entered 406 pounds as my weight. No wonder I had to pee so much today! And good news! I reached my goal and then some. 126%!

TLDR: Excuse me while I use the restroom."
2v0dnu,non_TBI,"So my wife and I are done having kids at this point, and I decided to volounteer for a vasectomy as it is supposed to be much less invasive than her permanent options.   Any time I started to freak out about the upcoming visit to Dr. Diddle, I soothed myself with thoughts of endless, condomless, pregnancyless, sexy hump days.  It's the promised land.


First of all, the doctor didn't use enough freezing.  You know that feeling when someone cuts into your scrotum?  No?  Well I do.


Second, you know that feeling when someone is tugging on your testicles?  No?  I do.


Lastly, you know that smell of your balls being burned?  I wish I didn't.  As a bonus, I could actually see the smoke wafting lazily towards the ceiling.  


TDLR: 1/10, would not allow doc with knife near my balls again.

3af53x,non_TBI,"I tried to post this the other day but like a rookie I didn't know about the weekend rule so I'll try again. Anyway, just like all the other TIFU's this didn't even come close to happening today. This happened after a house party when I was quite a bit younger, I'm now 25 and still get a laugh out of this every now and again.

My Dad was a pretty heavy smoker when I was growing up and he quit just after he got pneumonia, ever since then my Mum had been always onto us about never smoking because it was bad for us and we could die etc etc. Anyway, I went to a house party one Saturday night and was around a lot of kids trying to show how cool they were by smoking 14 packs in one night, which in turn saturated my clothes with cigarette smoke. While all the cool kids where smoking I was 4 knuckles deep in some girl, all while thinking I was in fact the cool kid, because while every other guy was out smoking I was finger banging the bejeezus out of this chick, which while being a young teenager it was up there with cool things to do. Along came midnight and with it, my Mum to pick me up. So I tried my best to make it look like I hadn't been drinking and jumped in the car for the ride home. About two mins into the journey she asked me if I had been smoking because thats all she could smell on my clothes, and me telling her that I hadn't wasn't enough, she wanted some tangible proof, and that my friends, is where I fucked up.

Keep in mind I was only young and had been drinking so for me this all happened pretty fast. The only thing she thought to do to prove my innocence was to smell my fingers and at that stage I was nowhere near fast enough to stop her from grabbing my hand and doing exactly that. Immediate silence fell over the car as my Mother had realised I hadn't been smoking, but instead, I had my fingers rammed in some chicks puss for the past 30 mins. We didn't speak for the rest of the car trip home, she never asked if I had been smoking at a party again, and to this day, I've found its been the most effective way to ever get out of something that someone has accused me of.

TL;DR Went to a party with heaps of people smoking, fingered some girl, Mum smelt my fingers after.

Edit: In regards to the knuckle conundrum yes there is three knuckles per finger BUT I only got in the first two knuckles plus some (probs 98% of a full finger) 2 fingers with two knuckles each = 4 knuckles ;) not sure how anyone thinks they can get the third knuckle in a girls puss without fisting/killing said girl.

Edit 2: Can't believe how much this has blown up, good to see someone else can get a laugh out of this as much as I do. Ty for the gold kind stranger :')"
3kdtzg,non_TBI,"So this happened a few hours ago.

Backstory: I work in a small industry firm, with no more than 10 employees, in the finance department, so going on reddit is fine since there's no customers come in or out of the office.

Everyday I come to work and most days, I'm always on reddit to pass time if there's no work to do. I usually go on the popular, main subreddits including TIFU. When I go on tifu, I usually scroll down to hide the title TODAY I FUCKED UP (since its obviously inappropriate at work). But today was different. Today, I was a dumbass.

Instead of scrolling down, to hide the title, I forgot and my boss called me in to have a word about some work. So I walked over and spoke to him for about 5 minutes. I returned to my desk and found the fucking CEO of the firm looking at my computer screen. I walked over as if nothing was wrong, and said ""Morning boss"". No reply from him. I looked at the screen and saw in huge letters TODAY I FUCKED UP. I nearly died. My heart started racing. Thinking of an excuse, he looked at me, pointed at the title and said ""Looks like you did fuck up today"" and started laughing. He told me to get back to work and be careful next time and don't go on sites like this as he walked away. Still in shock that I dodged a bullet, I sat down at my desk and breathed a huge sigh of relief, thinking I'm never going onto reddit at work again. An hour passed, and guess what, I'm on reddit because reddit is love, reddit is life.

TL;DR Went to tifu at work, CEO saw it, laughed it off, dodged a bullet, still on reddit

**EDIT;** Woah, this blew up! Thank you for the Gold <3 Looking at your replies, most of you saying to lock my computer when leaving my desk, good idea, next time ;)
And no, the CEO isn't any of you guys!... or is it... hey boss xD"
2t3pz2,non_TBI,"So I was on a date with a girl to the cinema. The date went well, but it was only a second date, and I still didn't know if she liked me or not. So she went to the bathroom, and I decided to go to the shop next to it while waiting. Now we had gone to see the hobbit and I was starving as i hadn't eaten since dinner before, and I didn't feel I needed a snack during it, and I didn't want to ask her for some in case she thought it was weird. 
So when I went to the shop I saw condoms, and I started to ask myself if I may need some myself. Now I'm a 19 year old virgin, so I'm very oblivious to any signs of interest from girls, and I never had a need to already have condoms. Now I only had enough money for the condoms by themselves, and then I wouldn't have been able to afford the chocolate. So I bought the chocolate. BIG MISTAKE. 
I drive her back to her college apartment, and walked her to the door. She then invites me inside for some tea. Now being inexperienced and kind of clueless I think she genuinely means a cup of tea. So we are there sitting on the couch drinking tea when she leans in and starts kissing me. Things escalate and she's dragging me to her room and we start getting undressed. Then she ask the dreaded question,
""Do you have a condom?""
So now I'm sitting here, still a virgin, with a mars bar wrapper in my hand.
TLDR: Bought a bar of chocolate instead of condoms while on a date, and now I'm still a virgin because of it.

Edit: wow thanks for the response guys it is really helpful. I decided to take the advice of a few of you and rang her. Things seem all good, and she wants to go out again. Pretty clueless as to what I'll do, but I'm definitely not forgetting the condoms."
2fzxrh,non_TBI,"Last night, we were in bed and my girlfriend was scratching her eye viciously, complaining that she suffers from Chronic Dry Eye and not from Leaving Contacts in for Too Long. As we're in the spooning position, she finally sighs and asks me to ""Make her cry"" so her eye gets some moisture. I quickly think of how to do that on short notice. 

Should I tickle her relentlessly? 

Do I need to Ray Rice her? 

And then a lightbulb goes off in my brain. I lean close to her ear and whisper to my girlfriend of over three years: ""I've never really loved you.""

Needless to say, tears were had. I'm not a smart man.

Edit: wow, my inbox. So a lot asked what happened afterwards. She was caught off guard because I said it so sternly like I meant it. I did not. I reaffirmed my love and did not have to sleep on the couch! "
323yx3,non_TBI,"Note; my teacher is an alcoholic.
Lately i've been feeling tired of school, and as a result i'm constantly running late for most of my courses. Also, i hadn't slept much that night because i've trouble sleeping when it's windy outside, and that particular night it was windy as hell. When i'm tired, i'm usually quite moody, and sometimes i turn kinda aggressive when someone is being a dick towards me. 

It was the last course of the day, and i was running late for history class because i had to talk to my science teacher. When i walked in the door, my teacher said in a humiliating voice; ""why don't you just quit the science courses? I bet you'll fail them all anyways."" Being the moody asshole that i am, i answered; ""Well, if i fail them all, i can just become a drunken history teacher anyways."" 

I heard people gasping in the classroom, and the moment i realized what i'd said, i understood the consequences. Needless to say, my teachers jaw dropped to the floor, like one of those pianos in one of those cartoons, and the class went dead silent. 

Now i'm sitting at the principal's office.

Edit: Gold! thank you guys! I love that so many people supported me on this. I had to have a meeting with my principle and teacher. They said something about unacceptable behavior, and i had to say sorry to my teacher. When i explained why i'd said it, my teacher also had to say sorry to me. "
36yox3,non_TBI,"I'm a guy in my 20s and I don't flirt. I'm not one of those guys who can come up and deliver a pick-up line with a straight face, or ask a girl out. I get way too embarrassed and blushy. For whatever reason, I have this irrational fear that someone should think I'm hitting on them.So I just don't flirt. EVER. 

Anyways, I was staying with my mom for the weekend and she asked me to go get groceries for dinner, as she had just gotten back from work and was exhausted. I was happy to do it as she was buying. No big deal right? WRONG, BUT WHO COULD FORESEE WHAT WAS TO COME? 

So I drive to the market, collect the groceries, and pretty soon I'm looking to check out. I get in the only checkout lane available and immediately see that the cashier is very...very pretty. Too pretty for me to handle. I quickly whip around in search of another lane open, but there were  none. I gather myself and think,'YOU CAN DO THIS. DO IT FOR YOUR MOTHER.'

So accepting my fate, I strategize the most plain and standard transaction possible between her and me. 'Stick to what you know' I thought to myself. 

Before long it was my time to shine. I presented her with my groceries for scanning and proceeded to fumble around with my wallet (this was pretty much the entire plan). All was going extremely well and we were even getting along with enthusiastic dialogue such as (her:) ""Did you find everything ok?"" and (me:) ""Yes"". Then she hit me with a question that, in my calculated strategy, I had forgotten to plan for...

""Do you have an express card with us that you'd like to use?""

""No, but I have a phone number for one"" is what I found myself saying. It was an instinctive, reactionary response. I gave her my phone number while still absent-mindedly fiddling with my wallet. 

A moment passed.

""...I'm sorry sir, that phone number isn't coming up in our system...""

My mind clicked. Not my phone number, my mom's phone number. My mother. My mothers credit card. I was about to present a woman's credit card after trying to get a discount with a wrong number. 'This looks really bad' I thought to myself. 

So I turned to her, as casually as humanly possible, and said,""Oh, that's my cell phone number""

This pause was longer, so long I looked up, and in her face I saw the comprehension. In her mind, I just pulled the smoothest shit in the history of shit. I was the coolest of cool in her eyes: giving her my phone number in the slyest of ways. She started to smile and this is when I realized what I'd done. She looked at me realizing how cool I was and I looked at her realizing how cool she thought I was. 

Obviously, like all smooth people, I freaked the fuck out.

""OH, NO, IM SORRY DON'T USE THAT NUMBER, YOU... I HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER, NOT MINE, MY MOMS, I HAVE A MOM.""

I paid for the food and I got outta that store as fast as possible - leaving the cashier in a haze of confusion as I furiously fast walked away - destined never to be smooth again. 

TL;DR: I gave the cashier the wrong phone number for an express card. She thought I was flirting and giving her my number. I freaked out.

3eim3w,non_TBI,"This happened a few days ago, during my honeymoon.

My wife and I were on an adventure tour of Ecuador. One day included a whitewater rafting trip with a group of 4 Germans we did not know. For safety's sake, we were all wearing helmets and life vests. After an hour or so of rafting, we pulled ashore for a bit. My wife and I got off the raft at the same time, with me a step behind her. After glancing over my shoulder at the river, I turned around, reached out, and patted her on the butt, saying ""Would you like to go for a swim?""

Two things happened. First, I heard my wife laughing hysterically, but from about 10 feet away. Second, the person who I had just patted on the butt turned around in shock. And she was a 16 year old.

After I rapidly explained what happened, and people could tell from my wife's reaction that I was not lying, everyone had a good laugh. Well, maybe not me as much as the others.

The girl was not bothered at all. Even her father, who was also on the trip, thought it was amusing. My wife is now going to make fun of me for at least the next 50 years, and I deserve it.

TL;DR - A brief case of mistaken identity facilitated by rafting gear led me to pat the butt of a 16 year old girl instead of my wife.

Edit 1: I did apologize profusely to the girl."
3fno2z,non_TBI,"So this happened about 20 mins ago and I will try to keep it short. On mobile sorry for any errors.

A little backstory about the company I work for,
While it isn't a terribly strict place to work, it is very heavy handed with disciplinary actions for violating company rules. With most stating immediate termination for violation.

Anyway, I usually get in around 10 and take my lunch at noon. Today I decided to get a sprite from the vending machine  as I hadn't had one in a very long time.
While I was eating my lunch, my boss walked in to inform me about an upcoming meeting.
Mid sentence she spotted the sprite and told me to wait here. Thinking nothing of it I continued to eat my lunch.
About ten mins later she had called security to escort me out of the office.
Very confused I ask why? 
She responded with, ""you are in violation of company policy by drinking an alcoholic beverage during work hours"". I was still confused, mainly because I am only 20 yrs old.
I was being escorted out before I had any chance to explain myself.

So naturally I get really mad and inform them that I had nothing alcoholic with me.
Then I remembered the Sprite.
Recently, Sprite cans have this,""obey the phrase"" thing going on that has some phrases written in a weird script.
So from a distance it looks like a beer can.
I am trying to explain this and they aren't hearing any of it. 
Then the head of HR(Barbara) walks by and asks what is happening. I explain my half while my boss explains hers.
In the process of explaining , lo and behold Barbara is holding the same can. 
She holds it up and asks my boss if this looked similar. 
She responds then they go check my office.
She finds the can and let's me go.
Now I am sitting in my office writing this while Barbara is having a ""meeting"" about my boss's actions 

TL;DR almost got fired because of a Sprite can.

Picture of can in comments 


UPDATE: My boss is planning to find someway to make this right 
She isn't a terrible boss, as she is actually pretty friendly 
As she told me, she has had problems with others in the past that have violated that  rule and got into some pretty serious problems for not catching it. She was protecting her job which I can understand.
This company hires a lot of 20 ish year old people so can't really stay mad about it.
She plans to buy me lunch at some point, though I doubt it. 
In terms of the can ,I am making a memo about it to let others know to get the information before losing their minds. And will post the memo sometime later.
As far as HR is concerned, it's just another story to pass around 


Update 2: there is another post on Tifu as someone claiming to be my boss on the other side of the story 
While I do give him/her credit for attempted karma whoring, they don't even know the name of my company or my position.
Someone below in the comments has posted the link to the other post and as soon as I can will be linking it myself 
Thanks for the support guys 

Update 3: someone said I should post to Twitter at sprite to see what would happen. 
Just did it

399u96,non_TBI,"I really like my girlfriend, and I think she likes me but having a relationship with her may be a bit difficult from now on.
We went to her house for dinner, and everything went smoothly until we were done eating. She has a litte brother who is 5-6 years old (not sure) and he seemed to like me, and we threw his little plastic ball back and forth. He started getting competitive and threw way harder than I'd expected, so as a reflex I slapped the ball mid-air so it flew, knocked over and broke this urn. The urn contained my girlfriends grandma. Without missing a beat her little brother runs out and fucking points the finger at me and said I did on purpose, and the little shit even started to cry. I tried to explain what really had happened, but they gave me the classic ""We think it's best you go home now"", and my girlfriend took her parents side.
So here I am the day after, and she still won't return my calls or my texts.
We might be done.

EDIT: She saw my post here, since it apparently has made it to the front page of reddit, and broke it off. According to her I'm ""childish and unable to take things seriously"". Guess first round's on me RIP.
EDIT 2: I must explain since a lot of people seem to think this is fake: I've been a reddit lurker for a long time, and only made this account to share my story with you. Never imagined it would blow up like this, and I can understand you being suspicious. Your comments made me realized how fucked up this whole thing was, and I wanna thank you all! You're the best :) (Thank you kind redditor for the gold)"
3wuyfq,non_TBI,"As with most fuck-ups, this didn't actually happen today. It was over 9 years ago.

My mom informed me that morning that we would be having ""Aunt Maggie"" over. I had never met this Aunt, but there were plenty of other family members showing up out of nowhere, so I didn't think anything of it. We spent several hours cleaning the house to prepare, and then they arrived. Aunt Maggie and her two kids, a girl around my age, and a boy several years younger. We spent the whole day playing, as kids do, while my mom and my aunt talked. Eventually, as the day was winding down, the three of us were in my room playing with legos. Aunt Maggie called to her kids, telling them it was time to go. We all came out and started saying goodbye to eachother. Before leaving, the girl came to me in the kitchen and asked me if I would go on a date with her. ""No."" I said, wondering what kind of person asks their cousin on a date. Looking back, my tone of voice was about the worst it could have been, probably sending the message ""I wouldn't want to be seen in public with you."" She was visibly disappointed, and left. I went back to my room afterwards and found an unfinished message written with legos. ""Will you go o"" Cute, but I'm not gonna romance my cousin.

Fast forward a few months, when I found out we're not actually related, and ""Aunt"" is apparently just a term of endearment.

Every time I see this girl, I'm blown away. She's stunning, and I'm a moron.

TL;DR: Didn't date my cousin, turns out she's not my cousin. Kick myself in the ass daily."

Okay, so this is my first Reddit post so please forgive me for formatting errors. I'm also on my phone so spelling errors might occur.


This FU happened 10 years ago, unfortunately I was only 7 at the time so I didn't have access to Reddit. 


Anyway, at that age I absolutely loved astronomy. Everything about it was amazing. I loved the stars, the moon, the milky way, the distant solar anomalies and especially the constellations. The only problem was that I had no idea what to call half of them. I knew the basics, the big dipper and ect. I wish I never loved them as much as I did. My father was amazing. He knew how much I loved looking at the stars all night long so he bought me night sky related toys. Our church even have a blow up rocket ship that he took me to see. My favorite out of all of them was this silver metal green laser. I was never allowed to touch it; but it represented everything the sky was. Bright, colorful, and a learning experience. Because with that Laser to shine the way, my father would teach me all the names of the Stars  (he would buy books to learn them and do research so that when the night came we could go outside on the porch together and he could explain the sky and all of the little myths that went with the stars.)


[EDIT: There wasn't actually a meteor shower, I think I thought there was because of what happens later. The memory is a bit fuzzy and I apologize for that. Just imagine a clear sky and a lot of stars.] One night there was a meteor shower and my dad took me outside to watch with him. He brought the laser with him so that during the shower we could spend some time learning more of the constellations. Sometimes he would repeat old stories like the brothers Gemini and Orion the hunter. But I didn't mind. Each story was told to me as if it was my first time hearing it. This was a few days after New Years Eve. 


During our routine I see a meteor that looked a little odd. It was slower than the others and had been lasting pretty long. I've never seen a comet before, and that's what my little mind thinks it is. So I tell my dad 
about the comet, however he can't see it. That's when he passes the laser to me to point it out. This is the biggest thing in my life at this point. *I* got the laser. *I* was now the master of the universe! So with my 
little heart beating in my ears I pointed it at the comet. I look over at my father and his face has suddenly gotten really pale in the dark. I'm confused when he rips the laser from my small hand and tells me it's time
to go inside. I feel heartbroken, but I was never one to disobey. So I go inside.


The memory gets a little fuzzy here. I remember my mother was making cookies for the next morning and that I was told to go in the bathroom for a shower since my older sister just got finished. In the middle of the shower my mom enters the bathroom and quickly rinses me off and starts to get me dressed before I had even finished. I would have complained but something inside told me to shut up and do as I was told. When we're exiting the bathroom and I'm finally dressed I hear voices coming from downstairs. I don't remember exactly what was said but I could recognize the deep authorative tone. I was scared but still numb from confusion. My mother told my sister and I to stay upstairs while she went down to see my father. 


I looked down the stairwell to see my father talking to three police officers. I was so scared my mind couldn't comprehend was was being said. I sat there and watched as he looked back over his shoulder at me, he was scared. I've never seen my father scared before. I knew I made a mistake I just wasn't sure what it was and I wouldn't know for another 7 years. Well, for a few months after that people started asking my sister and I questions where ever we went. (We were a block from a grocery store and often times we would hold hands and walk together to the store to get milk/eggs ect). They kept asking us about my father and I didn't understand why they wanted to know about him. They asked us if he was abusive and if he hurt us. He never did, he was perfect. Our once quiet street now had a lot of people in it who wanted to talk to us. I was confused but my sister would always answer for me saying things along the lines ""we're not supposed to talk to them."" I didn't know who they were, but they liked taking pictures of us. 


When my mom found out about them we stopped picking up groceries and were moved next door to our Nana's house. Dad would suddenly go missing for days at a time and we would be visited by random family members. My sister was older than me and I think she understood what was going on but to me it was all so eerie. I don't believed I ever complained. Eventually we went back to school, but even there we were asked questions and the other kids seemed to sit a bit further away during lunch. 


Eventually everything settled down but my mom wanted us to move South, closer to our other family members. For 7 years everything was fine, but then Chris Christie was elected governor and I over heard my parents growling about it. That's when I learned what really happened that night. 


A few nights before my father took me to see the meteor shower a man had tried to take down an airplane with a laser and escaped. He was an actual terrorist and honestly wanted to kill people. The night of the meteor shower I had shined a laser at a comet. Only it wasn't a comet, it was a helicopter. They blamed both ""attacks"" on my father and when he tried to explain to the police what he had really been doing a rumor spread that he was trying to ""blame it all on his daughter."" The newspapers threw slander at my family, called us terrorists or just plain morons. My dad was overwhelmed; hell we all were.


We used to love our neighbors but when they were questioned a long time friend of ours said on TV, ""He always looked like an evil man."" That was it. That one sentence shattered every hope my family had of living where we were. 


Everyone thought my father was evil. The prosecutor was Chris Christie. All my father was guilty of was loving us. I could never understand how it all got so cruel so quickly. My dad got sick after a month or two of the investigation. He still had to attend court and had to sit and answer questions while he was burning with a fever. Eventually he cracked and ""confessed"" to both crimes. [Edit: My father took a plea bargain option, but it was undoubtedly because of the stress of the entire thing. I'm sure he would have stuck it out and tried to have went with the innocent option, but it was one of those ""if you confess you don't go to jail"" kind of things. I'm sorry I didn't mention that at first, I'm getting the information 10 years too late and from people who don't really want to talk about it.] He was tired, he wasn't thinking. He wanted to go home. 


He never went to jail, however. I thank God everyday for that. Instead he was labeled a felon, forced to move to protect his wife and 3 daughters, and struggled to earn a living ever since. He had to give up his guns and was legally never allowed to purchase another laser again. And this was all because one night I thought I saw a comet and my dad trusted me. 




Tl:Dr, 

I was 7, liked the stars. Dad takes me outside to teach me constellations with a laser. I shine the laser at a helicopter and my dad gets arrested and tried in court by Chris Christie. We were forced to move.


I'm upvoting you all :)

EDIT JULY 4TH:

Okay so a lot of you are doubting me and that's understandable. Namely u/halwith who is replying to every comment he sees that ""op isn't David Banach's daughter."" So I'm posting a few pictures of my father and me. 

Here's one from an article of my father so you can compare:

Okay and here are some pictures of us: 

Don't forget my dad's aged so he's not as young as he once was. He cut his hair shorter but I honestly think he still looks the same.

373b2u,non_TBI,"So, I find this Toyota pickup on CL that I want to look at, but it's a couple hours away in Nashville. Normally, I would go by myself, but my wife's gotta work so I take my 8 YO son with me. I've got a trailer and the cash in case I decide to buy it. Seller wants to meet in a public place, Walmart. I text him when we get there and he replies that he'll be there in a couple minutes. Guy shows up and I start looking the truck over. I walk around it, get on the ground and check the U joints, and when I stand up the cops are there. Seems that somebody assumed that just because a man and a boy were in a vehicle alone in the middle of a Walmart parking lot, they're having sex.

Unbelievable. I'm coming to realize, I can't go anywhere alone with my son for fear of what others will do. I don't like this place anymore.

Edit: one of my many thoughts on the way home was the provocation for this. Was I victim to something akin to swatting? Could someone have called the cops and reported this knowing full well that nothing was going on, just for kicks?
"
40axfi,non_TBI,"So I was chatting up this girl and she decided she wanted to come over for some fun time, in an attempt to surprise her I planned on standing in front of my door naked and erect so when she came over it would be more sexy (stupid, I know) anyway, I hear a knock and warm myself up before opening the door only to find myself standing there, full mast in front of a horrified postman, I sprinted inside yelling SORRY SORRY SORRY and posted this to reddit for your enjoyment instead of just forgetting it, you're welcome."
40rjmg,non_TBI,"The company I work for was looking to hire a couple of employees last week, and I was put in charge of interviewing potential candidates.

The first applicant came in about 2 hours early, so I had to scramble a bit to gather all the stuff I needed for the interview. My boss told me to get a clipboard so I could take notes. Not finding one, I grabbed a large note pad instead.

About halfway through the first interview the applicant started acting funny. He was professional up until I started taking notes, and then he began nervously laughing and looking around the room, not making eye contact. Really bizarre. At the end of the interview, he barely shook my hand before he beat feet for the door. 

My boss was eager to find out about the interview, since this first candidate looked perfect on paper. I was in the middle of telling her about his weird behavior when her eyes went wide and she started laughing uncontrollably, pointing at the stack of notes in my hands. 

I flipped the note pad over.  ""Would you like to join me for dinner tonight, beautiful?"" Written in permanent marker. Took me a moment to remember that I wrote that myself, about 2 years ago while asking a girl out. 

 Poor guy came in for a job interview, left thinking he had been lured into a date with another dude.

Edit:

The secretary who was scheduling the interviews forgot to tell me that this guy was going to ""come in as soon as he got off work,"" and apparently he did tell her that he might be up to 2 hours earlier than the given appointment time, but she neglected to mention that to me when she gave me the schedule."
3rv4z6,non_TBI,"Today I met up with my family for a funeral and to save money, we all are sharing a hotel room. I am 26 and my family is pretty close so we're fine sharing a room. So this morning we are all up and getting ready for the day. After my turn in the shower, I'm drying off in the bathroom when I hear my dad telling mom a interesting story. Me, being curious, go out and listen to his riveting tale. So here I am, casually drying my hair and listening to dad when I noticed my mom is giving me a puzzled look. She then casually asks ""do you know that you are naked?"" 

It was only then that i realized that the towel I was using to cover up is currently sitting on my neck after drying my hair, giving my parents and brothers front row seats to the viewing of the family jewels, things not seen by them sense childhood baths were still common. I quickly cover up to the roars of laughter from my entire family. Now I have to sit through a reunion tomorrow and I know my family will let all of our relatives know of the peep show I put on.

*edit: Changed nick to neck. Is this really nsfw? "
3dvp3n,non_TBI,"So, my girlfriend and I have been dating for 10 years. I've been planning to propose to her for the past six months: researching about diamonds and figuring out how to do the perfect proposal for her. 

On New Years Eve, I enlisted the help of a few friends to figure out her ring size. She likes to drink, and I figured she would pass out later in the night, at which point we'd slip a ring on her finger to figure out what size I should get. We let the night play out and sure enough, she passed out. After a few tries, we figured out her ring size was about 3.5 or 4.

After a bit of searching, I found a design that I really thought she would like and I ordered it in a size 3.5. It looked perfect.

Now I had the ring, and I knew how I wanted to propose to her. But silly me, I decided that I didn't want the ring to be too big, or too small. I waited for another night when we had both gone out to drink. We came home and she was fast asleep. She's a pretty heavy sleeper, especially when she's had a few drinks. I thought it'd be a great  opportunity to slip the ring on her finger without her knowing, that way I would know how well it really fit and I'd be able to make adjustments before proposing to her. 

To make sure she's dead asleep, I caress her finger with my hands and increase the pressure to see if she has any reaction. She's dead asleep and doesn't even stir. Perfect! So I whip out the ring and slide it onto her finger. With a bit of resistance, it slides on and sits perfectly and she hasn't got a clue that she's wearing her future ring! 

I'm satisfied: 3.5 is the right ring size. As I try to take the ring off, it gets stuck at her knuckle. I didn't see this coming. I gently tug, but it's not working, the ring is stuck! I hold her hand firmly in place and tug and twist a bit more. I'm in a panic; the ring won't come off! I keep going at it for what seems like an eternity (which was probably only 20 seconds) and then I feel her hand pull away from mine. I look toward her and her eyes are wide open. Super shocked. Probably even more shocked than I am. She looks down at her hand and sees the ring! There's not much I could do at this point so I ask her the big question with an embarrassed look on my face, ""will you marry me?"" she sits up and gives me a big kiss and says yes. Thank the Lord! 

She loves the ring, and thinks the proposal is memorable, not ideal... But memorable!

TL;DR: I tested an engagement ring on my fiancée while she was sleeping; ring got stuck and now we're happily engaged."
2vxr5b,non_TBI,"Alright reddit? I fucked up.

I was in a nightclub.

I was speaking to a girl and said I would buy her a drink (she agreed).

I took a swig from my drink. 

Swig went down my airway.

Threw up on said girl. 

Got kicked out of the nightclub. 

That's it.... Bye.

Edit: My shame is now front page. "
3zllxt,non_TBI,"This happened last night.

I really enjoy jelly beans. They're definitely my 'go to' for something sweet to have every once in a while. Sours, gourmet, starburst, you name it; I probably have a jar of them in my pantry.

My family knows I enjoy jelly beans, and for Christmas as a stocking stuffer, they bought me a four pound jar of gourmet Jelly Belly jelly beans, a box of sour, starburst, and miscellaneous flavours. Awesome! I have one or two handfuls a day for after meals or just while I'm working.

Life is good. At least until I made a mistake that almost made me cry. 

So last night I'm chatting to friends, munching from my jelly bean jar when I realize that it's about halfway gone. I get the idea, ""Hey! I should open the three boxes of random flavours and put them all in the jar and mix them up. Then I can just throw the boxes away and have a full jar again.""
And so I did. I opened the three boxes of about .5 lbs of jelly beans each, and put them into the jar, gave it a roll and a shake to mix everything up, and threw the empty stuff away. Huzzah! Refilled jelly beans!

I sit in my computer chair, grab three of my new assorted jelly bean bonanza, and plop the white, black, and red treats into my mouth.
What assaulted my taste buds was probably the most vile thing I have ever tasted in my life. It felt like a nightclub bathroom kicked the door down into my mouth, and started rubbing its nasty grungy tiles of its floor against my tongue in some sort of sick dance.

My face contorted and crumpled into a 'Dear christ what is happening to me?!' expression, and I spat the contents of my mouth out into my hand. It smelled 'awful'. I can't express how bad it was, especially after being chewed up.
Something is DEFINITELY wrong. So I rush to the trash can and remove the boxes to start properly reading the labels.
""Starburst"", okay nothing bad there.
""Sours"", still nope.
""Bean Boozled"", wh-....what is this?

I inspect the box, and it turns out to actually be a little game that jelly belly put together. It has ten flavours within, out of the standard 45 gourmet ones, and of those ten flavours, some of them have been swapped with god awful ones that appear THE EXACT SAME as their partners. To make this clear, they are identical in shape and appearance, their flavours have been swapped.

I pale as I start to read what potential flavours there are. I will list them here for your benefit;

* Pear has a chance to be Snot
* Tutti-Frutti has a chance to be Gym Socks
* Lime has a chance to be Lawn Clippings
* Buttered popcorn? Rotten eggs
* Berry Blue could be Toothpaste
* Chocolate Pudding could be Canned Dog Food
* Caramel Corn is Moldy Cheese
* Peach is Barf
* Coconut is Baby Wipes
* Licorice is Skunk Spray (jfc this guy)

My face gets more and more sad as I read these, and I glance back at the mound of chewed up Satan I spat out to try and gauge the colours of the three I tossed into my mouth.
Skunk Spray, Barf, and Baby Wipes.
It tasted exactly like it said. I'm sitting in my chair slowly realizing what I've done to my Christmas Gift. I've ruined it.
Every handful has a chance to bear one of these god awful, overpowering flavours that will completely ruin any enjoyment out of the rest. I tried, I tried to continue, but the occasional barf or moldy cheese completely ruined my appetite and I had to stop. I'm a man, but I felt like crying. Laugh crying. Staring at this jar of assorted evil.

I went to bed defeated. This afternoon, I have poured out the entire contents onto a blanket, and I've separated out the every member of the ten flavours, good or evil. I found out if you squeeze them and smell it, you can pick up what flavour it is without completely ruining the jelly bean. So this is going to be my afternoon.

Reddit, don't make my mistake. Read your labels, or end up in Jelly Bean limbo like me.

TL;DR - Mixed many kinds of jelly bean flavours, got some Bertie Botts every-flavoured nonsense type, to a magnitude of 10 in the fray. Nearly died from a mouthful of baby wipes and skunk spray, and am now sitting on my floor sorting through good and evil to find the culprits."
3ul7ru,non_TBI,"Technically happened last night but close enough, only just gotten over the trauma to post. 
Me and my girlfriend hired a apartment room for ""alone time"" and all that jazz. 
And after a while and a few drinks we think hey, I've never actually seen my own butthole as you do. So I take a picture of her on my phone alone with a few fingers in and what not and show it to her and then we swap over and does the same, then she got the great idea of trying out her little bullet vibrator on me, I think ""fuck it, why not?""
It feels pretty good, awkward at first but then the vibrator turns on, and she keeps upping the power, it felt good, so I asked her to put it in a little deeper.

Now this is where things go south fast. 
I hear an ""OHSHIT"" behind me with what feels like frantic scrabbling in my ass, as I panic I tense up as you do. And it goes. 
It's gone. There is naut but silence and a dull buzzing from my lower gut as the gravity of the situation set in.

I waddle to the toilet and try and keep calm, while all I can hear is a constant ""bzzzzzzzzz"" which I can feel moving around inside, at one point it must have pressed aginst my stomach in my hunched waddle state, because my Christ it buzzed.

Now bear in mind I'm trying to keep calm focus my muscles and she is FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. Didn't help, thankfully within about 3-4 mins and some iron will from myself there's an almighty crash in the bottom of the toilet and it flies out like a potato out of a potato cannon. 

I'm still a little shaken. And now nothing is going near my butt again

TL;DR 
Girlfriend put a bullet vibrator in my butt, it goes for a trip upwards while on full power, I waddle to the toilet and I put mortar cannons to shame with the force it came out.

Edit: sorry for typos, so hung over while writing this.

Edit2:  For those that ask, I'm a dude. "
37bb4t,non_TBI,"Ok reddit, this is a bit of a long one, but it pays off (promise).

This weekend, for my birthday, I decided to go to London Comic Con for the first time with my good friend D, a con veteran. Friday and Saturday were great days, characterised by drinking, smoking, and meeting all sorts of awesome people. D knew plenty of people there, so I got introduced to them, made delightful new friends, and wandered around in awe of all the fantastic cosplays and cool shit to do. On the Friday night D got given a spliff laced with ~~DMT~~ some weird shit by an otherkin and had a very bad time, but that's another story. On the Saturday night, for me this time, things went badly wrong.

In front of the convention centre is a small green where there's a music stage and people sit around drinking and partying in general until the early hours. We were out there drinking ourselves into a stupor when I noticed a large crowd of people standing in a circle, cheering, and catching the eye of security. I decided to go and check it out, and was greeted by an organised fighting ring officiated by Professor Snape. The rules were simple: no striking, and if you get someone on their back you win. Sounds like fun, right?

Well, it wasn't.

I was doing a half-hearted Superman cosplay (t-shirt plus cape), and in my altered state may have believed I was more like the man of steel than a drunken guy of distinctly average build. I ran back to the group of people I was with and shouted ""I'm gonna go get myself hurt for the respect of people I don't know!""

Professor Snape was only too happy to oblige me, pitting me against a guy dressed as Solid Snake. This should have been my first warning. You don't fuck with Solid Snake.

Surprisingly, we were pretty evenly matched. We were both scrappy, and were both going for the old leg-lift/trip technique. I was considerably drunker than him, so swiftly lost my balance, tripping backwards, reconciling myself to my fate. Unfortunately, my cape proved to be my kryptonite. Snake tripped on it, falling forward over me with his knee extended. I half-remember what happened next.

My right ball was caught between his very solid knee and the floor- this hurt. It hurt a lot. Writhing in agony, I put on my bravest smile, shook the desperately apologising Snake's hand, and limped back to my group, laughing at my own misfortune. My new friends were only too happy to join me. Half an hour later, the pain hadn't gone. An hour later, the pain hadn't gone. My old friend D is a medical professional. He said ""dude, you're fine"". I wasn't fine. I was pretty fucking far from fine. I ~~walked~~ limped back to our hotel (a mile away), cradling my rapidly swelling ball-sack. I took some painkillers and passed out.

On waking up in the morning, I looked inside my pants and was greeted with what looked like an aubergine (eggplant) perched on top of a red onion. I called down from the bunk: 

""D, how good a friend are you?""
""Very, I'd say""
""....will you take a look at my dick?""

I whipped it out, and the look of horror on his face told me all I needed to know. My dick and balls were entirely purple, and monstrously swollen. I was in agony.

""Go to hospital. NOW.""

I wasn't going to argue. 12 hours later, having been giving an extraordinary amount of painkillers, an ultrasound, urine and blood tests, I was driven via ambulance to a surgical ward in the next county. In my drug-induced haze, I remember snatches of conversation- *""think we can save the testicle... lacerations... blood clot... crushed... swollen""*

Waking up in the morning after passing out for the second night in a row, I was told that while it had been close, the doctor thought I would be keeping my now-egg-sized right ball. He would, however, have to apply what he referred to as a 'scrotal turban'. I was discharged, miles from London, and had to limp across much of the city cradling my elephantine, turban-clad scrotum in order to catch the train home. I'd missed all of the Sunday of Comic Con, and didn't gain any respect at all as far as I can tell.

And that, reddit, is why I'm off work with a mummified man-purse and pumped full of codeine. My first Con.

TL;DR Went to first con, fought Solid Snake, now have purple ballsack the size of a baseball wrapped in a scrotum-turban.

Edit 5: [Video or it didn't happen!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPl999Y4UYg) Turns out it wasn't snake who landed on me, he was just on the other side. Please don't hold it against me, I was super drunk and in a world of pain, so not quite as with it as I could have been. It also, apparently, makes for a better story ;)"
43ndpn,non_TBI,"This happened just a bit ago. I was playing the Division beta with my two longtime friends, girlfriend posted up on the couch next to me. Things progress and shes feeling antsy so she starts becoming ""playful"" with me as Im playing. It becomes too much to bear, and I put my mic on pause to do the dirty deed. We go at it, quite crazily, and my girlfriend is not the quiet type when it comes to sexy time. We finish up, and are laying there, taking quick breather when she asked:

""So what happens when the controller dies with the mic on?""

""It goes to.....the......kinect....."" 
I respond, slowly grasping the situation. I quickly call out to check our terrible hypothesis. 

""Hello?""

........no answer, so I try again

""Chandler?""

""Yes?"" He responds in a fit of laughter joined by my other mate. Hours of rolling laughter later and our friendship is now at a much closer, and much stranger, level. My girlfriend is embarassed, mortified, and Im not sure how to tell her I find it hilarious.

Tl;Dr: controller died during sex, xbox live party heard the whole ball slapping scene unfold

Edit: Some people are calling bullshit because of the specificity of the question. I wear turtle beaches, so when I play my tv volume is super low, but on. During sex we didnt notice becuase, well sex, and only when laying after did we notice that the voices of the party were now able to be heard in the TV. Totally true story, boy scouts honor."
3x7zba,non_TBI,"This happened a few days ago.  I was out with my two youngest kids at the grocery store. When we were pulling up, in front of the Christian Book store next door, there was a mother and two young kids, probably about 5 and 3, holding a sign that said they were ""poor and hungry, please help."" I am trying to teach my children about giving back at a young age so they grow up to be good, helpful and respectful people. Since we were going into the grocery store anyway, I picked up a small jug of milk, some bread, some fruits and two pieces of candy for the kids (since it's the holidays and it was starting to snow, the candy was more of a bonus for them being forced to stand outside in the cold). I explained to my boys what we were doing and they were excited to help out. We paid for all of our things and walked out. I was feeling pretty good about myself at this point. We walked over to the family standing in the snow and I handed the mother the bag. Her reply was ""No, I would like cash"" 

I'm sorry, but if you're ""poor and hungry"", you should be more than excited that someone would go out of their way to buy some essentials, or even accept it for the children, because the children definitely looked like they have been missing more than a few meals recently. She, on the other hand, did not. I set the bag down next to the children, said Merry Christmas and went on my way. I watched her eat the candy out of the bag and set the rest next to her. Luckily, my children aren't quite old enough to realize what happened and still think we did a good thing. I will continue to let them think that.

TIFU by trying to help a family who claimed they were poor and hungry, found out only the children are (probably) hungry and were being used to get cash."
2dimkv,non_TBI,"Last night I crawled into bed and was having trouble falling asleep, I was just laying there staring at the ceiling trying to calm my internal chatter when I hear a slight rhythmic squeaking coming from my smokin hot female neighbor's room above mine. Knowing that she occasionally has male visitors over, which I have enjoyed hearing her groan from before, I started listening more intently. After a bit I hear some very slight moaning accompanying the steady squeak. 


Living in an apartment with paper thin walls, I knew that she was the only one home and surmised that she was in fact masturbating. Hot! So I start to get turned on and proceed to give me self a tug. She never really wavers in intensity, just staying quiet yet mostly even, rhythmically. 


I'm fantasizing seeing her fingering herself and moaning while I lead myself to orgasm and finish feeling rather satisfied. I lay there in post ejaculate comfort and note that she's still going, still the same steady rhythm. Mmmm I'm loving this still! So I lay there listening for a bit, close my eyes and try to sleep once more. 


After a little while I hear her get up and go to the kitchen. But... I still hear the squeaking and the moaning....While she's in the other room. 


I open my eyes with confusion and for the first time note that the sounds aren't all coming from directly above me, the squeaking is, but the moaning sounds like it might be coming through my open bedroom door in fact....


So I get up and creep out slowly from my bedroom to find the source of the 'moaning'. As I walk out of my room the sound gets a bit louder and more localized and...familiar....


I then finally notice that this moaning is actually my cat, lying on the couch fast asleep, snoring. 


After a moment realizing my idiocy I go back to bed and also note that I've heard the squeaking before, on other hot nights such as this: a rotary fan in her bedroom.


TL;DR I jerked off to my cat snoring

EDIT: Whoa! Glad you all enjoyed my awkward wank. This is completely true although I don't have much of a way to verify. [This is my cat](http://i.imgur.com/mAvAQwv.jpg) Also, no I'm not a lonely creep, it's kind of a fact of life living in shoddily constructed apartments that you can hear everything, so why not enjoy it? Wouldn't this kind of be the same as watching porn without video, being a total stranger and all? She also gives quite a loud vocal performance when she's got a guy over, and knowing how sound *penetrates* her apartment as well, I'm not sure she cares. As for the fan, just a guess, seemed to fit the requirements. Maybe it's a vibrator....C'MERE KITTY KITTY KITTY

EDIT2: Gold?! GOLD! Thank you kind feline enthusiast! 


Still^waiting^for^Vagetables"
3643i6,non_TBI,"This happened around 9 years ago now, but is probably the most embarrassing thing that I have ever done. 

The premise was ordinary enough, I wanted to ask the girl I had a huge crush on out on a date. I gave her a call and no answer. That's  fine, I'll just leave a message saying I called and I would call her back.

Like most teenage boys, I was super nervous, and because of this I wanted to make sure the voice mail message was perfect. Not too interested, not too uninterested. This was easy enough as I could start leaving a message and if I didn't like it I could delete it and rerecord. Easy enough.


Another thing I should note; when I get up the courage to do something I talk to myself. I try to psych myself into it, saying things like ""come on man, you got this"" or ""no big deal, stay calm""


About half way into the 7th or 8th try into the voicemail I'm startled by a voice that I will never forget


 *Mailbox full. Goodbye* and then a click.


...


It was at that point to my horror I realized that although I was pressing the restart button, I had to first hit a different key to enter the menu for the restart to take place. I didn't start my message over 8 times. Instead I left one obscenely long message comprised of me starting over again and again with phrases in between that talked about how I needed a good message because I liked the girl so much.


I wish I could say at this point I never saw her again, but I was young and stupid and tried to convince myself it wasn't so bad. It would be several more months before I realized she wasn't playing hard to get. The memory however lives on.



Edit: several people are asking about what happened afterwards. It's not very interesting. She was always one of those people who tried her best not to make people feel bad and so it was never directly brought up and she tried to ignore me. The end of me having a crush on her actually occurred when I finally confronted her and made her tell me she didn't like me. It made her feel super uncomfortable but at least I got closure and we both finally got to feel awkward. Or something."
39xio9,non_TBI,"2 Edit 2 Furious: [*OP delivers*](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3a0z1g/tifupdate_on_forgetting_my_trousers_for_an_exam/)

As you may or may not be aware, it's exam season here in the UK, and us year 13s (grade 12s, to translate) are off school, permanently, unless we have to be on-site for an actual paper.

Today (yes, today, bonus points) was chemistry, unit 5. Transition metals and nitrogen chemistry, tricky stuff.  
Sadly, my fuck-up has nothing to do with benzenesulfonic acid.

A little backstory: I've been cycling a lot recently (shout out to /r/bicycling), and I recently managed to get to and from my school 10 miles away. I decided cycling to school *for my exam* would be a fun thing to do.

I wasn't late, if that's what you're thinking.

I slung my school clothes over the back of my chair in the morning, got into my biking stuff, had seven cups of coffee, stared blankly at the past paper I'd left out to do in the morning, and browsed /r/spaceporn for a bit.

The 46-minute bike ride was hot, sweaty, and invigorating (much like my weekends /s), so I arrived knackered, but in high spirits.

Ordering a fifteenth cup of coffee, I moved myself into one of the toilet cubicles to have a [Lynx](http://images-its.chemistdirect.co.uk/lynx-apollo-xl-deodorant-bodyspray.jpg?q=95&o=Mi9rBG4GLTPI4Llta8tCU%40rZfkwj&V=aQCk&w=800&h=800) shower and change into my suit.

No suit trousers.  
*Shit.*

To cut what is already a long story short, I ended up having to do the exam in a black suit jacket, shirt and tie, smart shoes, and black cycling shorts.

I am currently waiting on a photo that one of my teachers took on his iPhone between breaths of laughter, so I'll post that if this gets any form of attention.

TL;DR: You know the nightmare you have of forgetting your trousers when you go to school? That happened.

Edit: I can't believe this got to the front page. Cliche, I know, but in the midst of exam stress, this has really put a smile on my face! I'd like to [especially](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/39xio9/tifu_by_cycling_to_school/cs7k45g) thank /u/Arathorth, and everyone else who took the time to comment!

Onto the stuff you *want* to hear.

The photo was taken by one of my heads of year, while the other one was laughing his head off after I walked into their office and said ""I've made a terrible mistake"". I've emailed him and asked for the photo, and sent him a link to this post for good measure, but I don't expect a reply till tomorrow. I'll update here and probably make another post just for good measure (I don't get any karma from this, sadly...)  
*OP will deliver!!*

I'm saying this all now because I'm going off to bed. I have OCR Electronics tomorrow morning, so I need my shut-eye.

3slfzl,non_TBI,"This was over a year ago but I am still reminded of it almost every day. I am a database programmer and one day I was working on a project where our customers can upload a profile picture to their account. So I am going through the existing database stored procedures and I find one called spUploadMemberImage. It takes two parameters; a member id and an image object. Perfect! To humor myself I found a picture of [Oscar Gamble](http://i.imgur.com/Y2M5fPr.jpg) (a baseball player from the 70's and 80's with the greatest afro in history). So I run the stored procedure, it shouldn't take more than a second or two. Well, after about 10 seconds I start getting nervous. Finally, it says ""execution successful, 77,000 records updated"". OH HOLY SHIT. Every customer picture is now Oscar Gamble. Every button on the restaurants point of sale system is Oscar Gamble. All the buttons that used to be a hot dog, or coke, or whatever is now Oscar Gamble. The thing is, on the POS screen it zoomed in the image so you couldn't see the whole picture, just a close up of his face. Our users start calling our help desk freaking out about an Obama virus. Customers are upset when they login to their account and see a picture that is obviously not theirs. Took me about 2 hours to get everything back to normal and everyone had a good laugh. Pictures and mentions of Oscar Gamble still float around the office pretty frequently.



**Edit:** thanks for the gold! 
Also, my co-worker just sent me a screenshot he took of one of the POS screens that shows the ""Obama virus"" in action. http://i.imgur.com/WgMMNWw.jpg"
3yd4ji,non_TBI,"This happened a year or two ago, but I have only recently discovered this oh so glorious subreddit, and deemed this story reddit worthy.

This story occurs in Florida. This has a little bearing to the situation, because in Florida, the tidal pools are made the ocean washing over large divots in the sand and the receding tide, leaving large pools of water only a foot deep that little children love, and parents feel comfortable leaving there children in. That is, before I enter the story. It was the afternoon and I was hanging out with a few of my friends, surf fishing. One of my friends catches a bonnethead shark, and one of the larger ones I've seen at around 4 foot 3 inches (that's 1.3 meters for you non-muricans.)As a kid, I remember I always enjoyed seeing what the fishermen brought in when they were surf-fishing, and a few of my friends agreed that it would be appropriate to take the shark in a large bucket we had to show the children. So I scoop up some seawater, unhook the shark, and run off to the tidal pool teeming with children from the ages 2 to 4. As I near the tidal pool, the shark seemingly decides its uncomfortable and shifts around, and I, not paying attention to my footing, trip and drop a 4 foot shark into the kiddy pool. The shark instantly starts swimming off into the deeper parts of the tidal pool, and I move faster than I ever have yelling at the top of my lungs, ""THERES A SHARK IN THE TIDAL POOL THERES A SHARK IN THE TIDAL POOL!!!!!"" Mothers grab their children, babies are crying, and I'm dashing around in a foot of water trying to grab a bonnethead shark. I eventually managed to scoop it up in a net and get it back into the bucket, and then to the ocean. I decided to leave earlier than I had planned after receiving all manner of dirty looks from the mothers.
TL;DR I caught a small shark and went to show it to the kiddies when I tripped and dropped it in their tidal pool."
3de5jl,non_TBI,"This happened about 3 hours ago when I showed up to work and clocked in. My boss happened to be getting water, and asked me about my iPhone because he wants to make the switch from his Android. He was asking some general questions, and I was showing him some of the differences. Then I let him hold my phone to get a feel for it and play around with the layout. Being as I just rolled out of bed 30 minutes prior, I didn't think much would come of this. Then I saw him touch the messaging app. He wanted to see the layout of texts and see how to send a new one. Unfortunately for me, my most recent messages were all about cannabis, and me hitting up a couple small time dealers looking for a little sack. Of course, he clicked into the top conversation and the last message was from my friend which read ""I had to run to the store, so in-case you arrive while I'm gone the front door is unlocked and I left the weed on the counter, just leave the cash."" (if I knew how to upload a screenshot of the conversation, I would. I'm still new to this and mainly a lurker) He glanced at me, gave a sly smile, and handed me my phone back. (I enjoy smoking once in awhile, and needed to relax a bit from the stress of work. Only problem, I live in Idaho) I received an email from him about 20 minutes ago saying I needed to meet with him at 4, which is right before we clock out. 


TL;DR - I let my boss use my phone, he saw a message about me buying weed, and now I have a meeting right before the end of the day which probably means I will be fired.


Edit: When I walked in, he asked me to sit down and was pretty serious. He chewed my ass for a bit, citing that he saw the message and that he doesn't want to see me go to jail over a text and that if anyone else saw it I would have been fired. He told me that because it was incidental, he wasn't going to do anything about it and told me that if he ever caught me high at work I would be fired on the spot. Then he starts smiling, and says he enjoys a good toke as well. Told me his kids and wife are out of town for the week, and invited me over for, as he put it, ""elk tenderloin, whiskey, and a joint"". So here I am, about to roll a joint and head to my boss's house for a dank ass dinner. If he lets me get a picture of dinner, I will add another edit with the image. 


Edit 2: just got back from dinner. Trying to respond to everyone . And I really appreciate the gold! One love "
32jqmr,non_TBI,"This actually happened 3-4 years ago when I was in my second year of university. I met an exceedingly handsome man (lets call him Lars) and spent all year trying to move from ""just friends"" to more than ""just friends"" We had quite a lot in common and I thought this guy would be a great boyfriend and I therefore spent most of that year hanging out with him instead of doing my work. I even failed a class because trying to get with him was more important (in my foolish 20 year old mind). So, one night we were hanging out after watching a hockey game and I trying to be cutesy (which I suck at) pass him a note saying I <3 you more than my favourite hockey team (I can't put the team's name because I might give myself away). So Lars takes my note, blushes, and asks if we can go to my dorm room hang out more; I think he is going to confess his feelings for me, so we head up to my room (while I'm grinning like a demented fish). We get to my room, and he tells me that he's gay. 
TL;DR I tried to date a gay guy, ended up failing a course and had to pull 3 all nighters to finish all of my other work."
3jhme3,non_TBI,"So this happened around 10 years ago and I'm using an obvious throwaway account.

In my childhood bedroom there was a heater/humidifier box thing that was about 3x3 feet with black mesh and metal wire around the sides, I'm not sure what it was and I wouldn't dare ask my parents what it was at this point since that would just be odd.

Anyways, me and my sister used to play a game where we took the grill lighter and put it against the side of this air altering box device that was and saw who would hold it there the longest.

One day I held the lighter for a while and then me and her ran off back downstairs. Apparently I had started a slow smolder of the box things mesh since several hours later at night the smoke alarms all began going off, fire trucks are at our house and we get rushed outside to the corner. The flames started in my room and despite my dad closing the bedroom door the flames didn't die out and we watched the flames slowly engulf the house.

Fortunately me and my sister had fallen asleep in the basement so we didn't burn alive in my bedroom.

Nobody had any idea how the fire happened and it was blamed on the heater thing being faulty and having a short circuit of some sort. 

I haven't talked about this to my sister or to my family and think I will just leave this is the dark cobwebs of my life's basement to not mention again.

TL;DR - I used a grill lighter to set a heater on fire in my room which burned my house down. Accidentally."
2h4g18,non_TBI,"DISCLAIMER: **This is a friend's story** and she isn't a redditor but I begged her to let me post it from the perspective that she told the story in. Also I apologize, I'm not a writer.

I am currently a second grade teacher at a public school. I have a wonderful class and I like to reward them when they have a good week by having volunteer parents bring in snacks (I.E. cookies, candy, granola etc.) provided the parent keeps them hypoallergenic. This week our volunteer parent, who we will refer to as Autumn Lily Speaker (not far from her actual name) told me on Wednesday that she will be preparing cookies for the class and is 'excited for this opportunity'. Thinking nothing of it, I thanked her and marked it off my weekly to-do list.

So Friday rolls around and the kids are excited. Autumn Lily Speaker comes into the classroom with a pan full of treats and brings them to me and says with a smile ""I decided you can use these to teach the kids about the woman's vagina today"". Baffled and completely caught off guard I slowly peel the aluminum foil off the pan to behold a plethora of sugar cookie and frosting vaginas. Not just any old vagina, but ALL KINDS OF VAGINAS. There were small, puffy, white, brown, shaved, bald, and even a fire crotch with beef curtains. perplexed I give the parent the most professional look I can muster and quietly reply ""I'm sorry Autumn, but I can't give these to my students. This just isn't appropriate.""

**cue angry radical feminist**

Autumn bursts with the fury of a thousand angry Andrea Dworkin's and starts yelling in front of the class about how 'I should be proud of my vagina' and 'I am settling for a women's role in life'. Utterly bemused and frozen from shock all I can do is stand and stare at the woman as the word 'vagina' is yelled in front of my second grade class about 987,000 times. Finally after what seemed like an eternity, she storms out of the class leaving her vagina cookies on my desk. I scramble to collect my thoughts and take control of the situation before my second graders develop vaginal PTSD. My only thought is to scrape off the vagina frosting and hand out the plain sugar cookies to my students. 

The rest of my day went quite well and ended without a incident. I sent my kiddos home and started wrapping up work and getting ready to leave when the phone rings and a bewildered parent wants to know why their son learned the word 'vagina' in class today I answer the best I can explaining the situation in the most professional manner possible. I get about 3 more phone calls and 4 emails until I get it, the mother of all emails... Autumn's.

**Edit: For clarity, this was a friend, and she took it up with the school's administration who is taking appropriate action**

**Edit2: This is not meant to be an attack on feministic idealism, it just has to do with a single radical feminist who lost her cool. Feminism is about gender equality and shouldn't be grouped with off the wall people like this.**

**Edit3: No longer referring to Autumn as a feminist because she isn't. She's just bat shit crazy**

**Edit4: TIFU by not knowing how to turn off my push notifications for my mobile app.**

**UPDATE!: I got a hold of my friend and asked her a couple questions about the incident so here are the main points.**

* The kid was removed from class by the parent and moved to a private school
* The parent is no longer allowed on district property
* School administration refused to answer whether or not they were taking action
* No pictures were taken of the cookies
* No action was taken against my friend, administration deemed she handled it professionally
* The cookies were actually pretty good"

My daughter was born last week, 10 weeks early. My wife and I have settled into a routine of visiting the NICU every morning. Because I already work remotely, I just use the wifi at the hospital.

Between lack of sleep and too much reddit, I'm starting to get a little foggy brained.

Without thinking, I finish the sentence with ""You fucking retard?""

3lxnzh,non_TBI,"This happened last week but it feels appropriate to still post it here. I like to think I have a pretty good ""Gollum"" impression. I was practicing my Gollum voice at work (I work in tech support, so people are usually on the phones around me so no one hears me being a weirdo) and I was having a skitzo conversation between myself, Gollum, and Smeagol. The three of us were arguing about work when I said something about skinning my co worker (we'll call her Angela) and wearing her hair like a cape in my Gollum voice, only to follow as Smeagol and say 'Quiet! She'll hear us!'. It was at this point I noticed everyone in silence around me. I peered over my cubicle and Angela was there staring at me in utter fear. 3 days later, Angela quit. 

**UPDATE**: Fellow redditor /u/IsThisNew has uploaded a [voice over narrative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsiP9pPCLsU&feature=youtu.be) of this post, and it's hilarious. "
3urmdb,non_TBI,"This fuckup happened when I was approximately four years old; so this didn't happen today at all - in fact it happened in the 1980s, when people didn't know what 'ADHD' was and children like me were quaintly called 'hyperactive', rather than 'Frenetic Hellspawn Tinydemons From Tarterus'.

The story begins with my mother being a teacher - at an 'intermediate school', which teaches kids around the ages of eleven and twelve. The teachers had organised a Christmas shindig just for them and their own kids - and as I recall, it was hosted at the principal's rather large house which had a great back yard for Hellspawn Tinydemons (like myself) to race around in until they exhausted themselves.  
Now in New Zealand, Christmas parties in the 1980s usually involved a lot of sun, a lot of booze and piles of burned meat cheerfully charred by someone's dad on an old brick BBQ. In this case, the booze was beer and cask wine and the casks were being kept under the shade of a trestle table with a big tablecloth thrown over it. The beer of course was in a bin full of ice which slowly turned to slush full of fragments of burned meat and dead mosquitoes.  
Amongst the beer was an assortment of nasty, coloured fizzy drinks for the kids that were 90% sugar.

As a dedicated, chaotic-evil ball of irritation, I had already worn everyone's patience to the nub by being loud, demanding and obstreperous in the extreme. After being given a clip around the ear by my embarrassed mother, I was told to sod off and go annoy the other kids.  
Unfortunately for my slightly drunk and slightly sunstruck mother, I took my main chance to get out from under her watchful eye and look for opportunities for *adventure*.  
The other children ranged from just below my age up to ten years old and finding myself 'outranked' by older, smarter kids, I decided to sulk under the trestle table; which doubled as an awesome blanket fort, due to the oversized tablecloth.  

I should make it clear at this point that at my parent's wedding (not long before this) I had stolen so many shrimps from the shrimp cocktails that I'd thrown up over both my maternal and paternal grandmothers. I also required about three hours sleep a night and was pretty handy with a screwdriver - much to my mechanic father's dismay, who left tools all over the house.  
On this particular occasion, my greediness and cleverness turned to the casks of red wine under the table which I knew were the adult equivalent of fizzy drinks. Figuring out the plastic squeezy spigots things on them, I proceeded to get nicely rubbered.  

This would have been fine if I wasn't also a *social* and *gregarious* child - by seizing my chance to oust the older kids as the 'coolest', I invited the others into my cave of wonders and proceeded to get a bunch of preschoolers and primary schoolers rat-arsed on cheap cask Shiraz.  
Me vomiting red was probably the catalyst for my parents realising Tinydemon had been unleashed at the wrong place/time - promptly followed by other kids chundering crimson into plates of coleslaw, on the trampoline and into their parent's laps.  
Pretty quickly the party was over.  
I don't remember the rest of the afternoon/evening, but apparently it was spent intermittently singing the four-year-old equivalent of drunk karaoke and falling asleep sporadically.  
We were never invited back to the principal's house for parties.

**TL;DR**: got my four-year-old self and a whole bunch of other kids shitfaced at the BBQ of my mother's boss."

Now that we are about to get married, we replaced my queen with her king sized bed and yes, it is glorious. So we had an extra queen with no place to go and I asked my roommate if he'd like to use it; of course, he agreed. So we wash the sheets and move the bed to his room. Fast forward to today and he tells me that his throat is hurting a lot. Rewind three weeks ago and I was huddled in the blankets having the worst case of strep throat I had ever experienced. But we were puzzled, we washed the sheets... until we remember that we didn't wash the comforter because,""...I don't think we need to wash that one.""

3t6cyu,non_TBI,"First time using Tinder. I thought what the heck, might as well try it and see what happens. Fast forward to a few weeks later, I matched up with a very lovely woman and we decided to meet up. We met up at a restaurant in the city. Had a few drinks and a few laughs with some delicious food. 

We also take a stroll around the city having a nice talk and getting to know each other. As the night ended I took her home as her friend dropped her off at the restaurant initially. I parked up in front of her home and was saying goodnight. She asked if I would like to come in side for a bit. I knew I scored big time so I was cheering. As I walked in it seemed like she wasn't living alone. It was a pretty big house. I asked if she lived with anyone and she said she lives with her sister but she's out of town and has the house to herself for a week.

We sat on the couch and eventually one thing led to another. Next thing you know I carry her to her bedroom and she starts going down on me. That is until the door flung wide open with her husband staring straight at both of us. Yes, her husband! I guess he was the sister out of town? He immediately starts charging at me as I stood there helplessly. He hit me with a flew blows and I was swinging back to get him away from me. I dazed him out with two punches to his jawline, push him real hard that he moved out the way and I hit the runner straight to the front door. All this was happening while she (his so called wife) was screaming as us to stop fighting. 

This happened about an hour ago and I currently have a bag of cold peas on my left cheek thinking fuck me. Did I just really ruin a home, I honestly feel pretty awful. I wonder what is happening to her now aye. So long for online dating.

TL;DR. Went on a Tinder date, husband walked in on us, all hell broke loose.

**UPDATE!!!**

As cliche as it sounds I didn't expect this post to become as big as it is now. Many people are calling this story fake but you can say what you want. The deed has been done.. Unfortunately.

I woke up this morning thinking what the fuck. First, recapping of what happened, I actually couldn't believe it. Second, seeing this post blow up on Reddit with great advice from Redditors, it really had me thinking.
I am not going to press charges because in reality, the husband is going through enough already and I wouldn't want anything else to be a greater burden on him. I took them punches like a man and now I just have to deal with it. What I am going to do though is write a letter explaining the whole backstory and leave it in their mailbox with a 12 pack on top of it.

I deleted Tinder and blocked the whores number. I think I should leave the dating game on the side for nowa while and concentrate on myself. I'm just going to have a quiet night to myself tonight and relax hoping this bruise on my face heals quicker than usual.

2wywj1,non_TBI,"I got home from work this evening and was getting ready to go to the gym. A few moments before heading out the door I was opening some snapchats I had received earlier in the day, and just as I was about to exit the application I received one from my cousin (female) who never snapchats me (male), we missed each other in college by about a year so I was kind of excited to hear from her and see what kind of shenanigans she was getting into to these days. 

So at the exact same time that I receive a barrage of texts from her I open up the snapchat to receive full frontal nudity of my dearest cousin. Of course the texts were 
""Do not open that snapchat from me""
""Do not""
""I swear to God do not"" 

I swear these have to be the three fastest consecutive texts in the history of human motion.

I messaged both ""Alice"", and ""Stacy"" this Sunday, on OKCupid. I am a sad lonely man, and I need a ladyfriend. They both happened to respond. Awesome!

I set up the date with ""Stacy"" first. We set it for this Friday, around 415 for coffee. Cool.

Now, if any of you have ever dated online before, you know how often flakes, cancels, fades, and general bullshit happens. 

So as I was still talking to Stacy, I set up a date with Alice. Based on my talking with Stacy, she seemed somewhat reserved and timid, and it felt like a ""1-2 hour"" coffee date kind of thing. So I figured I had time on Friday night to go out with Alice.

Alice and I play some rocket league, set up a date Friday night, everything is groovy.

Fast forward to today. I talked to both Stacyand Alice on/off until today. About 3 hours ago, I receive this message from Stacyon OKCupid:

""Oh my god this is too funny. You should che-""

At this point, I have no idea what the fuck is going on. Then I got a text from Alice...

""-ck your phone""

During this time she started baking cupcakes and cake truffles from our home to sell. I created her a website and got some facebook voucher codes for $50 advertising. I tried using the code on mine but I realised it was only for new advertisers only (I had already promoted my fb page so I wasn't eligible). 

How I fucked up: I texted her this morning to tell her I'm gonna log in with her account because it needs a new advertiser in order for the coupon to work. I start creating an ad and in the background I see her IMing her best friend. She asks my wife if the test came out good or bad. I continue creating the ad and try not to read anything but I read her saying it came out positive. 

At this point I call her and tell her I read it. Apparently she had been planning on a cute way to tell me since we started trying. She had her sister order a shirt so it wouldn't show up in our account since I keep up with that daily. The shirt says ""Big Brother"". She was going to have it delivered to our neighbors so that I didn't accidentally get the package. The shirt was supposed to be delivered today and she was going to have my son wear it when I got home.

46u5d2,non_TBI,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  Today was supposed to be a nice trip to the beach with my boyfriend, Sister and her husband.  For reference my sister and I are 14 months apart in age (she is older) and we look enough alike that more than once in our life people have thought we were twins.  When we were younger we played it up and dressed alike and everything.  As we have gotten older we no longer dress alike however because we both have very thick black curly hair we still style our hair almost the same way.  Today we both had it pulled back in pony tails even using the same scrunchies (lol, totally not planned either).

I say that to say that I honestly believe that my BIL thought I was my sister.  We had rented a cabana that not only had table and chairs but also had two changing rooms.  My BIL and sister had gotten there first and had all of our food set out and my BIL had already changed and was in the water.  My sister was in her bathing suit and said she was going to run up to the restroom before she hit the water.  My b/f forgot his phone so he ran back to the car to get it.  I went into the changing room and had put on the bottom half but didn't have my top on yet and I was bent over looking away from the door when I feel  hands on my hips.

Thinking this was my b/f without looking I grabbed his hand and pulled his hands up to my breast and pressed my butt firmly into his crotch.  I could start to feel the movement of his rapidly awakening erection when I hear my sister yell ""what in the fuck is going on"".  I quickly realize that this is not my boyfriend but my sisters husband and by this time he was no longer halfway up but had a massive erection that was going up my butt (well not really but it pretty much gave me a wedgie).  (side note:   I don't know how my sister can walk)

He let's go of me and he looks confused and starts apologizing profusely to both of us.  Saying he thought it was her, didn't even know we were there yet, etc.   

My sister starts bawling and runs back to the bathroom.  I quickly am putting my top on and wanted to crawl in a hole and die.

I went to the bathroom and tried to talk with my sister but she wasn't having it.  I kept trying to tell her that I thought it was my b/f and he thought it was his wife but the more I tried to explain that the dumber it even sounded to me.

My b/f shows back up and is confused has hell about why everyone is pissed off.  I left my sister to go back to the cabana, my BIL was there and he was pretty much mortified.  He said he was sorry, he though I was her and he hoped I would not hate him for it and that he would never disrespect either my sister or me by doing that on purpose.

I told him he didn't have anything to apologize for any more than I did for grabbing him.  I told him I thought he was my b/f and we both talked about how we were going to help my sister understand that this honestly was a mistake.

She finally came out but by this time she wanted to go home.  I begged her to stay and that I didn't have some long drawn out plan to steal her husband.  I told her I love my b/f and I love her, how could she think I would ever do anything to hurt her.

Ultimately she stuck around but was mopey the rest of the day.  My b/f was finally told what happened and he at first thought it was funny, then when we get to the car he started asking why I thought my BIL was him when he hadn't even changed cloths yet.  Then the rest of drive home was in silence and once we got home he started asking about if I had feelings for my BIL.  Ugh.....

Finally after several hours I got him past his insecurities and am now typing this in bed.

So I have no idea if there is going to be any long term problems from this.  My sister I think still doesn't believe me.  I sure as fuck hope she doesn't take this out on my BIL.  I am hoping things aren't going to be awkward with my BIL either and ultimately I hope my b/f can just forget about this.

Good God what a fucking mess.

tl;dr  While changing into bathing suit BIL comes from behind me and grabs me on hips, me thinking it is b/f pull his hands from hips to breasts and firmly plant buttocks into groin causing erection and problems."
43h0c8,non_TBI,"Obligatory this happened a few weeks ago...

My girlfriend and I went to get sushi- and of course sake bombs- the other night. She was on her period, so to compensate for the lack of sex we decided to drink... A lot.

After a few too many bombs, my girlfriend slammed the bottle onto an unsuspecting couple's table. It was strongly suggested by management that we should leave, so we ventured out into the night.

We got back to my apartment and she started begging me to lay into her. Being the forward thinking man that I am, we laid down a towel and proceeded to make her cry til the cows came home.

Fast forward a week later and my girlfriend is having consistent stomach cramps and feels unwell. Remembering the night of ill-advised passion, we discussed the possibility of leaving the tampon in during sex. She was freaking out and I put on my best deep sea fisher face and tried to hook that bad boy out of her vag. 

Now I have a girlfriend screaming in the bathtub and bloody cotton child laying on the floor of my bathroom while I throw up in the sink.

2nrc0p,non_TBI,"My wife is a flight attendant and she is gone for 4-5 days art a time. We have been married for 24 years and I really miss her when she's gone. We have 3 children, ages 8, 10, and 12. The 8 year old is our only girl. She is a fucking vampire. She likes to sleep late and stay up late. 

Anyway, on Thanksgiving day, my wife flew in and she missed me A LOT! In so many words, she told me what she was going to do to me that night after the kids were in bed. It made ME blush. So around 9ish, we told the kids to brush their teeth and we would read to them a bit then it was off to bed. After reading to them, my wife said, ""You guys get in the bed and don't come downstairs and bother mommy and daddy. We are going to sit on the laptop and do some Christmas shopping for you.""

Well, this made them run upstairs and get right in the bed. We waited about ten minutes and it was sexy time! I won't get into details but let's just say my wife REALLY missed me and was vocal about it. 

About halfway through our sexy time, I hear a knock on the door. We immediately stop what we are doing. We are dead silent, hoping whoever it is will go away. Thirty seconds go by and I hear the sweet sound of my precious 8 year old daughter say, ""Are you guys still Christmas shopping?"" My wife says, ""Yes, we are. Go back upstairs."" My little angel says, ""Well, all I can hear is AHHH AHHH AHHH AHHH!""

Immediately I lose my mojo. End of sexy time."
3ce04c,non_TBI,"I was fresh out of high school, working as a receptionist for a fancy computer firm.  It was my 2nd day on the job and the sales manager approached me and asked if I would announce over the company intercom 'that the Sares meeting is beginning'.  I repeated his request back to him and he said, 'not Sares....Saaaaares'.  No problem - I picked up the phone and proceeded to announce to the entire building that the 'Saaaaares meeting is beginning'.  Immediately I knew IFU because the entire building erupted into laughter.  Turns out the poor bastard had a speech impediment and pronounced his 'L's' as 'R's'.  Sales meeting....not Saaaaaaares meeting

2jj6qu,non_TBI,"Throwaway, because the gf knows my account.

This happened last Friday and I finally got the stains out of the sheets. 

I took the girlfriend out to dinner as a celebratory meal for her finishing school.  A nice meal, two glasses of wine, her cheeks are rosy, she wants to go home.  Ok, no prob.

She was also pretty horny.  So one thing lead to another, I have her all wound up, I slip off her dress and she decides to go down on me.  

You can see where this is going.


I'm lying on the bed full erect and she's got me in her mouth, slowly and sensually going up and down.  The odd quick one and more sucking, shit this is awesome.  

So then she goes way down. -way- down.  And I've never felt that before.  And in my pure moment of body numbing pleasure, with my balls getting that tingly feeling, my hips thrust ever so slightly.


Well that little movement invoked the gag reflex of a full stomach, horny, and fairly drunk college graduate.  

She puked up two glasses of wine, half of a fruit crumble with ice cream, her salmon filet on wild rice, and one quarter of a bun, buttere,d all over my erect penis while it was in her mouth.  All over my balls, in her hair, all over my lap, on my comforter, and a good portion of my sheets.  


Still plan on marrying her though."
3va8wv,non_TBI,"edits: rupees not rubies. Also, I made my front-page! Thanks for all the comments :), I'm about to land but I'll read the rest once I get home. Just got reddit gold from a very kind fellow redditor. Thank you!!

Hey reddit, this just happened to be this week. It’s quite long but I hope you enjoy it. 


I had a trip planned to India and was flying out this past Saturday. A couple of weeks prior I applied for the Indian tourist visa online. It got approved in a couple of days and all was good. I bought plane tickets and booked hotels. I was flying from the US to India with a connection in Germany.


Trip day comes. I exchange a bunch of dollars into Indian Rupees and off we go. I take the 9 or so hour flight to Germany and have an hour or so to get to my next flight. I pass customs in Germany and security. All good. Then there’s this airline counter: “Document check” right after security where they make sure you have all the proper visas and what not to travel to wherever you’re going. I was very careful to print out EVERYTHING and proceed to show all of this to the airline person.


I want to quickly explain how Indian tourist visas work. You apply online with your name, passport info, date of arrival, etc. Once your visa is approved you get an email with your visa confirmation number, your passport number, etc. You print this out and once you get to India you will get the actual visa on your passport. 


Ok, back to the document check module. I’m a bit anxious as my flight leaves soon but I’m past customs and security so I should be good. I show the guy my passport and my printed visa confirmation. He starts flicking through my passport and gets this worried look on his face. Once he’s done he looks up with the saddest expression on his face and tells me he can’t let me go through. The Indian visa requires 2 completely blank pages on your passport and all of mine have something in it. Even if it’s just an entrance stamp from when I’ve arrived to the US, it’s still not completely empty and thus doesn’t count. It starts to sink in that I’m not actually going to be able to board my plane. He tells me to go to the airline service center to see what I can do.


I eventually get there and talk to several representatives. They can’t let me go because I will be turned back once I arrive in India and they will be charged a fine for letting me go in the first place. Also by this time my flight has left. They mention that I can potentially get extra pages added onto my passport in the consulate. My return flight is not until a week later so I decide if I can get new pages quickly enough I can still make it to India and use the same return flight. It’s Sunday and everything is closed so I have to chill for now and call the consulate first thing in the morning. I get a hotel room at the airport and slowly admit defeat. I'm not really expecting to be able to make but still giving it a shot because why not. I cancel what I can for the days I won’t be able to be there.


Monday arrives and my body is completely confused. I’m hit with shittiest jet lag I’ve ever had. I didn’t actually think it was a thing until now. In my head, I’m apologizing to all the people I had silently judged when they complained about being jet lagged. I call up the consulate and they say they can’t give me new pages for my passport but they can give me a whole new “emergency” passport. They ask when I would like the appointment and I simply say: “Can it be right now?”. I train into the consulate, everyone is super nice and effective and I’ve got a new passport within the hour, very impressed. 


It suddenly dawns on me, holy shit, I’m actually going to make it to India! Super excited, I decide to explore the city a bit. Germany is pretty cool, has amazing sausages and pretzels. It’s raining but it doesn’t matter because I’m going to India!! I train back to the hotel and make sure to call the Indian Visa place to make sure my visa is still good if I got a new passport and get the OK from them. Sweet, I book a flight for 2 days from now since I’m not going to make the first city I was going to in India. Might as well stay here and try and fix the jet lag. Next day I’m still super jet lagged and have a horrible time. I still go out and explore the city and end up going to a pretty cool Zoo. I pass out at 8pm and sleep like never before. 


Wake up the next morning refreshed and ready for India. My flight is in 6 hours so I have an epic breakfast, go to the gym, and day dream about eating new food and finally using my Indian Rupees. Same deal, cross customs, cross security and back at the “Document Check” place again. Different guy, and this one is kind of a dick. I show him both my passports and my visa. He does his thing for a bit and then says he can’t let me through. Wutt?? He says that the visa confirmation page I have printed out says my passport number is different that that of my new passport. No shit, I got a new passport but the old one matches and it’s right here with me. I also tell him I called the Indian Visa place to ask this specific thing and they said it was all good. He still won’t budge. He calls his supervisor on the phone and he says no. I ask to speak to his supervisor and he says you can’t but you can speak with the customer service desk of the airline (same place I had gone the previous time). It’s very rare that I get altered or lose my nerve. The only exception is when dealing with cell phone carriers. So I keep my calm. I know I have the facts on my side, and I got plenty of time since I came in early.


I walk over to the customer representatives desk and explain the whole story. This woman get’s it, she’s on my side. She says she just has to get some proof that it doesn’t matter if you get a new passport. She calls the Indian consulate in Germany and they say they’re not sure. I google and find it clearly stated on their website that it’s okay if you have a new passport. She calls the Indian Visa place to make sure and they end up saying that it’s not a problem if you get a new passport and your visa is in the old one as long as you carry both passports with you. HOWEVER, what I had wasn’t a visa. It was a visa authorization and that one is binding to whichever passport you applied with. So my visa authorization is bound to my old passport which has a big “CANCELLED” stamp on it. I’m assuming when I called the Indian Visa place the day earlier, they thought I already had my visa on my passport and I didn’t think to clarify. The lady is super sorry and heart broken for me. I’m done. I’m going home. I lost this one.


Now, I thought this is where it ended. I’m not going to India, I accept that. I won’t be able to eat the food or use my Indian Rupees. Let me just go home. I proceed to grab my checked bags and go to the ticket counter for the airline which was operating my return flight. My return flight was on Sunday (it was now Wednesday) and it went India -> Germany -> US. Great, I can just grab the second flight on Sunday and go back home. Or even better, I might be able to grab the same flight back tomorrow or something. Nope. Apparently if you don’t board the first part of your flight (India -> Germany) our whole trip gets wiped and you can’t board the second one. Furthermore, you can’t just cancel your first flight and be good because it might be more expensive to go from Germany -> US than to do India -> Germany -> US. 


Wut.


This is what they told me anyways. So even if I just chilled in Germany until Sunday, I couldn’t board the flight I had already paid for. So no matter what, I had to pay a changing fee and the difference of the flight or get a completely new flight. I end up changing the flight for the next day at a charge of $500 bucks and booking another room at the hotel in the airport. I was completely defeated at this point. I proceed to stay in my room all day playing video games and ordering room service with wine.


Today I boarded my flight back to the US. I was terrified that now my US visa (I’m not american so I have one of those too) wouldn’t work with the new passport and I would be once again, turned back at the famous “Document Check” module. Luckily, there were no problems. I’m now writing this from the plane as I’m headed home. No India for me.


Total flights lost: 4 + change fees


Thanks for reading reddit.


TLDR; Was headed to India connecting through Germany. Got stuck in Germany because I needed a new passport. Got new passport. Indian visa not valid with new passport. No India.

39vic6,non_TBI,So I'm in my hotel room and go online to check my orientation schedule for tomorrow and see that check-in starts at 7:30 am... next week.
2apvvp,non_TBI,"There's a couple of things you have to know about me for any of this to make sense. Firstly, I went to a small rural high school where everyday knows everybody and there's very little protocol for anything out of the ordinary. Secondly, I had recently had some heart problems, so I had been wearing a heart monitor that alerted me when my heart was beating irregularly. Thirdly, I'm a classic good girl who had never broken a rule in my life. In fact, until that fateful day I didn't even know where the principal's office was. 

So here's what happened. For my physics class, I had to complete a project called ""The Egg Drop Project"". I'm pretty sure this is a common assignment for basic physics classes, but in case any of you don't know what it is allow me to explain. Basically the idea is to drop an egg onto the ground from 20 feet up without the egg breaking. Some people built complicated contraptions while some people just wrap the egg in bubble wrap and let that sucker fall. I decided to put my egg into a small box, fill the box with cotton balls, and close the box with duct tape. Now, my physics class was my last class of the day, so I decided to just set it inside the class room, put my name on it, and come back for it later. I thought that would be fine because I left projects in random classrooms all the time and no one ever messed with any of them. However, this time was different. Someone found my project and thought it would be funny to open up the classroom window and set it outside. I guess they thought that I would walk into the classroom, freak out because I couldn't find it, and then we'd all have a good old laugh about it. Wrong. So wrong. Apparently a student was arriving late to school and noticed a small, cardboard box just chillin' outside of the building and decided to go tell the main office about it. 

So there I was, minding my own business, sitting in my 4th hour class, when a rushed, slightly panicked announcement came over the loud speaker. They called my name and asked me to come to the office. Immediately. I was already freaked out because I had never been called to the office before. But honestly I just assumed I had forgotten something at home that my mom was dropping off. When I got to the main office all of the secretaries were just staring at me. They all looked oddly pale, and they were not saying anything at all. I asked them if I had a package or something, and one of them just pointed to the principal's office and told me that they were expecting me. Okay. Weird. I was getting really nervous, but I didn't want to ask questions so I just went in anyway. I entered the room and there was my principal, my vice principal, and my egg drop project just sitting on the desk. I sat down across from them and I honestly didn't know what to think. The feeling in the room was so tense. No one said anything for so long and just when I couldn't take it anymore the principal said, ""This was found by a student outside of the physics classroom. It has your name on it. We have called the police and they're on their way. We need you to tell us right now... is this a bomb? Do you have a detonator on your person? And if it is, in fact, a bomb I need you to tell us how to disarm it."" I was shocked. I honestly didn't know if I should laugh or scream. Looking back on it now, it is absolutely ridiculous that a box containing an egg and bag of cotton balls could cause so much drama. But at the time I was scared out of my mind. I was getting ready to explain everything and apologize when the worst possible thing that could have ever happened actually happened. *beep* *beep*. My heart monitor. It had registered my nervousness and increased heart rate. It was dead silent in that room except for the sound of that beeping. All three of us just stared at each other, not moving, not even breathing. It started slowly and quietly, every second getting louder and faster until it actually sounded like a full-out action movie explosion countdown. The two grown men in front of me began to panic. One of them grabbed the intercom system and screamed ""**EVERYBODY GET DOWN, WE'VE GOT A BOMB IN THE BUILDING!**"" The other one grabbed the box and kind of just ran around the room with it. Meanwhile, I was yelling at them trying to explain that it wasn't a bomb and the beeping wasn't me trying to set it off. The whole thing probably only lasted 10 seconds, maybe less. But the panic in the room mixed with the screams from the secrataries outside made it feel like everything was in slow motion. When I got my wits about me I grabbed my monitor and pulled it off of my body. The beeping stopped, and they finally calmed down enough to hear me say, ""IT'S NOT A BOMB IT'S AN EGG IN A CARDBOARD BOX AND I HAVE FUCKING HEART PROBLEMS."" 

Eventually, I explained everything. We didn't exactly laugh about it, but I got to go home for the rest of the day. So that was cool. Also everyone at school knew me as the girl who brought a bomb to school, and I made it into the graduation speech. So at least I have that going for me. 

**TL;DR: Having heart problems is, in fact, NOT da bomb.**

**Edit: Okay. Quite a few of you are wondering why they would bring the box into the building if they thought it was a bomb. And honestly I wondered the same thing. The only thing I can come up with is that because my school was so small and they knew I was a good kid they didn't actually believe it was a bomb. If that's the case then they probably just planned on bringing me in so I could confirm that it was just a harmless egg in a box. They did end up changing their entire policy after this incident, and they added a bomb threat drill.**

**Edit 2: Reading through the comments (especially the ones who so kindly and respectful shared their opinion that this post is 'bullshit') has really shown me that people have no idea what's going in small towns like mine. It's not uncommon for people to bring weapons into the school. People have pocket knives attached to their backpacks and rifles in their vehicles. That's just the way it is. I don't actually care if people beleive my story or not, but the point is this shit happens all the time. It's not super unusual.*


Edit 3: Sorry I'm editing so much, but I want to answer the most common questions! 

1. The egg DID survive, but the police took the box away. So I had to remake it. I eventually got all the points on my project. :)

2. Pretty much it was common knowledge who put the box outside, but he didn't get in trouble. I think everyone involved was just embarrassed and they wanted to put the whole thing behind them. 

3. I appriciate all the concern about my heart! I'm alive and well. I have neurocardiogenic syncope, and I'm taking medicine that pretty much allows me to live normally!"
3u4rwn,non_TBI,"So I had a super shitty day at work today (and I usually love my work). It dragged on and on and on... finally after 15 hours of stuff I hate to do I crawled home. One thing that kept me somewhat cheerful is the thought of my girlfriend making dinner for me. She is an amazing cook so I was really looking forward to it. 

I get home and make my last call for today while she whips up dinner. She calls me, I sit down, pretty dead by that point, and she shoves a pot of something in front of me. I take a fork and eat it. 

Wow-omg, it's spicy noodles submerged in some sort of delicious soup! I had one sandwhich this entire day, and the noodles taste unbelievably fucking incredible to me. I devour them and with all but tears in my eyes tell my girlfriend this is the best thing she ever made, I am absolutely amazed, she should make this every week. Then I notice she's just sorta... staring at me. 

At this point I look down and realize what I am eating. It's fucking instant noodles from a dollar store, still in that freaking plastic bowl they come in. 

Apparently, I was braindead enough to: 

* crave instant noodles;
* wander into 24 hour store, buy instant noodles;
* thrust them into my gf's hands and inform her I don't want any of the steak and salsa she was planning to make, but in fact I want instant noodles
* having no recollection of the above, eat instant noodles and act like it's a god's gift to earth. 

Kids, don't let this become your life

**EDIT**: since this is still getting replies, might as well clear some stuff up. 

I actually got some sleep (since, you know, this post is 20 hours old). Not as much as I would have liked to but what can you do. 

My girlfriend did not, in fact, dump me on the spot, or banish me to the couch. She is a lovely and very understanding woman. 

I did not drive home. 

I eat my steak rare with no condiments, save occasional red wine sauce. Salsa makes for a mad side dish tho. 

My working hours are usually somewhat shorter (~12) and comprised mostly of stuff that I love to do. So no thanks, I don't need a new job. ~~I do however need more money~~

Also, people from the top thread, I meant reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/all/new/, but fuck if I know what actually happened to /r/new

Also, I am female, but didn't feel like correcting every single lovely person in the comments for making the standard reddit assumption

2jwdez,non_TBI,"Technically yesterday I fucked up, but whatever.

To set the scene, I was flying back from a business trip to France the morning after a long night of vaguely business-related drinking. I arrived at Charles de Gaulle at an absolutely unholy hour of the morning and got ready to board my flight and return to the USA. I was miserably hung over and stopped in an airport restaurant for some breakfast.

Somehow, my still-half-drunk mind decided it would be a good idea to get eggs benedict and a Duvel. A word to the wise: never under any circumstances eat airport eggs benedict. If for some incomprehensible reason you must eat airport eggs benedict, don't wash them down with an early-morning beer. 

As I staggered onto the plane a bit later, my stomach started churning pretty aggressively. I found my seat, grunted a hello to the cheery-looking French family sitting next to me/on my row, and settled in with noise-cancelling headphones and some music.

A little ways into the flight, my stomach turned traitor completely. Taking a shit in an airplane bathroom is one of the more miserable things in the world, so I resigned myself to a transatlantic journey's worth of intestinal discomfort. Then the farts started coming. One, then another, then another, unrelenting waves trying to fight through a bottleneck; the gaseous equivalent of the Persians at Thermopylae. 

I kept them silent, but they kept coming. I felt for the rest of the plane, smelling these horrid drunk airport eggs benedict farts. At least, I thought, they wouldn't know it was me. It went on like this for the entire flight, a 6-hour parade of vile but silent farts every 10 or 15 seconds. Then we started the landing.

I started to let out a fart as an announcement came over the PA. I pulled off my headphones to listen. Suddenly, to my horror, as I pulled off the noise-cancelling headphones the ""silent"" fart turned seat-shakingly loud. I put the pieces together and shrank deeper and deeper into my seat as I did. *holy shit... that means... the entire flight... oh fuck no* 

I slunk out of that airplane without making eye contact with a single soul. 

TLDR: Made questionable food choices and released what I thought were silent hangover farts to an entire airplane for 6 hours because I forgot my noise-cancelling headphones cancelled noise.

EDIT: holy shit, front page of reddit and gold. Thanks, strangers!

Also to the ""go take a shit"" crowd, many years of experience with my own stomach make me highly confident that this was not a one and done thing, taking a shit would have reduced my personal discomfort but I'd just have been the constantly farting guy who kept making everyone move so I could shit every half hour. That being said, yes, all the decisions I made in this story were bad decisions. I blame free booze and sleep deprivation. Also myself. Yeah, mostly myself."
35tkl9,non_TBI,"Before going into the story itself I have to give a bit of background. One of the important part of my work is going to professional conferences, parties or trade shows. It's a fairly small world so I end up meeting the same 100 people at least once a week in a social setting (think open bar and free food). 
Naturaly after a few years like that you start making aquaintances/drinking friends, especially among the few people among my age. 
One of these people is a cute young lady with whom I share a passion about videogames, and we usually chat about that while hitting the bar. All in all just a friend. 

Last night we met at a party where SO where also invited and where I met her boyfriend of a few years (who she wanted to marry) I introduce myself and then she and I start to chat about our latest favorite game (Pillars Of Eternity for those wondering). After some time I go to the bar to grab a few glasses for me, her and her BF (yay free champagne) and when I come back a couple minutes later said boyfriend is throwing a tantrum about ""how she's looking at me"" an then storms off shouting that it's over between them. I then proceed to my friend that has become a teary meldown and put her into a cab to go back home. 

I then proceed to my own place and proceed to my daily skype session my own girlfriend (long distance sucks guys). I tell her what just happenned to the party, and she then starts to act coldly and ends the session quite fast. I then woke up this morning to a text telling me that she's breaking up with me because ""where there's smoke there's fire, you were obviously hitting on her"". 

So I'm now single and the single positive fact of the day is that me and my newly single friend are going to hit the bars tonight to get wicked drunk (we both need it). 

TL/DR : Crazy jealous BF breaks up with my friend because he thinks she's into me. My own GF proceeds to break up with me because she thinks I did something wrong. Gonna get wicked drunk tonight.

Update : Too much beer, too much shots. The hangover is strong. Nothing happened, this was not some damn romcom. :'D"

 turbobomb is that you?"" And i respond . I walk out of the bathroom to meet a very annoyed nurse looking at me with a grin and tells me ""i told you to keep your pulse down"", and than walks away. And i leave standing there with a face red as a tomato in shame.
TL;DR: jerked off in a hospital bathroom and a nurse got angry.

46l09a,non_TBI,"So, like most TIFUs, this was not actually today. About two weeks ago, I picked out a small local sushi place in Ginza to go get a bite while I was there on vacation. Unfortunately, it was closing as I arrived, so I Googled 'sushi near me' and picked from the list at random. I landed on a place nearby, about 5 mins, called 'Sushiko Honten'. It took a while to find - it was a small recessed door with no sign, somewhat shady - but once I entered it was lovely.

After eating some of the best sushi I've ever had, I noticed there were no prices on the menu. I'd had about 8 plates of sushi at this point, and started to panick a little. I quickly Googled the restaurant and blanched at what I found. The restaurant was 120 years old and had one Michelin star. As quickly as I could, I asked for the bill.

¥20 000 ($150) later, I decided to thoroughly research any future restaurants I visited on a whim. And not to use data in Japan. That was another 50 USD.

Edit: To clarify why this was so expensive, there were 2 pieces of nigiri sushi per plate, no rolls."
33hxts,non_TBI,"This happened a few years ago, but when you really think about it, WHAT IS TIME? 

Anyway, I had just handed in a big assignment for my teacher training degree, it was a Friday, so I went out and had a nice time. The next day I hung out with friends and I was in a cocky mood. I had a small class workshop to give on the Monday, but I was getting the hang of this teaching lark and I wanted to let my hair down for a change. My friends decided to take some LSD that night and, having done other drugs before, I thought it would make me feel a bit funny, have a giggle with my mates, go to sleep, and that'd be that. I took some (it turned out to be a lot). We were sitting around watching music videos, and I remember, as we were watching [Slow by Kylie Minogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omrp4QR_Rpo), her eyes started to resonate with different colours, and I started laughing at how beautiful she was. We then just hung out, the space of the room became gigantic, lying down made my sense of gravity make me feel like I was on a rollercoaster. Listening to people talk made your mind immerse in their sentence, their words altering your whole perception. Also when I crossed my legs they felt like they were intertwined, like [that bit in the Mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLZQ_xQEHGY&feature=player_detailpage#t=136). Suddenly it's 4am, everyone had gone to sleep, and all had become dark, in more ways than one. I thought I could hear my friend crying and that the trees outside were hands clawing at the window. The core of my intelligence knew that this was all imaginary, and took a detached, intrigued stance on the whole thing. Emotionally though I was fucked, and didn't get any sleep. The next day, due to lack of sleep and my new role as a drug fiend, my mind had completely gone, and I was worrying it wouldn't heal quick enough for the lesson, and this worry made it worse. It reached its nadir when, because my teeth had become numb, my tongue felt like it was feeling around the inside of a skull, which technically it was. Then I realised in the end my body was just made of nerve and bone, and my mind was an organ held inside a very fragile box. Good times.

Anyway, I managed to get a bit of sleep, despite spending most of the night in the fetal position googling whether my mind was broken, and whether I might die. The next day I met all my coursemates at the school we were doing a class for. The minitrips were erratic and less intense, but still very much there. Suddenly I'm standing in the classroom, centre stage, with my coursemates watching. The kids came bounding in, innocent, curious, complete. It was at this point that my intelligence core said to me ""you're about to teach a class of kids, and you're on LSD"", in the same way that a horrified Jesse turned to Walt and asked, ""did you just bring a bomb into a hospital"". I kept rubbing my numb face and staring at the carpet pattern, which made me feel nice. The lesson was demonstrating that cardboard prisms of different geometries could hold different weights. I demonstrated that the cylindrical cardboard could hold the most weight, which seemed to make some of the kids trip out as much as me. One of the kids asked whether a perfect cylinder would hold an infinite weight, which made my heart rate spike because I was expecting my mind to implode under its own imagination and exhaustion. I kept losing track of how many kids there were, I thought one of the kids had a copy of himself, and images of hands clawing at the windows kepts flashing up. I knew it wasn't real, and I just kept viewing myself from outside, trying to act normally, which wasn't hard because as I discovered the previous day, all I am is just an organ in a skull. I was absolutely petrified I was going to end up on the front page of a tabloid and/or in prison by the evening. A few of my coursemates thought I was acting a bit weird, but I got through the rest of the day by saying I was ill, and they were all thinking about their lessons too much to care that much, thank christ.

TL;DR, achieved learning objectives despite hands clawing at the windows and kids copying themselves

EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold and all the lovely comments. Rest assured there was never any risk to the kids, please don't forget that teachers always do an incredible job of safeguarding etc. I'd take a bullet for any one of my little buggers :)"
3xlav9,non_TBI,"Still quite fresh, happened yesterday night but has been taking place for the past year. 

Short(-ish) backstory, (at that time) I was a 27 y/o bi guy, dating this girl for about a year, she lived with her dad at the time so whenever I would go over her dad and I would shoot the shit, watch sports, play videogames and we became decently good friends. 

Turns out while we were dating she was cheating on me, so during our ""break"" her dad texts me and sees if I was alright and if I wanted to go for a drink. She still lives with him so we went to a bar nearby, and continued being friends like she didn't exist. We knock back a few too many, stumble back to his home (drinking and driving is bad kids!) and I drop him on his bed, and end up passing out myself. Wake up after a few hours, to find myself being spooned up to him; panic; wake him up in the process. Embarrassing silence follows, and then he leans over and kisses me. Turns out I'm not the only bisexual in the room, and we end up doing the nasty. 

Fast forward 2 months, he and I are still seeing each other, his daughter and I are not, but no one knows about him and I. His daughter moved in with her new bf and he invited me over since she was gone. We were just hanging out and playing games, I go to get a another beer for us come back to find him down on one knee with a ring. Fate has it, his daughter forgot something and opens the door right at the moment with new bf in tow. Shit hits the fan, she starts screaming obscenities, he panics and tries to calm things down and I walked over, pick up the ring and put it on. Hell hath no fury like that of a woman whose dad I'm now engaged to. She starts screaming even more, her bf decides punching me is the best option, and thankfully my days in Judo haven't completely been forgotten. I throw him out of house, dad tells daughter to get out and slams door in her face. She runs off, and tells the whole world on FB, calls his family and mine. His family is pissed at him, my (very Indian) family is livid with me and right now I just hope she gets hit by a goddamn meteorite!


TL;DR- Dated a girl, befriended father, broke up with cheating girl, slept with her father, now engaged to him, shit hits the fan and neither family is happy!

EDIT: OK this was/is my first reddit post ever, did NOT expect the crazy amount of responses. Here I'm thinking it'll get lost in the swell that is the Internet. Thank you for the support/advice/whatever else this was just me venting and it's become wayyyyyy more than that now. Also, I have no fucking clue what reddit gold is but thank you to the kind soul who donated/bought that. Please don't give me more, I don't know what to do with it :/
Q&A
To answer some of the questions posted or just clear some stuff up. 
- he's 42, I'm 29, she's 24. He had her when he was 18. 
- he's divorced, so he's not cheating on anyone, I wouldn't allow that given that's what happened to me. 
- I did not put on the ring out of spite, I was going to say yes anyway, with or without her barging in. 
- he's Canadian (Italian) and I'm the from-India-Indian kind of Indian . 
- he's not overly thrilled with me venting on here, so I won't be posting pix anytime soon. Maybe once things, and he,  calm down. 

EDIT2: Holiday season was bonkers busy, so didn't get a chance to update. We have decided to move in together, my place not his old place. My extended family (cousins et al) are talking to me again, the younger ones couldn't give a fuck about my sexuality, the older ones are tiptoeing around it. My parents are ... my parents, they are concerned blah blah blah, they don't understand (but so-and-so's daughter is sooooo pretty, and a doctor) but they realize they can't huff and puff and expect me to go running back to their side. His family, typical Italian, don't get it or don't want to. Except for one brother and one sister, he's essentially cut off and it crushes me, but he said they'll come around and I certainly hope so. 
Also, for the people hung up on the judo thing, judo has very little to do with punching and kicking and is mostly grappling, throwing, and submissions. I used to be a purple belt nikyuu (junior rank), before I immigrated to Canada
He's also severely against his picture being online, so no pic but once I get him a ring we'll put up a pic of the rings.
"
2x1u46,non_TBI,"This happened around Christmas.  A gay couple I am friends with invited me to their house party.  I am a straight 29/m, they are middle aged.  They had also invited about 2 dozen other gay men from around town.  I didn't know anyone else there.

After I arrived, I tried to mingle with the other guests.  One was about to tell a raunchy story, but acknowledged that he didn't know me.
""Before I start, are you family?""
Not knowing what this meant, I thought he was asking if I would be offended by gay stories.
""Yeah, I'm family, go right ahead!"" I replied.  His eyes grew wide.  I was now the young new guy at the party, and everyone wanted to get to know me.

All night long everyone was over the top nice to me, and naively I thought they were just being welcoming to the newcomer in their midst.  Until at the end of the night, one of them started hitting on me.  When we realized my mistake, we all had a laugh, but I had about 20 new Facebook friend requests the next morning.  What's more, because I had just ended things with my live in girlfriend the week before, my host friends had thought I was coming out too, and were planning on making a celebratory announcement until it was stopped at the last minute.

Embarrassing mistake, but I will have a funny story out of it at least!"
2k10dn,non_TBI,"There's an extension that converts any appearance of ""cloud"" on a webpage to ""butt"". I work in web development and as such am exposed to a lot of marketing copy about How To Use The Cloud To Disrupt Your Business Vertical and the like. I installed this extension on chrome on my home computer, not my work computer, but didn't realize that Chrome will sync your extensions across all logged in browsers.

So one day at work, I'm asked to take a look at a bug in a weather forecast script in the sidebar of a news website that my company manages. I open up the script (which is annoyingly only accessible in-browser through the CMS), fix the bug, and get back to my other projects.

The next day, the newspaper editor stops by and asks me to take a look at the weather forecast cause it's ""acting strange."" Long story short, approximately 6,000 area residents were informed that the weather in their county today would be ""Butty with light rain in the evening."""
2rjtqy,non_TBI,"This actually took place over the course of a few months. We drive to see my girlfriend's grandmother a lot on weekends. The grandmother lives in a different state and it gives the girlfriend and I a lot of time in the car together. Being a pretty boring drive, we usually help time go by by having karaoke parties, playing the alphabet game (race from A-Z finding words that start with the next letter on signs), or arguing about whodunnit in Serial. Being such a long drive (about 6.5 hours one way), we of course hold hands occasionally. Cute boring stuff. Well, usually we'll say ""I love you"" as we hold hands and I got it in my head on one trip that I'd mess with her. 

It started with me putting my hand on her knee, giving it a light squeeze and saying, ""I love you."" She'd respond likewise and we'd continue. I'd do this a couple times each way. Then I began to do it when we're on the couch watching something or just in general sitting next to one another. Not too often, but enough to form a habit. Then I started to just squeeze her leg. My plan worked perfectly. Without realizing it she'd look at me, flash that great beam of a smile and tell me she loves me. For a few weeks I enjoyed a game that only I knew we were playing, chuckling to myself in satisfaction. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. It was just too good. I had to tell her.

This was a mistake.

She couldn't believe she didn't notice it for so long and wonders what else I'm doing to mess with her. Now when I squeeze instead of saying she loves me I get scowl and an eye roll. But eventually she does still say it.

TL;DR: 
My lovely Pavlovian belle,

loved my touch and all was swell,

Until I did sing,

Now when the bell rings,

All I hear is ""Go to hell""

Edit: Since so many have asked, MsRyael is not in fact the gf."
2pi6j0,non_TBI,"So I recently got the Samsung Galaxy S5.  All in all, I've been pretty happy with it.  

Anyway, I'm home from college for winter break. Being the bum that I am, I wake up today around noon, shower, eat, and decide it's nap time. Hey, I'm an adult. I do what I want.

I get back into bed, tuck myself into a taco, and turn on a meditation soundtrack. Now I don't typically use these, but I figured why not.  I find one with a male voice, speaking in a slightly seductive, soothing English accent.  Okay, I can work with this.

And I have to say, this soundtrack had me passed out within minutes.

Mid-nap, I get an email notification, vibrating my bed and blinding me with the bright screen.  I reached out in a daze, clicked the power button a few times in quick succession, and re-tacoed myself in the blankets.

Not a minute later, my phone rings. Ugh, I grab my phone and before I can speak, I hear my frantic father yelling ""heydandelion, HEYDANDELION!""

But since I live in the middle of bumblefuck, the call fails. 

A little weirded out by his tone, I look at my notifications and realize I had unwittingly sent out an ""I NEED HELP"" SOS text of my GPS location, a dark picture of my room, and a voice recording to my emergency contacts (a Galaxy feature apparently triggered by pressing the power button three times).  I quickly jump out of bed and grab the house phone while frantically trying to send out a group message to my mom, dad, and boyfriend that ""IT WAS A MISTAKE I'M SORRY I'M NOT DYING.""

Three phone calls to three panicked individuals later, all is well.  Except perhaps my mother's pants because she has IBS and probably shit herself.

Chuckling to myself a while later, I check over the messages and decide to listen to the audio recording, thinking hey, maybe I snore or something. Instead the only thing audible from the five second recording is a English male's voice.

""I want you to be as comfortable as possible both physically and mentally.""

TL;DR: Tried to get a seductive voice to lull me to sleep, nap-spasm sent out SOS to emergency contacts, made everyone think I was kidnapped by a creepy old English man. 

Update: HOLY CRAP THIS EXPLODED (/u/javaski hehe).  Since a lot of you requested it and the amount of references to /r/thatHappened made me angry (WHO LIES ON THE INTERNET GODDAMMIT), here's the audio recording.  I also included the two pictures sent along with a screenshot of my convo after with my mom.  She thought the kidnapper was being devious.

3ak57v,non_TBI,"This actually DID happen today. I was merrily browsing TIFU before work when I came across this little gem: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3ahtzb/tifu_by_not_wanting_to_show_a_girl_my_flaccid_dick/
Well, I learned what ""a grower not a shower"" is. Turns out it is not someone who gets taller but goes unrecognised, or, basically, people don't notice that he has gotten taller.  I've been calling my little brother (a 7 year old) one for years. Before you ask, I did get strange looks and embarrassed my parents on multiple occasions, but I never really understood why. 
I have said this in front of MANY people, including many of my relatives and my parents friends. NONE OF THEM TOLD ME WHAT IT MEANT.

TL;DR -Described my brother's penis to my friends and family"
42hwbt,non_TBI,"Quick background: I've had insomnia issues for years and went the prescription route about six months ago. Tried a thousand options, all unsuccessfully, and finally struck gold with Ambien. I take 10mg pretty much every night - total godsend. Recently started dating a new guy. He's great, I'm infatuated, and I'm doing everything in my power to not fuck it up.


As most of you probably know, the Ambien walrus is very real. If you don't go to bed within 20-30 minutes, you'll probably start seeing and doing weird shit. Most nights I'm asleep in minutes, but I've never had insane hallucinations or blacked out and done something ridiculous. I've watched pillows growl like lions, picture frames morph into dragons, and towels turn into the couple from American Gothic. The worst thing thus far was waking up to an order confirmation from Amazon prime for 24 boxes of sugar-free Jello.


Well, that is until 3:30 am today. Last night was our second adult sleepover. Around 3, he's sound asleep and starting to snore a little while I'm lying there under his cuddle trap, bug-eyed and wide awake. I'd had a long week and the idea of a sleepless night isn't too appealing, so I grab one from my purse, swallow the fucker, and crawl back into bed. We didn't have much to drink earlier and the Ambien walrus rarely hangs out with me, so I wasn't worried about anything.


About 15 minutes later, the BF wakes up and starts initiating sex, and I'm very down. He's hot, sex is fun, and let's just say 2015 was the most celibate year of my adult life. Everything's going great - a little making out, a little foreplay, the P goes in the V, everyone's happy. Important to note: we aren't doing anything remotely freaky. Very enjoyable, but very vanilla.


At this point, it's right around the 30 minute mark and just in time, the walrus pulls a Michael Jordan and comes out of retirement. The BF's been on top for a few minutes when I suddenly recoil a little. Out of nowhere I scream, ""Oh my god STOP. Can't we just have sex normally?!"" He pulls off and says, ""I'm sorry, of course...but what do you mean? Did I do something wrong?"" 


I was 100% convinced that we were having sex on stage at the Democratic National Convention while Hillary Clinton was delivering a speech. I thought his bed was next to the podium, and Hil was narrating our every move and explaining how real sex, aka not porn sex, works as part of some sex ed thing. He's howling laughing, can barely breathe, rolls off of me and tells me that sure, we can leave, we'll just go to sleep and have some normal sex later.


I wake up at 9-ish and as a huge fan of morning nookie, I'm all over him. Right as he's about to stick his dick in me, he smirks and goes, ""Oh I'm sorry, is this normal enough for you?"" I don't have a fucking clue what he's talking about. He starts cracking up and explains the entire thing, which I had ZERO recollection of (though it's been coming back to me today). I don't think I've ever been more embarrassed or turned a brighter shade of red in my life.


The bad news is, I don't think I can take Ambien again. Ever. I want to flush my remaining supply down the toilet and tell my doctor to cancel my refills and get me on something new. The good news is, this guy must be quite fond of me, because I'm pretty sure yelling that you don't want to fuck on stage at the Democratic National Convention would be a dealbreaker for most people. ^Don't^worry^we^still^boned^after


Oh, and I'm not even a Democrat. And I really don't like Hillary Clinton.


&nbsp;


TL;DR I yelled at my brand new boyfriend to stop fucking me because I thought we were on stage with Hillary Clinton.


*Edit:* Trazodone doesn't work, melatonin doesn't work, not actually going to flush my pills, and thank you for the gold!"
2xcik6,non_TBI,"My son is at that age where he spends a lot of time in the bathroom with the door locked. My daughter has made some remarks about it and I felt it was time that I addressed it. Here's how it went down:

I told my son to go have a shower before bed and as per usual he said he had to use the toilet first. He locked himself in the loo and was in there for 45 mins. In that time I had a shower (this is important later) and as he came out the bathroom I said 'Hey kids, I want to talk to you both. I just want to tell you that it's normal and natural to masturbate. It's nothing to be embarrassed about because you should be comfortable with yourself and your body. At this point my daughter burst out laughing and asked why I'm doing this now. I asked her what she meant and she said that her brother has been in the loo for 45 minutes so clearly I am talking about him.  My son was standing there blushing and I didn't want him to be embarrassed so I had to think of something quick and went with: Well you see, while I was in the shower, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and thought 'I would totally do me' and I just thought I would share that with you both because it's ok and totally normal. 

I walked away because we were all to embarrassed to be in the same room at that point."
34icdu,non_TBI,"This just happened. 
Well, my boyfriend and I are in college and both lead very busy lives. It's finals time which means we have hardly seen each other, which also means there's a lot of pent up sexual tension. Unfortunately, I have also had a really bad cold for the past few days, so our little time spend together has been diminished even more. 

Today was the first day that I was feeling 100%, so I decided it'd be great to meet him at the library for some late night kisses. He's still a little concerned about my disease ridden body, so he said he could walk me to my car and hug me goodnight before getting back to studying. He's an engineer student and taking very involved courses, so I knew he was really worried about his tests. However, I really wanted to get intimate, and I knew that this would be our one chance for another few days (we have finals up until next Wednesday.) I told him that he could hug me goodbye, or he could give me 10 minutes and I could make him cum. Now that would be a personal record of ours; he usually lasts a lot longer. He, being horny as well, agrees, and says that he'd love to see me try to get him off so quickly. 

We park in a parking garage next to the library and I give him the best blow job I've ever given, and he cums right at the 9 minute marker. Now remember, he hasn't had this sort of release in a while, so there's quite a bit of semen in my throat all of a sudden. Also, my one remaining symptom of the cold is a lingering buildup of mucus, which I keep having to cough out. We hug, talk all lovey dovey, pull his shorts back on, and I let him return to the library to his beloved books. As soon as I pull out of the garage, I feel a nice lump of mucus in my throat and know I have to spit. The only thing I have with me is a napkin from some fast food a few days ago, but desperate times call for desperate measures. I spit into the napkin, thinking only the little green lump would actually appear, but I was very wrong. Cum gushes out of my mouth and drops all over my black jacket and seatbelt. I look through my windshield and there's a group of freshmen girls staring at me. From their point of view, I'll be remembered as a sweaty girl drooling cum next to a soaked napkin in a library parking garage. 

TLDR: swallowed when I should've spit and spit when I should've swallowed. 

Edit: spelling
Edit 2: WOAH GOLD. I told my boyfriend and he sleepily laughed and then looked grossed out. :) thank you all for your wonderful comments, they've made my study breaks awesome. "
31ik4m,non_TBI,"We are staying with my mom for Easter. When I got up this morning everyone was still asleep, so I was on my own for breakfast. I rummaged through mom's fridge and found some left over meatloaf in a zip lock bag, some garlic mashed taters in a plastic tub and a metal bowl of peas. I dumped everything into the taters and mixed it up and nuked it. Then I dumped the concoction into the metal bowl and added some Sriracha. Not your typical breakfast, but I thought it was good. 
 
A while later my parents came downstairs. I was still sitting at the kitchen table reading the paper with the empty bowl next to me. My step dad picked up the bowl. ""Why is the dog's bowl on the table?""

""That's not the dog's bowl,"" I said. ""It was in the fridge, full of peas.""
 
My step dad said, ""Yeah, that is the dog's bowl."" Then mom explained that she gave their pit bull a hearty serving of left over beef stew last night, to make room in the fridge for the stuff she was making for Easter dinner. After he finished eating she noticed that he hadn't eaten the peas. ""There was just a layer of clean peas at the bottom of the bowl,"" mom explained, laughing. She'd found it amusing and put the bowl on the counter to show my step dad, but she'd forgotten about it and then my sister came through cleaning up the kitchen and put the bowl in the fridge.
 
So I might as well have french kissed a dog.

3dqqg9,non_TBI,"Tonight my girlfriend broke up with me while I was sitting in an internet cafe playing some games with some friends. I get a text from her and I’m pretty happy. It’s been long distance the past two months and she hasn’t been great at replying to messages. So I was chuffed until I read the message. Needless to say the news was not good and I bailed on my friends cause “i was suddenly feeling unwell”

By the time I hit the stairs to leave the cafe I can feel that I’m gonna start crying if I stop moving. Me? Cry in public? A 23 year old man who already struggles with the idea of being masculine. A man (boy lets be honest) Who kept growing a beard because one person one time said it made  him look a little older. Fuck that! I will uphold some sort of manliness during this disaster, potentially...hopefully.  Against all the odds I make it to the bus stop without crying. But the bus isn’t coming for ages. I'm pacing up and down checking and re checking my phone. Re reading the msg getting depressed all over again. The bus shows up and I’m on board in a second. But I don’t sit down I'm fucking stalking the aisle back and fourth. Keep moving. Keep fucking moving. I’m fucking daring the bus driver to tell me to sit down. 

He does so “Oi mate you can you sit down?”
You want me to sit down? YOU WANT ME TO FUCKING SIT DOWN?! I say in my head. In the real word I’m already sitting. I don’t want to piss off the bus driver. He didn’t break up with me. 
Keep moving. I’m jiving in my seat, legs fucking jack hammers pounding the floor. Trying to speed up the bus Fred Flintstone style. 

I know exactly what I’m gonna do when I get home. Change into shorts, chuck my running shoes on and sprint down to the harbour and scream out over the water. Oh yeah just like a fucking movie. Scream at the ocean, like the actor you tell yourself you will eventually be. (HAHAHAH why the fuck am I not proactive enough to audition for anything) Shut the fuck up self destructive nature! We telling a story! Back on track!

Bus is about to reach my stop but I’m up already. Everyone else on the bus looks pretty fucking happy I’m going. Oh  I’m sorry I wasn’t the ideal co passenger you snobs. I’m dealing with some shit so you’ll have to forgive me! Fly out the door in an instant and Im running up the hill to my house. Punch the back gate with my face. Fucking shit! ( gate just got replaced, way harder to open, opened it into my face) Brush it off! I’m fine (physically I’m fine, emotionally I’m a mess, duh) Back door code gets punched in at lighting speed. I’m up the stairs. Jeans off. Runners on. god dammit man put ya shorts on first then your runners. Runners off. shorts on. Runners on again. Nailed it. I’m down the stairs, grab a quick mouthful of water, reach the back door and it fucking hits me.
I need to shit. Like really need to shit. I pause at the door think about risking it. 
I do not risk it. 

As I’m running back up stairs to the bathroom I nearly shit myself on the 4th step. I was right not to risk it. 
Bathroom door flies open, I fly onto the seat and thankfully don’t shit on myself. But I’m not moving. I can’t move much at all. I’m stuck until the shitting ends and I know I won’t make it. I start crying. Like really fucking crying. I have never cried like this before. All the while this torrent of tears was coupled with what I can only describe as some of the most explosive shitting I have ever produced. Probably would have been one of the funniest things I’ve ever done and If  I wasn’t sobbing like the world was ending I probably would of laughed. But there I was for 10 minutes shitting an avalanche and crying a downpour. 

But as all things do, it ended (Much like my relationship! Oh snap! too soon? Of course it’s too soon you’re an emotional wreck. Only through laughter can I grow, HAHAHA, my heart is a black abyss...)

I wipe. Pants up. Tears dried. I rush back downstairs grab my earphones chuck on some heavy metal (so fucking hardcore) and start sprinting towards the ocean. It should be noted that this run to the ocean would be achievable by a fit person. I am not a fit person. Even a fit person would struggle to sprint the whole way and yet sprint I did until I felt like my lungs were gonna fucking kill me. Grief it seems does not increase your overall stamina. 

By the time I make it to the water I am almost more of a physical wreck than an emotional one. But I will persevere! I will scream my anguish out over the water like some crazy method actor. I drag myself up to the edge of the harbor and open my mouth to scream.

Only I don’t scream. I instead proceed to projectile vomit into the fucking harbor. It’s acidic, it burns, it kickstarts the tears again and it just keeps going! Are you fucking kidding me body? It was one tiny sprint. I vomit up the past months food. 

I’m shivering at this stage. Cause it’s winter. It’s 11:52pm and I’m in shorts next to the ocean. (Y em i so smart?) I drag myself to a bench and just sit there staring at the water until my throat stops burning. 

Then I just walk home. Stepped in dog shit on the way back, because you know, have to keep the misery as high as possible. And now I’m here sobbing silently onto my keyboard.

TLDR: Girlfriend broke up with me via text. Tried to dramatically deal with the sadness by planning to run to the ocean and scream out at the water. Ended up Sobbing and shitting at the same time on the toilet for ten minutes. Then tried to run to the ocean but I wasn’t fit enough and I projectile vomited into the ocean when I got there. Numerous other bad things also happened read above.

3gplwp,non_TBI,"This actually happened about an hour ago, so it really is *Today* I Fucked Up!

In life, there are many things which perhaps cross our minds, but which we decide not to explore, perhaps because of social pressure, or perhaps just because we don't go down that avenue. 
One of the things which I'd always been interested in was shaving my...nether regions.

Now, I appreciate it's not the weekend, and so I shan't go into any detail, but after 20 minutes of careful trimming and a sharp razor, I was smooth and comfortable. The sense of freedom was liberating, and it felt *amazing*. 

Where's the fuck-up? I hear you cry! 

Well, I woke up today, I started to feel a little uncomfortable, just a slight itchy scratchiness. (You know what it's like if you've gone to the barber, and you have hair stuck in your collar? it was kinda like that) but no matter, I thought, I'll just put some moisturiser on. When I've shaved my beard before, I'd used it to reduce razor-burn with great success. So, quickly, I squirted some stuff into my hands and \*ahem* applied it. The cooling feeling was great!

However, within about 5 seconds this cool freshness was replaced with a warming sensation, and then a *really* warm feeling, and the temperature kept rising, and rising, until it was **excruciatingly** painful. Like, ""Oh my god my balls are literally on fire and everything is burning!"" It was as if someone had thrown a Scotch Bonnet chilli into a volcano, mixed it with bleach and applied this paste to my sausage and eggs.
 
It was only at this point that I looked at what I'd squirted in my hand. I could see the bottle of moisturiser on my shelf, and next to it, a bottle of ""Deep Heat"" cramp relief. 
I'd been suffering from leg cramps after a run yesterday and had left it out, and in my haste didn't check which bottle I'd used.


I am still in pain.

**TL;DR:** I tried to make myself to look hot for my lady, ended up too hot and fried my eggs.


EDIT: A lot of you guys seem to doubt this happens, saying that it's an urban legend - but even more of you have messaged me expressing sympathy - it goes to show that really, a lot of us fuck up in the same ways!
Thank you to those of you who suggested remedies - I'm much cooler now, and I feel better!

Finally though, to whichever poor sod gilded me, thankyou! "
2sii2y,non_TBI,"So I should preface this by saying that I am a 17 year old male, and I recently went to the doctor for a physical. This practice is located in a converted house that's a little bit older and very small. They started off the process by having me produce a urine sample. They handed me a cup and pointed me to the bathroom. It wasn't until I had already filled the cup that I realized there was no lid. Weird, maybe, but I can't remember if they had given me a lid last time or not, so I ignored it. I walked over to the door and threw it open, forgetting how light the door was and how hard as quickly it opened. I managed to knock a young kid, maybe 4-6 years old, that was standing right in front of the door, onto his ass and before I could do anything about it, had already spilled my cup of urine all over his head and body. I was horrified, and the kid began to scream, along with his mother and several other people in the waiting room. She gave me a death glare, the doctors rushed out to see what had happened, and everybody turned to me. The rest of that physcial was very awkward, and now I likely need to find a new doctor. So, that was fun. "
27u6fz,non_TBI,"Today, my gf and I went to go get our nails done together (as good lesbians do). I was really excited for the massage chairs, and unbeknownst to be, they were a little more intense then the ones I am used to. When I sat down, the woman to the left of me commented on how the chair was massaging her ass and she seemed uncomfortable. I figured she was overreacting... That is until the woman who was going to give me a pedicure turned on my chair. 

The woman to my left was right, it was a butt massage, but as I was sitting straight up with my butt in the back of the chair, it hit a different spot. I squealed and my girlfriend gave me a look to shut up, and there were about 20 other women in the place so I didn't want to make a scene. I was like a deer in the headlights, frozen and unable to move, crippled with the anxiety of anyone finding out I was getting a hitachi magic wand straight to my clitoris. Needless to say, I came more than once and almost kicked the woman giving me a pedicure in the face. The chick to my left definitely knew, and gave me cut-eye as she walked out. 

TL;DR: Show me on the doll where the chair touched you."
41zve7,non_TBI,"This happened yesterday as most stories on this subreddit. 

So we had a bomb threat all over Massachusetts schools yesterday, we had to be exracted and everything. Police search dogs, bomb squad, FBI. The whole 9 yards. So me and my friend  were walking home when we were released from the school, and we got stopped by some reporter. My Boston accent shines through at the worse times, and the Italian in me makes me speak/think kind of fast. So when the reporter asked (on live TV) if anyone would do something like this, I responded ""No one in this school has the fucking balls to do it"" the reporter dropped his mic and the camera guy turned away. 

TIFU by swearing on live TV. "
3iqc6r,non_TBI,"FWB is currently asleep in my bed as I write this out. 

He was half asleep until I teased him to, er, full alertness. I proceeded to blow him, and when he came, he was really far down my throat. I'm not too sure what I did; it was like I breathed in and out at the same time in an effort to catch my breath. Well, my body and probably God said ""fuck you, slut,"" and next thing I know, his cum is spraying out my nose.

As it was pitch black in my room, FWB didn't notice anything amiss. I stayed quiet.

It still burns.

2mzqj2,non_TBI,"Ok so I live in Colorado and have separate gas and electric companies and typically this time of year your gas bill goes up and electric goes down. 
So money has been tight with the holiday's coming up we have had to forgo some things we have wanted like everyone does this time of year. I pay the bills every Friday. So today I go online to pay my gas bill, and keep in mind the last few months I have paid $90.00 then $117.00 then $247.00 last month which seems oddly high but it was minus 11 at one point so I chalk it up to that. 
Today I check it and its $597.98 and I lose it I'm WTFING all over the place, I call customer service and I am ready to fight. ""Listen my bill is to high I have no idea why it would be that much!"" 
So the lady on the other end calmly says ""Well sir back in august you over paid by about 58 dollars and a credit went onto your account see that CR on your account?""  ""Yes..."" I say slowing starting to realize what's going on. She says ""Well... you have been paying the credit balance the past 3 months and that 596 is a credit on your account not a past due would you like us to send you a check for the 596?."" I of course say Yes and needless to say I am an idiot but we wont be completely broke this Christmas. TIFU in a pretty decent way. "
2d6rkb,non_TBI,"I've been cutting my own hair since the eighth grade.  I like to keep it pretty short, so rather than spending $15 every month for what is essentially a buzz cut, I bought a pair of clippers and have been doing it myself ever since.  While this is wildly convenient (and has probably saved me a couple thousand dollars over the last 12+ years), it's generally a pain to clean up.  

To combat this, I've developed a system where I stand / kneel over the thick plastic hair-cutting bib that came with the clippers (the little cape they put on you at the salon), letting the hair fall and gather on that, and carefully emptying it into the trash when I'm done.

Which brings us to yesterday.  I had a ceremony to attend and wanted to look fresh – and due to a recent move, I didn't have access to my normal bib hair-catch system.  So I laid a towel on the ground to catch all the hair, fired up the clippers, and went about my business.

As I finished my haircut, I decided to trim my beard as well.  

*Gotta look nice and groomed for the night!  And, hey, my chest hair is looking a little out of control too, let's give that a trim.  And while I'm at it, let's just do the whole deal!*  

I grabbed my pube trimmer (I have a separate pube trimmer, I'm not an animal) and do a real nice, thorough manscape.  Shaft, balls, gooch, ass, inner thighs, back.  By the end I'm feeling 5 pounds lighter.  The mass of body hair that has accumulated on the towel resembles a slumbering poodle.

At this point I realize I'm a bit behind schedule, so I quickly fold the towel up, taking care not to leave any openings for the hair to spill out, put the hair-towel in the cupboard beneath the sink, and hop in the shower.

Fast forward to this morning, when I'm awoken by the ungodly shrieks of my girlfriend in the bathroom.  I jolt out of bed and open the door, revealing my lovely girlfriend, looking like the little monkey boy from Jumanji.  **She used the hair-towel.**  My nasty body hair clippings are clinging to her wet skin, from her forehead to her knees. My pubes affixed themselves to her quivering lips, my ass hair congregating on her tits.  She screams ""WHAT THE FUCK"" and all I can do is laugh.  She's spitting hairs out of her mouth and turns the water back on to try and rinse the hair off, but its those stubborn, coarse hairs that only seem to stay put in the shower.  She has to be at work in 30 minutes and still looks like Hermione after the polyjuice potion.

TL;DR: I'll never forget the look of horror, disgust, and desperation on her cute little gorilla face."
3ahtzb,non_TBI,"I posted this in another sub two days ago but i figured that i could post it here as well. 

I was dating this girl when we decided it would be nice and fun to do a bath-date together... Sooo, this night we set up our plan to bath together at her place because i don't have a bathtub.

We already had sex some weeks prior but i didn't want her to see my flaccid dick. Yes, I'm a grower not a shower. And for some stupid reason i just didn't want her to know how my not erect dick looked.

While the water was cooling down and we were waiting for it to reach a comfy temperature she went downstairs to get some wine. This was my chance to strip naked, get in the tub as fast as i could and hide my dick under the shampoo bubbles we just put in.

I didn't feel the water first, there was no time for that so i jumped in there like an olympic swimmer. The water didn't cool down at all... it was still fucking hot. I mean this water was practically boiling. Sauron could've forged that ring in there.

The heat almost got me fainted, I started screaming like a lobster which got my date run up the stairs to see what was happening. There i was, completely naked, with my ass hovering above the water with my flaccid dick peaking through the bubbles.

tl;dr - just show her your flaccid dick or you might burn it

edit - I never could have thought that so many people would be talking about my dick today. Thanks for all the do's and don'ts, will come in handy the next time!"
3lb11d,non_TBI,"Like almost all TIFUs this did not happen today, but some time ago. For obvious reasons I am using a throw away and being vague about some details because anyone who reads this and is a chemist at the university I attended will know who I am. For some background, I was a graduate student at a large R1 university getting a Ph.D. in chemistry. As an organic chemist, I frequently use compounds that require delicate handling and an exquisite extravagance of attention. I was working in a lab that frequently used fairly reactive things (in that they reacted spontaneously and spectacularly with air or water)^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmkBH-ncG1Y). The problem with that is when you use dangerous things every day, you get used to them, and the danger goes away. You become complacent. Maybe you make assumptions about the what safety protocols others are following. This is a horrible practice. 



One of the things I frequently used to clean certain types of glassware was concentrated nitric acid. You really need to be careful with nitric acid, not only is it a very strong acid, but also insanely good at nitrating things in addition to being a superb oxidizing agent. This means that not only is it super corrosive and can eat through copper and other metals pretty quickly, but that it also reacts violently and often explosively with most organic chemicals to produce toxic gas + a nitrated compound.^[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBVdGGml6bU) Nitrated compounds make great explosives. As Wikipedia says, “Nitration of organic compounds with nitric acid is the primary method of synthesis of many common explosives, such as nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene (TNT). As very many less stable byproducts are possible, these reactions must be carefully thermally controlled, and the byproducts removed to isolate the desired product.”^[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid)



I’m sure you can see where this is going…



So here is where the chain of events that was my fuckup begins. I was cleaning some glassware with nitric acid, which is a fairly common method to get very clean glass.^[4](http://curlyarrow.blogspot.com/2008/01/how-to-clean-your-sintered-funnel.html),[5](http://www.starna.com/ukhome/d_tech/tech01.html) The waste bottle that we use to dispose of nitric acid was full, so I had to procure a new empty bottle to use as the nitric acid waste. Typically we use an empty bottle of nitric acid as the waste container for used nitric acid. This way, the nitric acid is going into a container that only ever held nitric acid (IE no random organic chemicals left around in the bottle to react with the acid). There were no empty nitric bottle in lab so rather than go get a new one 4 floors down, I grabbed a common use waste bottle. These are 4 liter glass bottles with a screw on cap.^[6](https://static.fishersci.com/images/F203653~wl.jpg) Usually they are used to collect organic waste, brought to a central facility where they are emptied and then thoroughly cleaned. University protocol is that they are first cleaned with ethanol, then water. The idea is that the only remnants in these bottles should be water. I happened to pick a bottle that had not been washed with water. Knowing that nitric acid was dangerous, I visually checked the bottle to make sure it was empty. There was a little bit of water (or so I thought)^7 in the bottom, which did not concern me because nitric acid and water are fine to mix.^8 I proceeded to clean my glass using a total of 30-50 mL of nitric acid, which I disposed of in the waste container. Knowing that nitric acid could react with organics, I left the waste bottle un-capped in my fumehood for about 60 seconds after I put the nitric in. Seeing no reaction, I then capped the waste bottle loosely. This probably saved me a trip to the hospital.

 Now, the astute chemist reading this may have figured out what happened next.^[9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFwiZYfEsuY) Nitric acid and ethanol (remember this bottle was supposed to be washed with water, but never was) react very violently to produce heat and a large amount of gas. This reaction has an incubation time of a few minutes before it really kicks in. So 20 or so seconds after capping this bottle, I hear an ominous whistling sound. The kind of whistling you would rather not hear in a chemistry lab. I look at my fume hood and saw a very large and copious amount of brown gas (NOx) billowing out from my loosely fitted cap. As the whistling increased to a truly terrifying pitch, I had a few seconds to dive behind a wall before the waste bottle exploded with a force much larger than that mortar from the front page yesterday.^[10](http://i.imgur.com/sHhftlF.gifv),[11](http://publicsafety.tufts.edu/ehs/files/March2015.VII-LabAccidentsExplosionsInvolvingNitricAcid.pdf),[12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulNeRQxORTM) Here I fucked up again as despite my 10 or so second lead time, I did not warn anyone that a glass shrapnel bomb was about to go off. I am so fucking lucky that no one decided to come around the corner at that moment. As the nitric acid tinged glass rained down upon me, my lab mates rushed to see what was wrong. I yelled for them to evacuate the lab as a billowing cloud of brownish green gas (a toxic mix of nitric acid, nitrous oxide, ethyl nitrate and the various other chemicals in my hood which were vaporized and atomized) was spewing forth from my fumehood. Alarms were going off, lights in the ceiling were blown out and haphazardly hanging from their sockets, I'm pretty sure an undergraduate was crying... Needless to say, we exited the lab in admirable time. A few minutes later, the chief safety officer arrived with gasmasks in tow. Our lab replaces the air about every 2 minutes due to the fumehoods and by design for instances just like this, so after 5 minutes, we deemed it safe enough to reenter with gasmasks on. The level of destruction was actually surprising.^[11](http://publicsafety.tufts.edu/ehs/files/March2015.VII-LabAccidentsExplosionsInvolvingNitricAcid.pdf) Everything in my hood was destroyed. The window directly behind my fumehood was destroyed. That window was made out of ¼ inch thick safety glass. This explosion sent a shard or shards of glass flying hard enough to bust a hole clean through 1/4 inch thick safety glass... Had I been standing in front of this thing, or had anyone else, they would have been in the hospital with some very serious injuries. In doing some research, I found out this is not a fairly uncommon laboratory accident and a simple google search of Nitric acid + ethanol furnishes a number of safety reports on similar incidents.

An investigation found out that two parties were at fault. The waste bottle should have never had ethanol left over in it. Improper handeling on EH&S was determined to be the major cause. Me being a fucktard was determined to also be a cause. Because of this, a number of safety protocol with how waste bottles are handled were changed, and incoming graduate students get to hear about what I did. Gratifyingly I did not get in trouble because everyone handled themselves like adults. 

TLDR: I might be the only person to use the excuse “I blew up my lab today” for why I was late to my first date ~~with my future fiancé~~ and have it be a real excuse. *Luckily she realized I was a keeper, is now my fiance and we have a great first date story.

3bk7lo,non_TBI,"I never thought it would happen to me reddit, but today I fucked up by calling my interviewer gay. 

I've been interviewing for a new position at work over the past several weeks. I have been really stressed, but I had just finished the last interview and decided to unwind by playing ping-pong in the break room with one of my colleagues. 

This is were my fuck up occurred. With my brain near mush and what little concentration I had left focused on the game I made what has to be one of the most cringe-worthy statements of my entire life. 

Enter one of my previous interviewers. He had interviewed me several weeks prior and was clearly gay. Super nice guy, just one of the nicest guys you've ever met and clearly homosexual. 

In any event, he walks into the break room, looks right at me with a big smile and says ""YAY /u/cawdrizzle, did you hear the good news?!"" and in my delirium I found myself replying ""Yeah, the Supreme Court really came through this weekend!""

I have never seen a smile turn into a scowl as quickly as that moment but I tell you if I was timing it, it may have been a world record. My interviewer then coldly says, ""You got the job"" and walked out of the room. 

So now I'm trying to find out where I can dig a bunker to go live in for the rest of my life. 

Thanks for reading :(


**UPDATE:** Well it's rather anti-climactic but some of you are asking for an update. I passed him in the hall this morning and we exchanged pleasantries like normal. I chose to forgo the apology and just accept that I have the social skills of a newt. I didn't want to unintentionally offend further. However I had previously wrote him a nice letter for being so awesome and checking up constantly on my interview process, so I guess I will be be giving that to him a little sooner than expected. Thanks for the feedback everybody!"
2sx1yp,non_TBI,"I work for a very large store chain, and have been there for a year and 8 months. I was doing my taxes because I'm saving up for a down payment for a new car, and I'm single, and live with my mother. I did my federal taxes online, and they amounted to $1200 (I owe the state $300). That shouldn't have happened. I check my paycheck, to make sure I filed under ""single and no children."" Apparently, I had 9 exemptions on my paycheck...That is, EVERY. SINGLE. PAYCHECK. SINCE.

2bclz6,non_TBI,"This was a little while ago, but whatever. So I've been dating this girl for a few months now and we're just chilling at my place like we usually do. I load up the ol' computer to put on a film for us and, as per usual while booting, steam loads up. So she looks at my library and decides she hasn't played the Sims for ages, so instead of a film I'm going to watch her chill out to some Sim action. 

First alarm bell rang when she looked at the amount of time I've spent on that game. 143 hours in total. Mostly this time is due to me leaving it on while I do other shit, but really that's just way too long to be playing the Sims. She laughs at me for being a sad douche, continue on to playing. 

Second alarm bell when she loads up my only sim, Freddie Faggotson. That's when I remembered everything I had been doing with that one sim for 143 hours. I had fucked every single person in the sim village to create as many children as possible, a total of around sixty children? The only reason I didn't have more was because there were literally no women left in the village that weren't either my daughter or elderly. Not only that, but I had figured out I could take dna samples from sims and clone them, but they end up as babies and I have to raise them from birth. So I was basically factory farming as many dna cloned children as I could so I could fuck them later to get more children in the most horrible controlled death camp kind of style. As soon as they were old enough to take care of their own needs they would never leave their cells. All of this she saw as she was exploring, and my house wasn't the only sex dungeon farming expansion I had, I owned several properties in the town that were chock full of these children I was going to fuck and create more children with.

tl;dr I created a horrible sim rape dungeon, forgot about it and my girlfriend saw it.

UPDATE: So a few people wanted to know her reaction, it was a mix of belly laughter and creeped outness. She played the save for a while and even made a few sims pregnant for the hell of it but then she made me delete the save, so no screenies. The reason it's a fuck up was that during sex she would sometimes go ""Oh mr faggotson!"" Or she'd offer me some of her hair jokingly so I could clone her.  Any kind of problem we had could just be countered with ""yeah at least I don't have a digital rape dungeon""

37u4ik,non_TBI,"This was actually a couple of days ago but I didn't really prioritise posting this story on reddit at the time.

My flatmates and I went to Amsterdam to celebrate the end of our first year at uni. Amongst other such cultural activities that one would partake in when visiting Amsterdam (such as the Van Gogh museum), we also decided to go to the zoo. 

We spent a lovely day gawking at all the animals and spending our valuable recreation budget on overpriced food in the café. Cut to the end of the zoo visit, and the fateful event. My friend, T, has a big thing for lions and insisted we go and see the smug fuckers before the day ended.

And so it was that we traipsed on tired feet to the lion enclosure to look at the lions. They seemed kinda lazy, just moping around and not really doing much so a few of us went and sat on a bench. It was then that the lion began roaring, not full on roaring but just little ones, like he was building up to something big. 

I only remember this bit in slow motion with ominous music in the background. Intrigued, I made my way towards the enclosure alongside a bunch of other gormless tourists. The lion surveyed the faces before it.

He opened his mouth, displaying his magnificent maw.

We waited with bated breath.

He turned, facing away from the cage.

We stood, a group of us, waiting for the mighty roar.

He reared his head and...

Literally fucking projectile pissed right in my eye. At the time everyone was in chaos, screaming and running from the dreaded stream but fear was replaced with laughter when they heard me scream ""HE FUCKING PISSED ON ME!""

Safe to say, I went straight back to my hotel and had the longest shower of my life. But I can never wash away the hilarious, embarrassing leverage my friends now have over me.

P.S. To all the random tourists who stood there pointing and laughing. Fuck you, it could have just have easily been you!

TL;DR

Lion peepee in my peeper

EDIT: For some bizarre reason, some people think I made this whole story up due to the lion enclosure in Artis being separated by a sizable body of water. However, I explained that there is a separate part of the enclosure that requires them to go through the indoor part. This allows you to get closer to the lions. Hopefully, this photographic proof that you can in fact get close to the lions will be enough to put any cynic's mind to rest.

Obligatory this happened last year. My brothers and I decided to get a tattoo in memory of our late grandfather. He was a great man and an even better businessman. His most memorable venture was his bow tie company, so we all picked one bowtie out of his private collection to get done. I had work the morning of the tattooing, so both of my brothers went first. (This is where I fucked up) work was busy that day and I hadn't gotten to eat anything. In order to calm my jitters I thought it would be a good idea to smoke a little joint on the way over. Everything started alright until I felt a little woossy, the tattoo artist went to fetch me some candy and when he returned I had passed out and fallen on the floor face first. Well that wasn't the worst of it. After recuperating, I walked outside for some fresh air and noticed that there was something extra in my pants, yup you guest it I shit my pants after I passed out. Frantically rush to the bathroom and rip my underwear off throw them away and used up everything they had to clean myself.... it took me a hole year to come back and finish the tattoo and I even included a little number 2 to show that it took twice to get my first ever tattoo

TL;DR, don't smoke weed before getting a tattoo for the first time. Also make sure you eat something or you will pass out and shit your pants."

It was 11.9.15, so, for ""a bit of banter"" I decided to go into school pretending to be all depressed. A group of my mates, asked me if I was alright, I said ""no"". They then proceeded to ask what was the matter. I told them that my uncle died 14 years today. They were all pretty shocked. One said ""are you alright"". I told them not to worry becuase he took 2000 other people down with him.

That is how I got suspended for a week. I'm a dick.

Tldr: Don't be racist to yourself and make jokes about 911.

EDIT: Wow I'm glad everyone liked my fuck up. Last night I had 10 upvotes on this post, I woke up and I have 2000. Before this I had 50 comment karma xD

EDIT2: Just checked my inbox, rip

EDIT3: Just came back from school, 3000 up votes and been given gold for taking this piss out of the colour of my skin, thanks btw and wow.

EDIT4: Wow, top of r/tifu yesterday xD Let me just get something straight, I never said I didn't deserve the consequences for my actions, instead I've said how much of a dick I am and how I fucked up big."
2hqybr,non_TBI,"In an effort to be sexy and save money I decided to wax my own vagina. I researched it online and watched videos and I've had them done professionally since I was 15. I figured if my Puerto Rican high school dropout bikini waxer can do it, then so can I. I took a Xanax and applied the wax and ripped. Easy peasy! It didn't hurt and the hair was actually coming out. As I was applying wax to the innermost sensitive area of the vagina my husband came in the room. I was half kneeling half planking over my makeup mirror in a sports bra and nothing else while applying the wax with a tongue depresser. When he came in I screamed ""DONT LOOK AT ME!!!!!"" And tried to do a barrel roll behind my makeup vanity so he couldn't see me. As I did this the tongue depresser lodged itself in between my downtown lips and the wax stuck to both sides of the tongue depresser, which was now lodged firmly into place. If you don't know anything about bikini wax it dries very quickly. I tried to open my legs but the tongue depresser was stuck to both lips and there was nothing I could do. So I figured my best bet was to breathe deeply and rip it as fast as I could. I am currently writing this in the lobby of Urgent Care while wearing an adult diaper because I ripped a two inch section of flesh off of my vagina and am bleeding rather profusely. So please, men and ladies, if you're going to get waxed find your nearest Puerto Rican high school dropout and let them rip your hair off for you. 


Edit: guys and girls thanks so much for the gold. It means a lot to me. I've now been gilded for a) appearing in a Glory Hole while resembling Deb from Dexter and b) for maiming my vagina. I love you all, I'm going to go home and sit gently on a bag of ice. I'll be back tomorrow to answer your questions and apologize to the people of Puerto Rico.

Second edit: So sorry for offending anyone from Puerto Rico, I was just stating the fact that my waxer has told me multiple times that she is a Puerto Rican high school drop out. Also, I live in Miami, it's very common to get bikini waxes starting in high school. I would not get a Brazilian wax (please don't get offended that I wrote Brazilian), just a simple bikini line wax where you leave your panties on, so I wasn't spread eagle in front of a random stranger. And as stated previously, I went to a reputable salon, not some van with tinted windows and a sign that said ""free waxes for young teen girls!"" To answer the question ""why did you freak out if your husband saw you?"" If you've never seen someone wax themselves it looks like a gorilla crime scene. There are sticky strips covered with hair and tiny specks of blood on the towel you sit upon while sweating and yanking large patches of fur off your choocha. It's just not cute. It has nothing to do with my husband, I just want to feel sexy and that's not a sexy time for anyone to see. It's uncomfortable, awkward and tear filled. I mean I guess that turns a lot of people on, but I prefer to surprise my husband with a nice, trimmed clam friend to eat rather than let him see the de-bearding process. 


Third edit: if you guys liked this I have some more horrifying stories that I can share with you. None of which involve any ethnicities or races!"
2pl8x9,non_TBI,"Ok so today was a pretty normal day. I woke up at 7Am cleaned myself up, collected a kiss from my mum and went to school. Mum was ready for work too. School was fun, beside the never-changing fact, that this fat kid next to me in class just wont FREAKING stop eating and tear my nerves. So schools out, me going to the school bus, the buslady Telling me that i should wait here because my dad later picks me up for what ever reason she didnt know. So i waited. Finally he arrived, tells me to get in and just shut the fuck up. I was shocked didnt know what to say but did what he said. So he obviously was pretty pissed staring at the road didnt say anything at all. I said: dad.. he said:could you  JUST be quiet please...i said: ok...So we arrived at home and then i couldnt believe what i saw. I just  remembered that candlelight i forgot to kill, before going to school. My parents knew i always let the candlelight in my room on. And they knew.. 

The House was half Burned down with the firemen killing the Rest of the fire.

So how was your day?

Sidenote : Actually  the same thing happened to a friend of mine a couple of years ago, two of his turtles and one or so cats caught fire and eventually died. But it wasnt his fault. It was his legless, depressed mum who I think let a cigarette on, and dropped in the kitchen and my friend picked her up, and then the flathome burned down or so.. im not sure though.
"
3e219m,non_TBI,"This morning like every morning I got out of bed stumbled down to my bathroom and undressed in preparation for a shower.   

Now, I have one of those enclosed cubicle showers and when I opened the door I noticed a small moth in the corner of the shower.  
""Fuck,"" I thought to myself. ""Here's another bloody thing I have to deal with, I don't want a fucking moth flying all around the place while I'm trying to shower.""  

So I turned on the shower a little bit to encourage my little friend to vacate the premises, of course it starts freaking out and flying all over the place just as I knew it would. However it finally finds the open door, comes racing out, hooks around and crashes smack-bang into my crotch, where it became entangled in my pubic hair. Now, being a single male who never had much luck with the ladies, I've had no incentive to maintain it, so it was tangled up there well and good.  

Having a live moth in your pubic hair is not a fun experience so letting out a slew of expletives I attempted to remove the moth with a gentle flick... which caused the moth to explode.

It was awful. It was like a scene from predator; desecrated corpses in a jungle.

Needless to say there was much shampoo and soap used that day.

**TL;DR A moth kamikaze'd into my pubic hair and when I tried to remove it it exploded into little moth pieces**"
3fc96b,non_TBI,"Long time lurker on the is sub (although just changed account). 
I am writing this to say that I am fed up with the overly sexualised ""fuck ups"" which have unnecessary detail which IMO is just there to generate up votes, and leaves other more interesting fuck ups off the front. 
I know that stuff like this has been posted before and I know that of course some detail is needed but shit like this:
 
>""I just got in this mood to give him exclusive ball action with my tongue and hands. I first started by just licking, slurrped up and, placed each ball inside my mouth and went to town by sucking and licking them. I then laid beside him showing how much I loved him by sucking and licking his neck... my fingertips tracing the outlines of his skin, I began to just rub his balls in such a fluid motion. He pulled me on top of him, I turned around so he could get a eyeful of my ass I leaned in bypassing his hard cock and began licking his nuts again.""

Just sounds like 50 shades of grey.
I don't think that this adds to the story and (mostly?) Isn't needed.

Sorry for the rant, obviously other people don't feel this way but I think that this sub has lost it's roots."
34l0zp,non_TBI,"Okay, so this didn't happen today exactly but a relative of mine mentioned it to me and refreshed my memory and now I am burning in shame.


So, when I was around 8 years old I had this obsession with superpowers, superheroes, the works, and really wanted any power regardless of how lame it was, be it the power of super strength, super hearing, growth, etc. 


One day, when I was watching TV, this really hot steamy sex scene suddenly popped up and for the first time I saw a woman's nipples. Instinctively, I started to touch my crotch for some reason because it felt weird... I then noticed that I had a raging bulge in my pants. I was amazed. I grew?


At that point, I convinced myself that I had a superpower and was eager to show the world. The next day was my birthday and in front of all my friends and relatives I proudly announced that I was a superhero and told them that I had the power of growth. One of my friends didn't believe me so I showed them a demonstration. Right then and there, I grabbed my crotch area and started rubbing it - hard - in front of all those little kids who's parents were rushing to cover their eyes. In about 30 seconds I managed to ""get it up"" and gave a proud smirk of achievement to my audience. 


God, I fucked up.

3crtxg,non_TBI,"My brother, 13, goes to a day camp at a local community college in my hometown. I was visiting home for a few days (working at my college over the summer), and my parents were encouraging us to spend time together since I wouldn't see him for long.

I picked him up from his day camp, which ended at 4, and had to entertain him until his drum lessons at 5. Knowing that he's obsessed with video games, I took him to a GameStop near his drum lessons. 

Everything went according to plan until it was time to leave. 4:50 hit, we needed to go, but he wasn't having any of it. 4:54, he still really *really* didn't want to leave, and by this point I was growing impatient because I didn't want my parents to be pissed at me for making him late. 4:57 and I grab his hand and tell him the **we need to leave**.

""Danny, we have to go.""  
""Just one more minute!""  
""No, dude, your lessons are starting like ***now***. Let's go.""  
 ""Just give me a sec! I just need like two secs.""  

I, an 18 year old boy, grabbing my 13 year old brother's hand in a crowded GameStop, angrily yelled

###***""DANNY, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SECS.""***

I got a lot of concerned looks, got really red in the face, and got the hell out of there as quickly as fucking possible. "
3575nj,non_TBI,"(I posted this on /r/funny, but it was recommended that I try it out on here. My apologies if you read it already)


At our school, we are required to do two ""duties"" outside of our normal classes. One of mine turned out to be lunch duty with two other teachers, for the entire middle school.


So today while walking around the cafeteria and watching the students, I found two nickels on the ground. I sneakily picked them up and put them in my pocket, and continued walking. I was sure nobody saw me, so I thought nothing more of it.


About fifteen minutes later, I found another nickel. I again looked around, and put it in my pocket. It was about five minutes later that I found two more spread across the floor between two tables. I couldn't believe how many nickles I was finding.


For the next 10 minutes, I continued finding about a total of 8 nickles. Before the bell rang, I reached in my pocket to feel the pocket full of treasure I had found. It was gone! I had been robbed!


I looked over at a table of adolescent boys, and saw them giggling at me. When I asked them what was so funny, they said, ""reach a little deeper!"". After taking the young one's advice, I quickly realized that there was a hole the size of my fist in my left pocket. When I asked the boy laughing the hardest how he knew, he said that their table watched me the entire period, picking up change, taking a few steps, and watching the silver flow out of my pant leg.


I immediately turned red, but found the humor in the situation. Putting myself in their situation, I could only imagine how funny and ridiculous a teacher looked in this scenario.
Disclaimer: The reason I looked like a moron to the entire 7th and 8th grade is because that table of boys told just about everyone in the room. I had a girl in the hall say to me, ""Mr. W, can I borrow a nickle?"" This was followed by a roar of laughter."
3z0amn,non_TBI,"Last night I started my NYE celebrations at a mates house. We were drinking beers and I had downed about 5 in an hour and a half. So I was a little drunk walking down to the carnival. Now my body build is very lean and skinny. I am considered a bit of a light weight. I had packed 6 beers for myself and a liter of Jack Daniels straight. When walking down to the carnival and where there was live music. Once I walked down there, I started drinking the Jack straight from the bottle. Which was like rocket fuel compared to the beer I was drinking. After 2 hours I drank half of my Jack and I couldn't stand up and I was vomiting everywhere. Someone called the Police so I was taken back to the cells where I was spewing and passed out. I had no charges laid against me. Once my parents picked me up. I was as white as a sheet of paper and I was frothing at the mouth. My Grandpa who was with my parents said I needed to go to hospital. Where I got my stomach pumped and had to be assisted breathing for 2 hours. My blood pressure was 84/45 and my heart was beating at double what it should be. I was so close to total organ failure. 
I woke up this morning in my own bed wondering where I was and my friend who was staying over was relieved I woke up. Now I am being asked all these questions and lectures about responsible drinking while dealing with the biggest hangover of my life. Last night I fucked up.

Edit: thank you all for the hangover advice and to clarify I am 18 and living in Australia. Happy new year to all as well everyone stay safe over this festive season"
2u2gsw,non_TBI,"So my sister and I resolved to get fit together this year and have started going for afternoon jogs around our neighborhood.

We are two years apart and best friends so we do really dumb shit in front of eachother all the time just out of sheer boredom or to make eachother laugh.

We were almost home and I had been holding in gas for ages. I was jogging slightly in front of my sister and so decided to let out my gas in a series of short, loud farts while exclaiming that I was 'jet powered'. My sister told me I was gross and from behind her I heard a muffled laugh. An older lady and an incredibly hot guy our age had been walking about 10 feet behind us. My sister began laughing hysterically and I quicky fled to our front yard and around the side gate to escape. 
Turns out the lady is our new next door neighbor and the hot dude is her son. Fuck."
45r9du,non_TBI,"Ok, so this just happened about a half hour ago. My wife and I are in the process of potty training our daughter and we have a tiny Minnie Mouse toilet that has a bucket like apparatus that sits under the seat for catching all ""boop boops."" I work late hours and last night after getting home I had me a couple adult beverages before heading to bed. Fast forward a few hours later I'm woken up from my daughter screaming in her bed, which usually means get me now or I'm going potty all over my bed. So I go in and grab her and take her to do her business. I didn't turn the light on in the hopes I could put her back to bed for a bit longer. I set her on her seat and she starts to go. Hearing your little spawn let their bladder go is one of the best sounds ever. You know that you don't have to clean a big mess and that the tons of money for diapers are gone. I'm sure anyone who potty trained their little one knows what I mean.
     Anywho while she's going my happiness turns to confusion as my foot is getting wet. When she is done we go through our high fives and I send her to get in bed with mommy. I turn the light on and instantly realize that her mom had not put the bucket thingy back into the potty after cleaning it, so she had actually peed through the potty not in the potty. Not only that, she was now chilling in our bed with her mom asking why is her feet wet?


I just wanted everyone to know that we have acquired a new seat so she can actually use the big person potty. My only worry now is that we don't forget it's not in there at some point and have her fall in. "

One of the brave and few, this actually happened today. 

I was talking in the hallway with one of my friends who is a girl and today is pajama day at our school. Peoe were walking by and we were just talking

Im fairly comfortable with most of my friends that are girls so i wanted to see what shirt she was wearing

So i do what any teenage male that doesn't think before he acts. 

I unzipped her hoodie in the middle of a hallway where many people were traveling through. She wasnt wearing a shirt 

So after showing everyone in the hallway my friends melons Lots of nervous laughter and red faces. Being yelled at and laughed at im sitting across the table from her in study hall and the first thing she says to me after a couple hours

""I told your mother""

2bmluw,non_TBI,"This happened two days ago so I thought I'd share it, but a little bit of back story. Me and my best friend (we'll call her Cara) have known each other since we were 13 (we're both 22 now). I don't have any interest in her besides being friends. I've seen her through good relationships and bad break-ups and vice-versa. Her current boyfriend (we'll call him David) who she's been dating for a year is a pretty cool guy, we all hang out, drink beer, shoot pool, etc. I try to avoid being the third wheel but they insist on having me around, but I think that's gonna change now.

Story: Every other day we hang out over Cara's, play some Minecraft  and CoD, and I head out for work. I usually leave at 5:30pm to be there at six, but I had taken that day off. Working 13 hour shifts is a bitch. Around 5:00pm I decided to go get some air, so I went out on the deck and sat by the pool, and I ended up drifting off to sleep.  

When I woke up it was 6:15pm and I wondering why they weren't out here with me. Then I remembered, I didn't tell them I took the day off, they probably thought I left for work and didn't bother. I'm thinking we can all go get pizza since I'm still here. As I head back inside with my craving for pizza, I walk straight through the kitchen and into the living room, and what do my eyes see? Cara, ass naked on the floor, riding David (who is handcuffed to the table btw) like a demon. At one point I thought she was going to break his pelvis (death by Snu-Snu!) She had a black dildo wielded in the air like she was about to charge into battle with it, and it was then I noticed David had red dick imprints on his face and chest. They both had 9 inch grins on they're faces until they turned and saw me and turned completely red. They were speechless with those ""oh shit"" facial expressions. Straight ahead on the tv, they still had Minecraft loaded up, the annoying music had stopped and all the damn farm animals were staring at me like they were waiting for my reaction. Even the damn chicken (or duck?) stopped to stare at me and that little bastard is always causing shenanigans! I told them ""nah you guys finish up I'm gonna go home now"" and left. The drive home consisted of me laughing like an idiot with tears in my eyes. Well two hours ago she sent me a text message saying ""yeah, we need to talk about the other day"". Idk know what's going to happen from here on out, hope it doesn't ruin our friendship. 

tl;dr: Went outside for some air at best friends house, went to sleep, woke up, went back inside, caught a front row of her and her boyfriend having freaky rough sex. Minecraft animals were staring at me like a sandwich. I never got my pizza.

Update 7/24: Okay first off, Jeezus Reddit! I didn't think it'd be this popular! Second, I'm at work on my break, and yes an update is coming. Me her and David are meeting up for breakfast when I get off work so I'll update when we're done, and thank god they know nothing of Reddit. I'll keep you guys posted! Also I really want to get to the comments, you guys are awesome as hell.

Update 7/25: Well we met up for breakfast when I got off work, and I'm not going to lie I was pretty worried. I wasn't traumatized by the grand event I witnessed, in fact I thought it was hilarious. I was more-so worried about how they felt about the whole thing. I've caught them both in some pretty funny situations (and vice-versa) but nothing like that. At first there was some awkward silence, but then I told them about the Minecraft animals (especially that god damn chicken-duck) to break the ice, and they lost it. I also learned that after poor David was handcuffed Cara pulled the Dildo out and started slapping him, and that if I didn't show up when I did Cara would have hit him again. I completely lost my shit, and a mouthful of Pepsi. I told him be thankful that's all she did with it. I apologized to both of them like hell and told them both how awesome they are as friends to be able to laugh something like this off. I found out after breakfast that Cara had told David something about me that evened the score...fuck. It appears we have ourselves a Mexican standoff in that department (my days are numbered). Anyway, we're going to hang out again later on today, and I'm gonna make damn sure we get that bacon and ham pizza. 

Btw, Cara and David are NOT their real names, actually it's pretty far off. I am a guy, not a girl. Whoever gave this post gold, THANK YOU! Thank you guys, you're all funny as hell.

3i6kdm,non_TBI,"I would use a throwaway for this, but I have no shame.

Recently my girlfriend and I have been talking about grooming. She said she wanted to try and shave herself bare 'down there' and I asked if she would like me to do something about my peen afro, dreading the response. She said I should probably trim to about half size for practicality's sake, and of course I agreed.

I should mention at this point that not once in my life thus far had I taken a blade to that most holy of places, and had allowed my fuzz to grow wild and free as Mother Nature intended. Clean as a whistle and soft as down, my carpet was my pride and joy.

So this morning (UK time) I sat buck naked over the toilet like [Butters](http://i.imgur.com/GBTfE.jpg), a pair of ""safety"" scissors in front of me and Sherwood forest sprawling out over the bowl. My hand trembled as I reached for the scissors, my mind flashing back to every time the barber told me to stay still else he might accidentally cut my ear off. Ever so slowly, I opened the blades and snipped off the first chunk of long and curlies. 

*""There, that wasn't so bad now, was it?""* 

Confident now, I cut away more and more, hacking through my gentleman jungle with some pace. Admiring my handiwork, I started to get more ambitious, cutting closer and closer to my soft, pale skin. A glorious mound of hair grew in the toilet bowl. And then it happened. I saw it a moment too late. As the blades snapped shut, a tiny piece of nutsack flesh was sliced clean off with the pubes. 

My eyes watered from the stinging wound and the shock, and blood welled to the quarter inch wound. I flung the scissors down and grabbed a handful of toilet paper as a rivulet of blood ran down my balls. Clutching the paper to my bleeding bollocks I slid on my dressing gown and half ran, half waddled downstairs, doing my best to look normal as I walked passed our security camera. Heading to the kitchen cupboard, I snatched out the First Aid box and rifled through it for a plaster. All we had remaining was a kiddy dinosaur plaster. Fuck it, it would have to do.

The damn thing wouldn't stick, the remaining hair and ball sack wrinkles wouldn't allow the plaster to maintain contact. Panicking, I threw the plaster away and went back upstairs to the shower. I needed to make sure the wound was clean so it wouldn't get infected. I showered quickly on a high heat, and it looked like the bleeding was stopping, but as soon as I came out and dried my balls with the towel the wound reopened and blood trickled from it once more. 

Then, in a stroke of what I humbly describe as pure genius, a cunning plan came to me. I took a thick sheet of kitchen roll and hunted through the drawers for one of my sister's hair bobbles, proceeding to wrap my jewels up like a crispy [wanton] (http://www.khanapakana.com/showimage.aspx?img=/recipe/articlefiles/4ee865b0-cba8-4e61-8741-45090218cc46-Fried_wonton%2000.JPG&w=250&h=250) to soak any blood up till the bleeding stops, using the bobble to secure the kitchen roll in place. Thankfully I managed to find one tight enough to keep it together and yet loose enough that blood would still circulate. 

I sit here now typing this, with my junk looking like knockoff Eastern cuisine, not daring to see if it's finally over. I'm never *ever* putting scissors anywhere near my plums again.

EDIT - **TL;DR** Tried to trim my pubes, cut a chunk of my balls off. OH GOD THE BLEEDING. Balls now look like a party snack.

EDIT2 - UPDATE
I have spent most of the day with my girlfriend, being laughed at for cutting my bollocks like a moron. Unwrapped my testicle parcel and there was blood everywhere. All over my balls, and all over my underwear. Cleaned up and had to use a couple of her pantyliners (no I'm not joking) so the blood wouldn't reach my trousers. Have been out in town to buy steristrips and fabric plasters and had to go to public toilets to clean up twice, put them on and at long last the blood has stopped. Females of the world, never will I make fun of periods again. Putting up with the blood for a day has been miserable and embarrassing, and I didn't have any pain. I have no idea how you do it for a week every month.

Also, many thanks to /u/Arthane! I have never been gifted gold on here! This post is the most upvoted thing I've ever submitted to Reddit, and will be in my history at the top forever now. I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry."
39gi2y,non_TBI,"This is pretty short, but is easily one of the most embarrassing moments of my young adult life.

When I was about 14, during those awkward and interesting days of adolescence, I came home from school to an empty house, so I decided to hop in the shower. I used the shower in my parents' bathroom, because theirs was nicer — it was a walk-in shower with a glass door, and one of those 'rainfall' spigots.

Well, as I was cleaning myself, I started thinking about a girl I was attracted to at the time and... please don't judge me... I started kissing the shower door, imagining that I was kissing her.

So here I am, pressed up against the door, getting physically erm... stimulated... when, out of nowhere, my mother opens the door to the bathroom and finds herself face-to-face with her son rubbing up on and making out with the door to the shower. She just does a 180° and walks out.

About 10 minutes later, I head out and came up with some excuse that ""I slipped and fell"" onto the shower door. Her response? ""Well from the look of things it certainly must have been exciting for you.""

I have never mentioned it to her again."
2ur3fw,non_TBI,"My five month old kitten was napping beside me while I was laying on my side reading a book.

Felt a bit of a squeaker building up, and thought it would be funny to startle kitty with it. 

Spread my cheeks, and lined up my puckered brown eye to the back of kitty's head. I felt like Lee Harvey Oswald.

Let my little squeaker go.

It sounded like a Wookie coughing.

Poor cat shot about three feet high and six feet forward off the bed.

This was about three hours ago, and he still won't come out for his food and bolts as soon as I try to touch him.

So I write a nice friendly message and send it to about ten or so different girls.

hey, how's it going! :D
Haven't seen you in a while...how come? 

Both sentences are two separate messages, gives the impression that I haven't thought it through and its just a friendly, harmless message. Usually works, they won't think I'm trying anything on, right?

Wrong...as soon as I send it a single messenger thing pops up at the bottom of the screen with a group message containing all ten girls. I ACCIDENTLY CREATED A GROUP MESSAGE containing all ten girls and sent my message to the group.

The positive thing is I got replies from all of them...

the negative is all of them were along the lines of ""err..wtf"" and ""you do know we can ALL see this right?""

Probably deserve the creep status I now have.

**edit:**

I just left the conversation about thirty messages in. The last few messages looked something like this:

""freeeeak haha""

""Really, graciejiujitsu?""

""pahahahahaha, I know right? As if he even has a chance..lmao"" 

""Graciejujitsu has left the conversation."" 

They're probably still going.

Messaged them all privately:

""Not really too much I can say about that one, obviously that was pretty f*cking sleazy of me, so sorry I guess....lol""  

4 replied, 2 of whom had already messaged me being super cool about it and basically just being like mate that's so funny seriously what the f*ck were you thinking, the other 2 just being like yeah ok no worries shit happens. Of those 4 who replied only one of them is on my course. :/

No response from the other 5 who are all on my course...,  2 of whom were super bitchy in the group message, (although one of those two I did kind of sleep with then not really talk to afterwards in fresher's year so maybe she has the right to be). 

Now that its been a while and some have replied being cool about it, and I've at least got front page status for my FU, I'm just sitting here chuckling and really dreading tomorrow morning. It could be worse I guess.

Lol."
3u7yih,non_TBI,"*(POST THANKSGIVING UPDATE)*

**TLDR:** I posted a text message between myself and my husband that my mother took offense to and un-invited my husband and I to Thanksgiving and future holiday events. Also everyone and their brother got to see the drama.

This happened yesterday.

A little background:

Me: Veteran, morbid humor, tends to be the mediator of my family

Husband: Chinese, also has a US citizenship, has no family in America

Mom: SAHM (stay-at-home mom) whole life, very conservative, Christian, pro-'Mercia, admitted xenophobic

This year for Thanksgiving we're doing something new. Everyone is bringing a dish to pass around. I was assigned bean casserole but I wanted to bring something a little extra. Having trouble deciding I sent my husband a text to see if I could get any recipe ideas:

""Is there any holiday like Thanksgiving in China?""
His response:

""No... you know... because we didn't kill all the people already living there.""

This is the section of our conversation I had put up on FB. I had countered this response with a ""Haha very funny, ass."" sort of response, but left that out. I do this at around 12PM, get a couple  likes and responses that are also ""Haha, very funny, ass."" and I head into my meetings which will keep me occupied for the next 5 hours. On one of my trips to grab a thumb drive from my desk, I see my phone has blown up with FB notifications as well as texts. Not having much time, I glance at the latest text from my husband which says:

""People are sending me messages about your post. I never thought I would be part of a public Facebook drama. I am a little embarrassed. I was so careful.""

Instantly my heart drops into my stomach. I had not told him that I had decided to put this text up. I thought it was harmless, it made me laugh, it made some of my co-workers laugh when I had shared it with them - what in the world was going on? But I didn't have time to check I had to go back into a meeting that dragged on late for another 2 and a half hours. At this point, its close to 5PM.

Utter chaos. My mom had responded with a very aggressive reply to that post. Essentially she criticized my husband for speaking poorly of America, and how dare he imply that his home country was somehow above reproach from America. That if he didn't like it here he should GTFO. She even posted an article about 'terrible things' his country had done in it's developmental stages.

One of my sisters step in to tell her to stop being mean and she gets into an argument with her about how she's not being mean, she's just standing up for America and why does that make her the bad guy? My sister tells her it's not that she's standing up for America it's the words she choosing to use in order to do so- especially those directed at her children. For some context, here are a few of the many quotes from my mom in this FB status conversation:

""Yeah the asian history is so full of loving anti-war history. LOL idiots.""

""People who live in America, have American jobs and don't know what its like to live under communist/fascist/socialist rule. They make me sick, this is Thanksgiving. Thank GOD you live in America, THANK GOD for the military who has DIED for your ass to live free in America with the priveledges of the constitution, and STFU about indigenous Indians who got their ass kicked 300 years ago, but KICKED someone else's ass to live in the lands they lived in. And if you don't like it, like I said, go live in S. America, or Mexico, or back to asia. If they are so righteous with their own history.""

""People need to wake the f up and see how this hating on America seeps into people's minds and eventually turns a country into self loathing Americans.""

""it's humiliating that a SIL (son-in-law) would say something about the country that has welcomed him with open arms and given him advantages, then can say stupid crap like that. It wasn't funny.""

""if you don't like America's history and want to put Thanksgiving down....GTFO.""

"" Why is the person who points out anothers lack of common sense the bad person with you?""

""shouldn't put up stuff for all to see if you can't take the heat!""

""i don't like people crapping on America, have a real problem with it, I taught my children better.""

""well i talked it out with her father, and since we both agree that [Husband]'s hate post was political, the rest stands. Unless [Husband] would like to apologize for insulting this country?""

All this over a playful exchange that was in no way meant to be a political statement from my husband. English is his second language, he struggles sometimes to accurately express his thoughts and feelings due to his vocabulary. My mom - most people - don't know that he genuinely is concerned about what he says because he's afraid of articulating it incorrectly. Because of this, he often says nothing in the moment, and my later explain to me what he wanted to say but couldn't find the words.

 One couldn't be more mistaken to think my husband would say this sort of phrase with the idea it represented any sort of sociopolitical opinion that he harbored. He was going for a cheap shot laugh, which he succeeded. NBD (no big deal).

And I feel like I should mention this again... I am a veteran of the US military. So the idea that I have no loyalty towards this country is pretty laughable... and a little insulting?

So I post a response in which I say my husband will not be apologizing and I gave more background to the whole conversation and tried to explain it was said in jest and wasn't meant to be any sort of political jab to anyone. I also requested that if you have issues to message me directly about it or call me, and not make a spectacle in public for everyone to see.

His sister reads all these comments and calls him. His sister is in China. His dad is also on FB. I am freaking out because I do NOT want his family to see this.

We have friends messaging both him and me asking WTH is going on, are we okay, and offering to take us in for Thanksgiving if she's serious about not wanting us there.

During all of this, my mom messages me on FB and once again tries to argue about how what he said was anti-American and why was she in the wrong for defending America? 

I tried to explain to her 3 times the reason behind what he was saying, how it was innocent, and she was taking this too personally and literally and that just made her angrier.

As I was still at work, I had to cut the conversation short but told her I was very disappointed with her choice of dealing with this situation and I would let her know my husband and I's decision on what we would do for Thanksgiving.

So this morning I'm constructing messages to those who stepped into the line of fire that was my mother's words with an apology and thank you for trying to step in. I'm going to message my SIL (sister-in-law) and beg her not to say anything to their father.

And I let my mom know we would't be there for Thanksgiving.

And that's where I am right now. No reaction yet from my mom, but she's effectively told my husband he's not welcome to family functions right before Thanksgiving and Christmas. I'm just sitting her spinning not sure what to do next. I'm so upset that I can't pin down one emotion right now.

I'll update if anything happens over the next day worth reporting.

Yay holidays.

Edit: We've shared text messages from one another before without asking. I should point out, our FB is mostly college and close friends. We live pretty far away from folk. FB has become a bit of our ""we're still alive and this is what we do"" updater for these folk. Mom joined FB about 3-4 months ago and the drama started. She is a bit of a troll I've come to realize reviewing some of her comments on others statuses. So as strange as it might be to some, sharing tidbits of our convos is not unusual for our updates.

UPDATE: My mom responded with:

[""lol don't bother, I'm sure we can cover the casserole.  Enjoy your holiday.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3u7yih/tifu_by_posting_a_text_on_fb_that_may_have_ruined/cxd05nc)

Also, before I unfriended her she started posting all sorts of pilgrim and thanksgiving propaganda all over her page. Sigh.

POST THANKSGIVING UPDATE: 

We went to a friends Thanksgiving. It was very nice and drama free. I did miss the familiarity of my family Thanksgiving but ultimately my husband and I had a stress-free holiday weekend in which we reconnected with friends. 

Thank you for all the advice - both supporting us as a couple and those who objected to the whole situation. I really appreciate being able to see the view from all sides - to have both support to stand strong as well as the encouragement to have a forgiving heart. I feel this has brought my husband and I closer as well as opened my eyes to some things I've been compromising to keep the peace.

My mom - through my sister living at home who was not the one to say something to her - offered to make us soup from the leftovers from dinner. Knowing her, I feel this is her way of a 'peace offering' and to our true family fashion of rug-sweeping blowouts like this an moving along. 

We still have not spoke, I have not planned on speaking to her this week as I have work things to deal with, but I will keep an open heart and mind as we move closer to Christmas. Most importantly, this will start our dialogue of boundaries which is sorely needed.

Thank you again everyone and if something comes up for Christmas.... well I'll be back to let you know!

3xus3p,non_TBI,"This actually occurred about a year ago, when I was 29.  I was at my grandfather's wake.  He had wished that all of his grandkids (8 in total) would serve as the pallbearers.  My uncle (that had married into the family, and did NOT share the same last name as my grandfather) asked me to check the list of the names that he was going to give to the funeral organizer.  So I did, and the list looked like this:

John Smith (kids of the aforementioned uncle)

Jill Smith

Mary Smith

Dewey Delucio (me, sharing my grandfather's last name)

Amy Delucio

Ben Delucio

Samantha Delucio

Jane Delucio

The names looked fine, except for the fact that our last name is actually spelled with a capital L, meaning it was ""DeLucio"".  I gave a lighthearted, ""Well, I mean it's WAY off, they forgot the Capital L!""

My uncle gave a lighthearted laugh back, but then paused and looked confused.

Uncle: What do you mean?

Me: The ""l"".  It's not capitalized.  But we don't really care.

Uncle: What do you mean it's capitalized?  No it's not.

Me:... um... yes... I'm pretty sure I know how to spell my own last name.  You don't share our last name but I assure you, it's a capital ""L"".

It was at this point my uncle swore up and down that my grandfather spelled it with a lowercase ""l"".  We went to my grandmother, standing by my father, and asked her about which it was.  She looked confused, but stated that it was indeed a lowercase ""l"".  But my father suddenly started acting strange. 

It was then that my dad confessed to a 50 year old secret:  He said that our name was actually ""Delucio"", but that when he was in 3rd or 4th grade he decided he wanted to look cool, and capitalized the ""l"" on his own.  He never got caught, legal agencies apparently didn't notice/care, and the name stuck.

tl;dr: I've been living my father's lie for 30 years. "
3x2vbe,non_TBI,"This FU as most is not from today but is from yesterday... actually you could argue the FU is 3 years ago or even 4. 

Was in a fairly new relationship with a girl ""Tara"" for a few months while on a work term in my home town. Work term ended and i went back to school a few hours away. Within a couple months i had received a phone call from Tara telling me she was pregnant. I came home for the weekend and discussed what our plan was and she decided she was going to keep it. 

3 years later my step mom urged my dad that I should do a paternity test since she thinks the child looked nothing like me. Got the results back today and for the last 3 years i was financially and emotionally invested in a child that wasn't mine. Ends up Tara was sleeping around. Now i feel awful for the kid and don't know how to exit the scene. 

EDIT: Since this has been coming up in a lot of comments. I'm no longer seeing Tara for some time now other than picking the little one up every other weekend. I am going to try to ween myself out of their life and go on living mine. For the kid I hope she finds the real father but man thats gotta be an awkward conversation to start. 

EDIT#2: Thanks for all the support and suggestions. Thankfully I don't live in the US. As i mentioned I was in school out of the city so I wasn't as close to the kid as most people seem to imagine. Work also took me a ways away for some duration for the 2nd year. Since i was in school for the 1st year and a half i wasn't able to pay any child support during that time. I'm not asking for any of it back but i fully intend to cut payments from here on out. "
2u3vlv,non_TBI,"Nothing too serious but I felt pretty stupid.

I decided to pick up some McDonald's after class today. I get there during the lunch hour so of course there is a long line of cars ahead of me. I decide to kill some time by opening up the Reddit app on my phone. Before I know it I'm pulling up to the first window. It's right then that I realize something. *I never stopped to order my food*. So I look at the cashier and obviously I just drive off instead of having to explain to the her that I forgot to order my food like an idiot.

This happened minutes ago. I'm sitting in the school library on a computer. In the library there are clusters of six computers arranged around a circular table with each screen facing outwards. So I'm just working on some Electronics coursework when a gorgeous girl sits at the computer next to me. Now, my school has a particular reputation for having an extremely scarce population of hot girls, so I'm instantly aware. I look over and to my joy, I see she has her lanyard with her ID card (which we all have to carry) on the table in front of her, and I can see the name clearly. Trying not to shout for joy, I quickly grab my phone and type her name into Facebook. I don't have the Facebook app on my iPhone as I don't often use it and it would just be taking up space for no reason, so usually use on the mobile site in Safari. As her profile loads up, I check her picture and it's definitely her. Booya. Now here's where it starts to go wrong. I go to tap on the 'about' section of her profile to check if she's in my year group or the year above, but my stupid fingers accidentally tap the 'add friend' button. My heart leaps. I quickly try to tap it again to cancel the request, when my screen goes black and my iPhone dies. I'm always sceptical when I hear anecdotes where timing is this convenient but I shit you not this just happened. I can see her phone feet away from me on the desk to my right and I'm praying she doesn't pick it up. My profile picture is very recent and she'd know it was me straight away from her peripheral vision. 

Worst part is Facebook is blocked on the school computers so I can't use it to cancel the request. We can access Reddit by using 'https' but Facebook doesn't work. Any ideas? May have to run. Fuck.

Edit: Spelling

Edit: As I'm trying to get the courage to say something to her she grabs her phone and opens the flip case. I looked over and could see the friend request notification on her lock screen. She swipes left with the grace of a swan before I can grab my shit and run. I see my profile pop up. My dick is basically inside me. It dawns on her that the 0 mutual friends guy is me. She looks over for a good few seconds but I keep my eyes fixed on my PC. She quickly gathers her things and leaves. Just before she walks off I muster a 'sorry' but she gives me a 'wtf' look and semi-jogs out the library. I've never been so embarrassed. Looks like I'm gonna have to avoid the only hottie in this place from now on.


Edit: The idea of looking on Facebook was to check if she was the year above before introducing myself as I'd prefer someone my age, from observation relationships between year groups don't work well in schools. This was the only thing my retarded brain could think at the time. I'm sorry Reddit.

Update: Still no acceptance of said request. Will update in due course. 

Update 2: She hasn't accepted. To be honest I wasn't expecting it. It's game over boys. Thanks for the hate/support/gold, it has made me laugh a lot."
3a5f5i,non_TBI,"This happened around an hour ago. I have had time to let the blood, tears and shame wash from my soul in the shower.

Tonight I have a bit of a special evening with a girl I have been seeing so I thought I'd have a little clear up of my man forest using the clipper part of my electric razor, as is natural in these situations.

There is a particularly difficult part to this procedure which is the most commonly forgotten region of a man's body - the gooch (for those that don't know it's the bit between fun bag and poop hole). To get to this part it requires a very unflattering squat over the toilet, lifting man parts up, and peering under to see what you're doing. 

Music on full volume and concentrating intensively on not castrating myself what better than my estate agent accompanied by two innocent prospective tennants,  to see me, balls in hand, squatting over the toilet staring at my gooch, and singing ""riders on the storm"" passionately.

I forgot they sent me an email yesterday to remind me of this viewing.

I made a sound similar to that of a balloon being deflated whilst hold the neck closed. I also embedded the clipper into my gooch which was a perfect way to finish this voyeur.

So now I sit, after showering for what could have been years, with a plaster on my gooch.

I doubt I'll hear back from them. 

Edit: Riders ON the storm. I'm sorry Jim."
1wql2o,non_TBI,"Two friends on my Facebook list have near-identical names; they are literally only one letter off. Both are ""Diana K...""

One is a fitness instructor at my gym; the other is an enormous person.

""It's Diana's birthday!"" popped up in my feed, and getting confused and thinking it was the fitness instructor, I wrote: ""Happy birthday! I'm going to eat pizza, cake, and all other sorts of garbage so I can be just like you today!""

Because, you know, fitness instructor.

Ha-ha.

A week later, ""It's Diana's birthday!"" popped up in my feed again, and noticing it was the fitness instructor I wrote, ""How many birthdays do you have?""

Ten minutes later, it dawned on me...

Yup.

I felt like the world's biggest asshole."
300pun,non_TBI,"This TIFU happened a few weeks ago, but I'm new and just discovered this subreddit.

I love my sister, but she tends to make incredibly bad life decisions. I do my best to be sensitive and not to judge her or be condescending in anyway which is why she usually comes to me when she's f'd something up.  But this time I f'd up too, Reddit.

I randomly text her to see how she was doing.  She says not so great so of course I asked why.  That's when she said she really needed to talk to me, but she was afraid of what I would think of her.  I told her that if she needed to talk, I was here for her, that she knew she could tell me anything. She insisted that she was sure I would be disappointed in her.  

Trying to keep it light hearted because she sounded so upset, I gave her an extreme example of something I knew she wouldn't have done to show I could never be disappointed in her.  

I texted her back this, ""Sis, I love you no matter what. It's what sisters do.  Did you murder your children? Because that is literally the only thing you could do that might make me think less of you, lol.""

I have no idea why I said that, Reddit.  Because, I could have given any other crazy example like, ""if you murder SOMEONE"", or ""if you sleep with my husband"",  but no.  I had to say if you murder your children. She has kids, I have kids too, so it was the perfect example because I knew neither of us could ever harm a hair on our kid's heads. 

My sister texted back that she was pregnant and it was not her boyfriend's.  She wanted my advice about having an abortion.

Cue the longest apology via text ever.

UPDATE and CLARIFICATION :
I am a woman which makes me a sister. 
My sister has kids from a previous marriage. They are not the BF's. 
Technically,  I should have written  EX BF because he left.  They had been having problems for a long time. 
AFAIK, EX BF didn't know about the pregnancy  or cheating. 
And EX BF definitely would have known it wasn't his.  She wouldn't have nor could have passed the kid off as his.
She said she used protection.  
I don't know what she has decided to do.  
I did offer to help her anyway I could but only if she faced the music and told EX BF (He was not an ex at the time I made this offer.) and the father what happened. Because I believe that the father deserves to voice his opinion.  And who knows, maybe EX BF would have tried to make it work. Crazier things have happened.  In my experience,  coming clean results in better resolutions. 


TL;DR
Put foot in mouth about my sister murdering her children to find out she wanted to discuss an abortion after a one night stand."
29fp0h,non_TBI,"Was coming home Saturday evening after many, many beers with a mate. There's a brothel near my place and I was feeling drunk, horny and foolish, so figured what the hell and went in.

Ended up booking two hours with a young lady there. In amongst other things we made small talk and she mentioned that she was only 19 years old. I'm only 27, but even so I felt momentarily awkward about this new piece of information. Nevertheless we continued, and as the minutes passed she became more and more friendly, kissing me and generally making it into some kind of impromptu GFE. I found myself having a lot more fun with this girl than I was expecting. About half way through she offered to get me a drink, noting that she herself did not imbibe alcohol. When I inquired further about this she said alcohol made her a bit crazy and offhandedly noted that she preferred to smoke crystal instead. 

Wait, what?

I'm pretty easy going but even so I was taken aback. I mustn't have shown it however, because she soon returned both with a drink and a glass pipe, and asked me to join her. I don't know if it was the alcohol or the rush of the moment or severe lack of blood flow to the brain, but I simply nodded and said, ""Sure!"" 

Brimming artificial confidence and a libido on overdrive, we go at it like rabbits. Then she stops me with a sly grin and tells me that for a bit more cash we can continue sans the condom.

If it's not evident to you by now, I am a very poor decision maker.

Took her up on the offer because what could possibly go wrong, and commenced Act III. Afterwards, she gave me her number (is it just me or is that weird), I got home and passed out on the couch. Woke up the next morning and slowly began to feel a wave of horror wash over me as I remembered the events of the previous night, and the concerning number of firsts I had unwittingly achieved. And soon I will be taking part in yet another first: my first STI blood test.

32bpv9,non_TBI,"This happened a couple of months ago. 

While in the midst of having sex, we get the idea of me being blindfolded and my hands tied while she rides me. It feels amazing and, at the same, feel *incredibly* comfortable. Just laying down, enjoying it all, head resting on a pillow, unaware of how suddenly drowsy I felt. Slowly drifting aware without noticing.

All of a sudden...

**SNAP**

She *rips* the condom right off. This immediately gets my attention, as you can imagine.

""**YOU FELL ASLEEP WHILE WE WERE HAVING SEX!!!**""

""I... *did*??""

""Yes, I must be that bad, huh?""

""Wait, really? What, no!!""

Should be noted she was moderately insecure.

""Yeah, while I was riding you, *you started snoring*!""

""....uh^I^really^did^that?""

""And then I asked '*Are you sleeping??*' before ripping it off!""

""Oh^my^God,^I'm^so,^so^sorry!!""

2vnz47,non_TBI,"2 nights prior to a scheduled doc's appointment I had drawn a face on the top of my penis. I had used a black magic marker. 

When I am bored and drunk on vodka/cran-tangerine, sometimes I draw a face on my penis and then enact a sort of puppet show for myself. I just move it around and do a weird voice or whatever. Or I use it to talk to myself. 

Anyways I somehow forgot that I had drawn this face on my penis and I didn't realize it until the moment right before the doctor told me to remove my pants. 

I was thinking ""Oh...shit. I drew a face on my penis."" 

I asked the Doc if it was really necessary to examine my penis. He gave me an odd look. I felt compelled, in my idiocy, to just drop my pants. 

I have never been so shamed or humiliated in all of my life.

The Doc just said ""Um...."" but I guess his professional decorum or whatever prevented him from further comment. The rest of the visit was extremely awkward.

I will never visit this doctor again. NEVER. 

I will always wash my penis from now on the morning after I have drawn on it. Not washing the face off of the penis can lead to so many potential risks. I almost had a panic attack realizing this. Like, what if I was in a car accident? And they had to remove my pants or whatever? And all the emergency crew and doctor's would be seeing a face on penis? Oh my god. 

It's so awful. 

Oh god. What does this doctor think of me???

Shit!!!!!

Well that's how I fucked up. "
3uk071,non_TBI,"TL;DR Basically, i got into a wrong truck and drove across state lines.
Today, I drove to Oregon which is a good hour+ drive as I'm in Washington to go to the outlet stores.
I parked about 400ft away from the side of the mall and did my shopping. I was there a good hour as I had a plan of hitting 4 stores only for a few items and leaving. 
I make it to my truck and set everything in the back of the bed. I noticed some rude person had thrown a half full bottle of Pepsi and an empty cigarette in the back. I grumbled and unlocked the door and hopped in. I turned the ignition and my radio station comes on - just how I left it. No reason to really think otherwise. 
I drive an hour back to Washington and pull into my driveway. I start to put down my tailgate to unload what I bought - and I just froze -then I got pissed. On the bumper was a sticker that had some hippie quote on it. Thinking the perpetrator who put the Pepsi bottle and cigarette pack in the bed of my truck thought it would be funny to put a sticker on my truck. 
I happen to have a glass scraper in my glovebox from a painting job. I open my glovebox and shit bricks. Inside was a hairband (Im a dude with short hair), a photo of some strange kid (I don't have a kid), a dog leash (I own a cat) and a coupon book for a neighboring town that happened to be about 22 miles from my home. 
At this point, I am fully aware this was not my vehicle. I'm certain my heart stopped beating for a few seconds.
I Googled Oregon's police and notified them that I had just been at the outlet store and I believe I drove off with another person's truck by mistake - all the way back to Washington. They asked what year and model and the same year Ranger truck was ""stolen"" and gave them the license plate number to confirm. The officer said ""Coincidently, there is the same year and model Ranger parked two spots away with Washington plates, too. I take that is you car, can you confirm the license plate?"".
To make a long story short, I made it there in 40 minutes to the outlet store - right by an officer and a woman who waved me down. After the officer taking my ID and the owner's keys from me, the woman could actually make a joke about the situation. I jokingly asked her to see if her keys would start my truck: and they did. Found out she lives in the next town over by me. After filling out paperwork with the officer, I drove sheepishly back to Washington - in my own truck! So, readers of Reddit, TIFU by getting in the wrong vehicle and traveled across state lines.

My friend, a lady from and old italian family who works for theaters in Milan posts the following status on fb: 'there is an entire population in my head and I don't know who I shall listen to'.

I comment below 'listen to the old skank, she'll always tell you the truth' and go to bed.

Apparently her very aristocratic mother had commented seconds before me suggesting a selected genocide of the people in her head.

My comment appeared like I was inviting my friend to listen to her mother, an old skank who always tells the truth.

At that point, my brain stopped working, and I did not even see/comprehend the not in her sentence, and replied back to her ""You're not just any slut. You're my slut.""

So, I live in a pretty nice apartment building with a roommate, lets call him Tim. I met my girlfriend because a few years ago she moved into the apartment next door. Lets call her Hannah.

Anyway. I'm on the couch in the living room this morning when I'm eating a tub of ice cream. No shame really, just going to town on it. I dont ever tell Hannah when I have ice cream, because the moment she finds out its in my freezer, I have about t minus four seconds until it's gone. Tim and I have this kind of running joke about the fact that we don't tell our girlfriends about the ice cream we have because we don't want them getting fatter. Now, mind you, neither of them are fat at all, we just dont want to share the ice cream.

So I have about a quarter of the container left, when Tim yells ""Hey OP, dont you think Hannah would appreciate it if you shared some of your ice cream with her"" so naturally my response was ""if I give Hannah one more bite of ice cream she's going to be a clone of Rosey O'Donnell, so I'm gonna finnish this for her sake"". 

See, here's where I fucked up. Hannah was in her bathroom when I said this. And her bathroom shares a wall with my living room. So she heard every word of that. Now, I didnt know she was in there. But I assume she must've already been in there an hour because it took about twenty seconds for her to knock on my door, and we all know women can't pass throw the door of a bathroom twice in the same hour.

So anyways. Hannah knocks on my door. Immediately I knew she had heard that. The look on her face was not anger, it was just blank. So what did I do? I offered her the ice cream, you know, because I'm a dumb ass. So she takes the ice cream, and as if she briefly became possessed by Michael Jordan, launches it across my living room, and nets it right into the trash can. 

At this moment I thought one of two things was about to happen. Either my girlfriend was about to use the remaining magic spells she had left to slay me down like Voldemort cutting down harrys parents. Or I was about to do a really poor job explaining what I just said. Sadly, despite the incredible shot, Hannah was not really a wizard and I had explanations to give. So while I'm fumbling over my words, Tim looks this girl in the eye and said to her ""OP makes jokes about your weight to me so that I will feel better about never having a girlfriend as pretty as you"".

I dont know what sorcery this guy was using, but Hannah looks at me and says ""awwwwww, you really think I'm that pretty?"".

tl;dr my roommate is the greatest bro of all time. My girlfriend is probably a little slow.

Edit: We have reached the magical land known as the front page. I didnt know reaching this place was possible for mere mortals, but here we are, and it couldn't have happened without you guys

Edit2: Gold! Youre the best internet stranger 

Edit3: Tim is not black. Tim is the most pasty white person to ever walk the earth

Edit4: Tim is not a redditor, but I sent him the link to let him know he was the internet's white knight of the day. He had two things to say, ""why did you say lets call them Tim and Hannah when that's our real names?"" and that /u/vaaarr was definitely onto something and we're going to show Hannah this and see what happens. Should it end up being funny I'll make another post about it, but not until tomorrow, Monday is Chinese food night, and it's Hannah's turn to buy, so there's no way I'm risking that.

Edit5: Guys the joke was that I was going to town on a tub of ice cream and Hannah was the fat one. We seem to be missing this crucial piece of evidence, so I would like to point it out.

Final Edit: (I swear its the last one) okay so, I got home from work a few minutes ago, and as soon as I got back Hannah knocked on my door. She looked really worried and my first reaction was ""okay shes trying to get me back, don't buy into it"". So I ask her whats wrong and she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a pregnancy test. ""what is this?"" ""its my new ipad, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK IT IS?"" theres two lines on it, so she shows me on the thing it comes with that this means positive. so I'm freaking out and ask her what the hell we do. she tells me she already called her parents and they were pretty happy about it, but shes still really nervous. okay... yeah. I can call my mom. Except that my mom is incredibly religious. I could tell my dad, but he would make me call my mom and tell her, where as my mom will at least tell my dad. Okay one call is better than two.

""Hey mom, it's OP, I'm calling with news""
""Yeah what's up?""
""Well, uhhhhh, Hannah is pregnant""
..........................................
""I said Hannah is-""
""Yes, I heard you.""
""So uhhh, I'm gonna be a dad.""
""That's..... exciting""
""Yeah. So, you're gonna be a grandma.""
""Yes honey, I... I realize this.""
""Sooooooo, I guess that's it""
""Alright, I will, I will talk to you later""

I hang up the phone, and Hannah BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. What the fuck was so funny about that? 
""Oh I had a girl pee on it at lunch today""
""You had a pregnant girl pee on a stick so I would call my mom to tell her you were pregnant""
""No, I never thought you would call your mom and tell her, that was all you""

tl;dr (again, I know I'm sorry) girlfriend got me back big time. admitted to my religious mom I have pre marital sex. not going to really be a dad. oh well, I guess I deserved that one"
2tu60b,non_TBI,"and having another redditor find it. You forgot your phone at 7 eleven and you can meet me here at 2:30 to get it. I can't think of another way of contacting you due to your only two contacts being ""pizza"" and ""free ride"". You are now subbed to some *ahem* long and hard subreddits and I hope you enjoy that.  I also took a selfie with the cool cashier so that will be in your photos and as your wallpaper.

Edit:Just 40 minutes till I meet IMelted at 7/11.  Hopefully he saw this

Edit 2: 20 Minutes. Also everyone keeps wanting me to post the picture of me and the cashier but I really like to keep my identity to myself.  It will be up to IMelted if he wants to post a picture of him and the phone if he sees this and meets up with me but I'd prefer to keep my face to myself.  

Edit 3: Using up all this guy's battery posting :(

Edit 4: Tried calling ""pizza"" and it is a dead line

Edit 5: 2:30...No sign of IMelted but i'll stay for a half an hour.  I'm gonna shut off his phone due to 10 percent battery so no updates.  If he doesn't show up by 3:00 i'll kick it back on and update you all

Edit 6: Holy shit I just got my phone back from the guy at seven eleven! He told me to not use his name on reddit so I will keep referring to him as ""guy"". So before I do anything else I would like to explain why my contacts are only ""free ride"" and ""pizza"".  Free ride is my mom just like the one comment he put said.  I really am surprised that the guy didn't try and call free ride and I'm not sure his logic in not calling it but I didn't ask.  The contact Pizza is Domino's pizza so I have no idea why it was a dead line for the guy.  I only have 2 contacts because I just bought this phone about a week ago and the guy at my provider forgot to change over my contacts from my old phone so I've just kept with my 2 needed contacts (yes pizza is needed) until I can go back to the store and get them to transfer them. I found out about this post by (after freaking out that I just lost my new phone) checking reddit during my computer class at school. I logged in and saw I had a lot of messages that lead me to this post. We only have 1 seven eleven near us so I knew that was the one he was referring to.  I will try and answer any other questions you all may have.  I am just really appreciative that this guy did not just run away with my new phone and leave me screwed  - He went the extra mile to meet me at seven eleven and I am really thankful for that. I am home now and I will show you a picture of my phone (sorry I removed the background at his request, and I added a passcode!)

2qmrgt,non_TBI,"well not today-today but this is the first day I could write. 

So for Christmas I got my son a Swiss Army Knife along with a couple of other things. He wanted a butterfly knife but I had reservations... for a good reason. 

I gave him the standard ""this is not a toy"" lecture and made him watch The Simpsons where Bart gets a knife (The 10 Do's and 500 Don'ts of Knife Safety). Five minutes after lecturing him I'm attempting to put together my youngest son's TMNT Big Wheel when I come across some pieces held together by a zip tie. I grab that trusty Swiss Army Knife, and while again lecturing my son, I place the biggest blade to those plastic spawns of Satan. Not realizing how sharp the knife was I apply the teensiest amount of pressure and like a hot knife through butter, the blade cuts through the zip ties, plastic wrapping, my children's respect for me, and plunges into the hand holding those bastard parts. The only thing that stops the blade is the hard bone it dug into. 

I immediately apply pressure, my 3 yo is screaming at the sight of blood gushing onto his new toy, my wife is on the verge of fainting, and my daughter is wobbling on her new skates right next to that bloody blade. I shout at my oldest to ""get the knife, get the knife"". He's panicked, doesn't know what to do, picks it up and closes it on his pinky finger, efficiently slicing it. He's screaming, wife is done, daughter is oblivious, and youngest has successfully moved on to playing with his new Star Lord toy. 

TLDR: the only two Mexicans on the planet who don't know how to handle a knife. 

Edit 1: I've been narrated! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_jk0oIP974

Edit 2: because so many people are making the comment, the knife was for my 11 year old son. My 3 yo is whose gift I was attempting to assemble when I forever lost my children's respect and admiration. 

Edit 3: I made the front page. I love all of you.

2teh99,non_TBI,"I'll make this very short. Being the cool dude I am, I try my best to entertain my brother with autism. One thing he really enjoys is me reading TIFU's to him or other threads but his favorite thing are the comments. He looooves the comments. So.. If most of you haven't caught on by now, loads of people have realized that when in an awkward situation, peeing everywhere asserts dominance and makes you alpha as fuck. Well. Today my brother, while in school was scalded for not listening to his teacher who repeatedly told him to stop breaking the graphite off his pencil so he could just sharpen it again. He casually said, 'I'm the dominant person Mr. Jacobs,' dropped his drawers and urinated all down the cabinets and onto stacks of graded tests and medical forms for an upcoming field trip. Immediately blames me for teaching him how to be 'alpha,' and I get my lunch breaks taken away from me for 2 weeks. FML. 

EDIT: let's clear some stuff up. 
-My brother is actually a very smart kid, just he doesn't understand certain concepts. He thinks very differently than the normal person. 
-I mean that I lost the ability to eat with all my mates in the cafeteria and I eat it in the detention room.
-I got in trouble because, 'I was training him to blatantly disobey.' ....no way dick, 1.5+ thousand people agree with me that pissing on your papers is in fact a boss ass move and he deserves to be alpha male. I can read what I want to my brother. 
-My dad laughed so hard when I explained the situation to him and agrees that X is the man "
2uvb6b,non_TBI,"For once, this actually happened today. I work for a small start-up company, we only have a handful of employees. This morning I was driving to the airport and was on the phone with my colleague, let's call him Jesus for shits and giggles. 

Anyway, due to the small size of the company, we're all very informal with each other, and Jesus and I get on quite well. We go for beers together out of hours and have a good time. It's nice to get on with colleagues and actually be able to call them friends as well.

As I was saying, we were on the phone when I needed to pop into a petrol station to get fuel for my car. I told him that I needed to go because of this. He said ok and started to end the conversation. At this point my wife called. Yep. I'm a straight male, as is my colleague Jesus. Anyhoo, as I look at my screen which is telling me that my wife is trying to call me, and while simultaneously ending this call with Jesus, my brain decides to go into ""end call with wife mode"" and I hear myself saying"" speak later, love you...""
To which Jesus replies ""WTF....click""

I call myself stupid, fill up the car, then call the wife back, explaining to her what I just said to Jesus. She laughs and tells me to call him back and apologise. 

So, less than ten minutes after shaking with Jesus earlier  I do... And our office manager answers the phone, I ask to speak to Jesus, and just before she puts me through, she says ""speak later, love you....""

I get through to Jesus and he's laughing about it all. I apologise profusely but I realise at this point that it's all around the office already and from now on all calls will be ended with  ""speak later, love you"".... 


EDIT: some people seem to think he's actually called Jesus.

EDIT 2: some people still think his real name is Jesus. 

I think he found me. I'll find out when I speak to him in the morning.

And some fucker has gone through my comment history, replying ""Speak later, love you"" to everything. 


RIP IN PEACE my inbox.

EDIT 3. Shaking? Should be talking. Stupid Swype. 
It took over 12 hours for that to get noticed.

416y5l,non_TBI,"Not today, never today. This was roughly 10 years ago; however it is my biggest FU in high school.

On my first day of high school, we had physical education 10 for our first block. What a amazing way to start off the semester, Our school split up the classes so only males participated together and same with girls, Because of this there were two separate gyms in the school which we referred to as ""Gym"" and ""Small gym"". In order to get to the Small gym from the locker room You had to travel through the Gym.

Now seeing as this was the first day of classes, naturally we played dodge ball. I am truly competitive at sports and it is a burden sometimes, but I don't like to lose, or take it easy on people. Now while we were playing dodge ball, a classmate of mine named Anthony was destroying us. I knew him from the basketball team and he was a natural athlete (He actually plays in the CFL now!) so naturally at the beginning of each round I specifically sought to hit him square in the face to make him fall on his ass in front of the entire school, alas Anthony would live to see the day unfold.

The class was near ending and I wasn't going to let Anthony continue to embarrass our team; no matter how much skill he had. Nearing the end of the round the girls had finished up their class and were coming up from the small gym to go to the locker room. 

Now for some reason the girls decided to RUN ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT instead of simply walking around the ends of the gym as if it were some kind of game; to not get hit by the dodge balls, Completely not seeing this starting to happen at all (Because of my blood lust) I saw my opportunity. Anthony was just running up to the midway point to throw with his back toward me; Perfect I thought. His mortal life ends now.

I used every muscle in my body and ran towards the mid way point, Cocking my head back like a MLB pitcher I threw the ball with all my might, Anthony was doomed.

As I was watching the ball leave my hand I saw from the corner of my eye a girl who had already started running across the court. It was too late. I unknowingly had set this girls fate, and sentenced her to the shadow realm.

When the ball hit her dead square in the face, the result of the momentum from the ball knocked her backwards to where she hit the floor face first.

**BOOM**

You could not hear a single thing, it seemed like the entire world had stopped for a moment of silence for this poor girl. Her friends rushed over to her in fear of her death, only to find here laying on the ground sobbing in tears, while literally everyone else in the gym including the teachers stood there silently. She stood up with the assistance of her friends and ran out of the gym crying.

""**wow, Your an asshole Rank1** "" jokingly says my friend in the background.

It wasn't surprising that in my second block that I got called into the office, But I was not in trouble. I told my side of the story, and from my gym teachers it was roughly the same; as we believed it was her fault.

I apologized at the principals request, and she never talked to me again.


TLDR: Hit girl in face with dodge ball, made her cry and go home on her first day of high school. Seriously read the post.


Edit: this blew up, I'll fix some spelling mistakes when I get home. Thanks for reddit gold; although I have no idea what it does. Inbox me some pictures of cats please. I'll do my best to answer questions and

3vj0bi,non_TBI,"Like the majority of stories here, this didn't happen today. Here it goes.

My cousin has a cabin right next to our house, and every once in a while, him and his family would come to visit the cabin and we would hang out. My mom had this old creepy babydoll that looked like it had the soul sucked out from it, so we thought it would be funny to prank his dad with it. We found a broom and tied the baby to the end of it so we could lift the baby up to the living room window. Now it looked like this creepy-ass babydoll was hanging in the air by nothing. This would surely scare his dad. Or so we thought...

We left it there overnight, and the next day we went over to their cabin to hear what their reaction was. Apparently they had visitors with them, who were the first people to wake up. Now, this seems like a pretty harmless prank, but the fuck-up was that the family had a miscarriage, and now the first thing he wakes up to see is a lifeless floating baby hanging in front of the window. He apparently had to take valium to calm down. We felt pretty shit afterwards."
2wvbbm,non_TBI,"Obligatory this didn't happen to me today, but about a week ago.

Let me set the stage a little bit for those who don't know about video games. A squeaker is what we in the gaming world like to call a young male who has yet to hit puberty, but still likes to graphically describe the sex he had with your mom. He also loves to rage and yell obscenities that I am suprised someone this young knows their meaning or even their existence. 

Now the fuck up... 

I was playing black ops 2 and the day had not been going well. In an attempt to unwind, I decided to fire up the trusty ol' ps3 and play a few rounds. One of these little fucks was in the very first match. Right from the get go he was full-blown raging. And I don't mean the ""Oh fuck you"" rage I mean the stand up, yell, throw shit rage. Well about 2 rounds in, his parents must have came home because he suddenly stated whispering his threats and insults and his various ""your mom"" jokes. I decided to get him back. I first started by annoying him in every possible way. Once he was sufficiently annoyed, enough that he was back at a half whisper half shout, I stared giving him ever opportunity to use the ""your mom"" insult. Well at some point he finally got so fed up with my shit that he lost control and went on a full tirade about how he fucked my mom and anal and blah blah. Well in about 0.2 seconds his dad comes racing down (or up) the stairs and starts unloading on the kid. I mean the poor guy I almost felt bad for him. I convinced myself that the little twerp deserved it. That was, until I heard his dad drop the you're adopted part.... In his full rage and fight with his kid the dad said ""your opinion doesn't even matter because you were adopted."" This was obviously the first time the kid had heard this because right after the dad said this there was complete silence. I then heard the mom yell from wherever she was for the kids dad to come back and talk to her. I exited the lobby after 5 mins of complete silence minus the kid bawling his eyes out...

TL;DR: You're adopted

Edit 1: Thanks for the responses! As many of you have suggested, I will probably be posting this in /r/revenge soon, but as I am currently at a funeral with hardly any cell service so it won't be for a little while.

Edit 2: Many of you are suggesting that this story is fake. And to those people, I apologize that I have no video to go with this, but I assure you that this actually happened.

Edit 3: Thanks random stranger for the gold! And to anyone who STILL doesn't believe me, then you haven't played any or enough CoD to know the mentality/actions of these squeakers. Anybody who actually plays will know that this is entirely possible.

Edit 4: As this happened a week ago, I don't remember how the your adopted part came out, but I seem to remember it being something along those lines. And as for the mic not being able to pic those sounds up, yes if it was a headset but I believe it was a playstation eye because I could hear his game echoing in his mic as well.

3ki84d,non_TBI,"So I'm an easy going gal. I let guests and their partners stay at my house as they wish. I let them utilize the house however they may... but that stops today. 

I let two stay over and they arrived when I was at work. When I came home they were in my room and I kindly escorted them to the guest room. I rarely ever saw the two, they'd typically be in the room or scavenging for food. What I wasn't really expecting was for them to partake in some shower sexy time. 

I've been going to the gym 5 days a week so I use their showers. Weekends are cardio days so I run to work and shower there. My guests left after a week and I decided to take a day off from the gym to clean the house. And then came the  glorious moment of showering in my own shower. The steamy water, massaging jets, aromatic soap.... and my loofah. It has been at my house waiting for weeks for me to suds it up. 

Without hesitation I load it up with soap and lather away. It takes me moments to realize something isn't right. Babies. Little baby spiderlings all over my torso, upper body, and right arm. Drowning... hopeless, disgusting, 8 legged freaks. Mashed up, mangled and dispersed on my skin. Why I ever let the angsty, scandalous spiders stay in my house is beyond me now. Fuck yo reproduction system, fuck yo choice of nesting and apparently fuck my hospitality.

Tl;dr: don't actually have friends. Spiders were the guest. Let spider guests stay in my home, loaded egg in fluffy loofah, ended up with spider babies on me."
2le1r7,non_TBI,"My parents are from South Korea, but I was born in the United States. Last week, I got to visit my native land for the first time. My grandmother (who still lives there with other family) thought that, at age 16, I was loooong overdue to see where I came from. She’s always encouraging me to get in touch with my roots, because I’m sadly what *King of the Hill* calls a ""banana."" (Yellow on the outside, white inside.) She took us out and encouraged us to eat a lot of South Korean foods I’d never tried. Some were delicious, others I pretended to like as they secretly repulsed my Americanized palate.

One dish that especially turned my stomach was the sannakji, a whole tiny octopus, legs cut off and served ALIVE. Not wanting to upset grandmother, I gave it a try. It was kind of bland, but not horrible. Wait, no, here came one little surprise for me: The legs may have been severed, but they can still ATTACK! The suction cups grabbed hold of my cheeks like there was no tomorrow, and I would’ve choked if my father hadn’t reached in my mouth and yanked the things out. Thank god it didn’t get all the way into my throat.

The dangers of this dish are apparently well known, with people being encouraged to chew it thoroughly, but a dumb American girl like me was totally ignorant to this. An internet search tells me that six people a year die from eating sannakji. There’s a warning label on my shampoo, but not on this thing??

Let me just say, as a young Asian woman, I did NOT want to be remembered for getting killed by a tentacle monster."
3is33c,non_TBI,"Recently, I decided to scare my boyfriend. I wanted to get revenge for the amount of times he has jumped out on me wearing one of those f*ing terrifying Guy Fawkes masks.  

He had just started a new job and I was home alone.  I found the mask and put it beside me, ready to put it on just as I heard him coming up the corridor.  I hadn’t really planned much further ahead than that to be honest. 

Several people came in and out of the building and I had no way of knowing whether or not it was him, so I was repeatedly putting the mask on… waiting… and taking it off.  After about 10 times I decided I’d just keep it on and put up with it until he got home.   

So I sat there with the mask on for a few minutes and couldn’t stop laughing about his imminent reaction.  I ended up needing the toilet.  For obvious reasons I decided it would be best if I went before he came through the door.  So I crept off to the bathroom.   Our light is attached to the fan, and not wanting to alert him to the fact I was home I decided to turn on the silent hallway light instead.  The light came through the frosted window in the door so I could just about see what I was doing.

When I was done, I approached the sink to wash my hands.  Out of habit, I looked up to see myself in the mirror and was greeted by a dimly lit, grinning Guy Fawkes mask that I had momentarily but completely forgotten about.  In sheer terror I screamed, fell backwards and almost knocked myself out on the wall before scrabbling to escape from the darkened room… making it all the way back to the living room before realising exactly what I had done.  He got home 10 minutes later.

I’ve not tried scaring him since.

TL;DR: I tried to scare my boyfriend with a Guy Fawkes mask and ended up terrifying myself instead.

--

EDIT: I'm having the best time reading through the comments and despairing at myself.  Here are some answers to some of the questions.

How did I forget I was wearing the mask?
Short answer, I'm just that kind of person.  But yeah.. I don't know it was weird.  I usually wear glasses so I'm used to stuff being on my face and I guess the bathroom was dark.  I was also thinking more about how hilarious it was going to be for me than how terrified he would be.

Why is the Guy Fawkes mask scary?
I find the Guy Fawkes mask the scariest out of all the masks I've come across and it only has to be left on a table for it to upset me. It's scarier to me than clown faces, dolls faces or any of that supposedly creepy stuff.  V for Vendetta is an amazing film, but it gives me the creeps for days.  Needless to say I don't watch horror films.  I also don't like being home alone.

How did it take so long to realise?
I'm in a little flat so it only really took about 10 seconds for me to get out of the bathroom and into the living room.  I know it's still a ridiculous amount of time but it wasn't 10 minutes before I realised.

Did I tell my boyfriend what had happened?
I was still trying to recover when he came in the door, going from trying to breathe to laughing at myself.  So I couldn't really get away from telling him the story and getting laughed at.

Why do I shut the bathroom door when I'm home alone?
The door is on one of those hinges that automatically swing shut.  I have a doorstop but it's fiddly and I was desperate."
3m0jj6,non_TBI,"This happened about 90 minutes ago... and yeah.


So my mom has been redoing her backyard and my wife and I have been helping out. Well we're wrapping up for the evening and my mom asks me to move this big black rolled up plastic whatever it is that is basically a big black tube. So I pick it up by one end and this **giant** fucking spider is underneath and proceeds to dash toward me. Naturally, like any grown man, I dropped the tube and screamed like a little girl. And señor face eater thought it would be a good idea to take up residence inside the giant tube.


Well, like all spiders, this bastard needed to die. Being the genius I am, I grabbed a can of mosquito repellent and a lighter. I proceeded to flamethrower the inside of the tube. Well... it didn't work as intended. Not only did the plastic tube thingie catch fire, but a giant pissed off spider that is covered in flames darted out of the tube toward my face. I proceeded to run and scream like a little girl as a flaming spider chased me like some bad horror movie.


My wife thought it was hilarious, my mom was annoyed I destroyed her plastic thing, and I never found the dead spider. So... somewhere out there is a pissed off, horribly disfigured, giant spider with a grudge. I may have created a super villain.

Edit:

Well this got bigger than expected. I guess I will answer some stuff up here.

The spider was a large brown spider, maybe and inch or so big. So giant. Also that fucker was fast.

The plastic tube was some rolled up garden mesh stuff.

Yes I sprayed fire at plastic... I never claimed to be intelligent. My genius comment was sarcasm.

I dunno if the spider was ever actually on fire. But everything else was, it darted right towards me, I dropped everything and ran like a true man.

Yes I really screamed like a little girl. Spiders suck.

No, I am not in Australia."
3dda86,non_TBI,"During our fortnightly meeting, an upcoming maternity leave was announced. 

We segued onto the topic of waters breaking. Another colleague explained that when she used to work as a bartender, a lady's waters broke.
Fortunately this had occurred in the beer garden (outside area of the hotel/pub). We asked how she cleaned it up,  she said it was just left as is, due to the fact it occurred outside on a patio area. Hosing the area down was suggested, but she shook her head and said it was fine to leave it alone.

At this point I stupidly said ""And that's how you get ants"".
No one watches Archer except me, my colleagues all think I was being gross/disgusting.

TLDR: quoted Archer when discussing waters breaking. Except no one realised I was quoting, they think I crossed the line."
43ecay,non_TBI,"Alright! The other day i was having a few drinks with some buddies, After awhile (3:00 a.m) i leave. On my way home i pass my friends house, We are gonna call him Fred. At the time i thought it would be a grand idea to stop in unexpectedly, I don't know why i wanted to go but i just did. I'll tell you how this turned into a shit show.

I walked up to the house and i thought i saw Fred at his computer in the front window, He **ALWAYS** has his front door unlocked and the door handle is broken, It's very hard to open sometimes. I shut the door behind me and look into the living room where i believed he was sitting, Well no one was there. At the same time a door closes up stairs. I moved toward the bottom of the stairs and look up to find myself staring at a floating dick in the dark. My situation is me standing in Fred's house with a mysterious wiener staring me down from upstairs. Nothing moves for a solid minute, Just awkward wiener staring and trying to break down what i walked into. After all that the wiener just takes off after me down the steps. Instantly i turn around for the door but, The door handle isn't working properly and i'm stuck trying to get out of the house. By some dumb luck the door opens and i'm sprinting towards my car a bit down the street. I look behind me while running to his Fred's dad chasing me with no clothes on, I stay focused to my get-away and turn to my objective. The car was half a block away. The only thing i heard was this guys johnson smacking his thighs as he ran, Couldn't help but laugh uncontrollably as i got into my car and started it. Fred's dad still hauling ass, I start my car and shift it into drive. Before i could step on the gas i look to my left and see his dick all over my side mirror and window as well as him hitting the top of my car. Drove home and never told Fred of what went on. He did tell me that someone broke into his house though. 

TL;DR Went to a buddies house at 3 a.m, got chased by a naked guy.

388u2s,non_TBI,"Yeah, it's pretty much a ""half of my life"" fuck up.

I do all the cooking at home, and I love it.  But I'd always been frustrated that whenever I made rice, it always came out in sticky clumps, never the lovely fluffy clouds that I wanted.

Why?  I never rinsed the rice grains beforehand.

Just last weekend I finally did this and voila: a bowl of fluffy delicious rice that doesn't have the texture of freshly mixed epoxy.

Yep, I've been making shitty rice for almost four (edit: three) decades until I finally realized that I should probably follow the directions.  5 extra minutes of extremely easy prep, and I was too fucking lazy to bother.

Damn, I'm dumb!  And stubborn!  And lazy!

Better late than never, I guess.

Edit 1:  I should have clarified that I usually on buy Basmati or Jasmine rice from Trader Joe's.  Don't know how much of a difference rinsing would make with other kinds.  BTW, it should be about thirty years.  Yeah, I can't tell time either!  I'll be forty six in July.

Edit 2: HOLY CRAP.  Front page!  What a great feeling to know that such horrendous apathy unabated for decades could reap such ephemeral rewards.  I feel like Patrick Star!  "
2qzntq,non_TBI,"My dad and my six-year-old sister often have playful ""fights"" about who my mom likes better. It's kinda stupid, but she's a kid so whatever. I was home for new years, and I hear my sister and dad at it again, jokingly making up silly ways why Mom likes either of them better.  It usually goes along these lines:

sister: Mom likes me better!
Dad: nuh-uh, she made me bacon for breakfast!
sister: Well she let me [insert activity fun for a kid]
Dad:Yeah well she let me [one ups my sister playfully]

Eventually they moved into the living room where I was sitting and I hear my sister say to my dad:

""Well, I'm so close with mom, I've been *inside* her [referring to being in her womb as a baby]"" to which I stupidly interjected: ""Yeah well so has Dad."" She looked really confused, as if actually contemplating the idea that my mom had birthed my dad.

To clear that up and prevent further misunderstandings, today my six-year-old sister learned about sex."
3zt4gl,non_TBI,"Allow me to set the background for this tale. It was my best pals 22nd birthday on the 27th of December. He decided he wanted to suit up and hit up Glasgow, visit a casino and do a pub crawl. By the time we got back to the train home the party of about 10 of us including his sister and dad are all pretty drunk.

We all take seats that are just next to the toilet. The toilet has a sliding door in a quarter circle shape that automatically slides open and shut by a set of two buttons on each side of the door. The door is also visible all the way down the train carriage which is packed with people just as merry as we were that night. 

Anyway being the wee annoying drunk dick I am, whenever one of us went up to use the toilet, just as the door is about to slide fully shut I would press the ""open"" button adding to the carefree drunken banter of the night , the set of buttons is just by my head at the seat I'm sitting in, obviously once the door is fully closed it can be locked from the inside. 

So this frivolity carries on for a while even with just random folk on the train until the game changes completely. A tiny little old woman with a walking stick comes hobbling up the carriage, a poster child for osteoporosis, and makes for the toilet. Those of the squad that was standing politely move out way. This is sadly the only courtesy she's going to get. 

She slides the door shut and normal conversation resumes. Maybe a couple minutes go by and note to my friends that vacant sign is still lit and she hasn't locked the door and in all honesty said ""should probably make sure nobody opens that"" 

But alas at that moment I seen a shiny black object in my peripheral heading for my head, I turned around to only see my friends well polished black shoe stop short of my ear but hit squarely on the ""open"" button. Things are in slow-mo, I look round at my pal who has just done this terrible deed with a shit eating grin on his face and back round to see the door slide open to reveal a old woman, pants around her ankles taking a shite in full view of the entire train carriage. 

Like a dear in highlights she freezes for second and and then promptly closes the door. Once the intial shock passed I tried to scold my pal, I wanted to be angry at this point give him hell. ""What the Fuck are you playing at mate!?"" Was supposed to come out in angry conviction but my voice cracked eventually there's tears rolling down my face and everyone else is in hysterics apart from my friends Dad who has fled in embarrassment. However things don't end there. 

The woman was still on the john and things had calmed down a little when all of sudden this drunk old guy out his nut comically dressed in double denim came swaggering up non detected by us and before anyone could say ""aww here mate don't bother pressing that bu..."" The door wooshed open a revealing this woman on the bog a second time. 

This big guy shat himself (figuratively) shut the door and high tailed it down the carriage in embarrassment. Leaving the rest of in renewed hysterics and guilt. 

Before long she emerges from her cage of shame and walks by a group of young men suited in there Sunday finest trying to unsuccessfully trying to stifle there laughter and rightly says in her Glasgow accent

""yous lot should be damn ashamed of yourself"" 

Which I feel like saying I was, truly. But the comedic effect of a sliding door opening and revealing a old woman indisposed overcame any shred of decency I had. 

But the story doesn't end there

A short while passes and the woman returns this time with company,could be daughter or carer. The old woman once again returns to the toilet while her friend makes the shape of a angry star fish outside the door, protecting protecting this old woman's last few scraps of dignity, who upon entering the bog again has repeated her fatal error. 

Now this woman is seething with rage, giving everyone an earful and threatening police action against all of us and anyone else down the carriage that is laughing. I'm still holding back tears of laughter as are my companions. All eyes on the train are on this woman as she goes on tirade that we are discriminating against her old disabled friend. To which the actual first offender replied. 

""Mate, It would be discrimination if we didni fuckin laugh at her and plus it's not our fault she hasn't locked the door in the first fuckin place""

She replied with ""of course she has fucking locked the door! LOOK!""

And with the conviction that only a pissed middle-aged woman can muster, she battered the open button with the side of her fist. Once again revealing this poor old indisposed woman sitting on the bog for the third time. 

""Oh for fuck sake Agnes"" the middle-aged woman shouts at her poor old friend. ""You said you fuckin locked it!""

The train erupts at this point. I don't think I've ever cried with laughter harder in my life. The final blow is dealt

The hangover after that night was ridiculous. The whole day after I was convinced I might be some horrible morally ambiguous monster but having told the story a few times now it's never failed to make folk laugh. So I'd thought I'd share it with you guys

TL;DR. laughed at poor old woman caught indisposed 3 times 
"
41oskl,non_TBI,"Obligatory happened a few years ago. I'd just gotten married, and I had one final semester of college left. My advisor recommended that I take an online course called ""Electronic Journalism."" It was actually really awesome. We made .xls files and uploaded them to googlemaps and made huge pinpointed charts. 

One assignment required us to match a phony list of 5,000 IP addresses to a phony list of like 10 child pornography IP addresses to see if a certain employee at our company was watching it at work.   

I downloaded the assignment (an excel file with two separate sheets) as ""Child Porn IP Addresses."" I left it on the desktop and left for work before my wife got home. 

While at work, I get a text telling me that we really need to talk about something as soon as I get home. 

I get home, and my wife has a list that she believes to be 5,000 IP addresses for child porn sights. She'd been very upset the entire night but hadn't actually checked any of the IPs. I explained it and things were okay, but she deeply regretted marrying me for a short time.

Tl;DR: I was trying to get through college to get a degree, but my wife thought I was more interested in going to elementary school. "
2gpraf,non_TBI,"Reddit, I love you and all, but you made me fuck up bad. I've been a lurker for quite some time, but I've got nothing else to do and I figured this story was too good to pass up.

**The story:**

I work in an older office building, and occasionally have to answer the calls of mother nature. Pooing at work wasn't great until to weeks ago when I finally got a smartphone. I started browsing Reddit on the can as soon as I got it, and at work I retreat to the hidden restroom stall in my building to do the deed. It's private there and I've spent upwards of 20 mins redditing when I was supposed to be working.

Today was a little different. The last few nights I've been caught up in watching Scrubs on Netflix and haven't gotten much sleep. So today when I went for my ""End of Shift Poo"" I drowsed off a little while redditing. I finally woke up when a janitor (custodian or whatever is PC) came in to ""clean."" He knocked on the door and asked if anyone was still in here. Of course, too embarrassed to say I had been sleeping on the toilet for hours, I quietly hid in my stall. He immediately left without cleaning the place, I guess because  it didn't have much traffic. I waited about five minutes to leave, got up, washed my hands, and tried to leave.

 To my surprise, the door was locked. Apparently since my office building is really old and the bathroom I'm in wasn't always a bathroom the door had a lock on it that has to be locked daily. I've tried everything, I'm on T-mobile so as you can imagine, there's no service. I've sent out some emails to my boss and maintenance ... but who checks their email after work anyway. 

So now all I have is Reddit to entertain me until someone unlocks the door.

EDIT 1: I appreciate people trying to help. As you can imagine I don't want to many people to know about this so I'd like to avoid the fire dept or police. I also know I'll be free tomorrow so its not like its a big rush. 

Also, I don't have the phone number of any one with access so that's out. I don't want the police or anyone involved.

EDIT 2: I'm going to try making calls see where it gets me. I'll call the building, maybe some coworkers.

EDIT 3: I'm working on 26% battery, I charged it before I left my desk. I'm fighting with imgur on my phone but I promise pics ASAP. I'm working on plans for sleeping. I've got some snacks in my bag.

**Here's the lock. Pretty standard stuff:**
http://i.imgur.com/zr0klKp.jpg?1

**The view from my throne(I'm still not comfortable with an open stall door):**

http://i.imgur.com/PBgwcmc.jpg

**Hopefully the last edit:** I finally called the building. I had to call 6 times before a security guard picked up. He's on his way. Thanks everyone for the support!

**UPDATE:** Finally got out. The security guard was not as happy to see me as was him. He escorted me out of the building and I'm GOING THE FUCK HOME. I might do an AMA to explain everything if people are really that interested. I can't imagine they will be. So goodnight Reddit, thanks for being here with me. Maybe I won't have to work tomorrow."
2wgztb,non_TBI,"Today's fuck up has roots about two weeks ago. I was walking around the upper part of my university's campus and there was this LGTBA club basically obligating people to take condoms, and if you don't they purposely make you feel really uncomfortable. So because I learned through watching that you should not reject these condoms I took the 15 they offered me and tossed em in my backpack.

  Now keep in mind that these are like, pride condoms; They have rainbows and **hugging shirtless-happy-multiracial-buff-men wearing suspenders on the wrapper.**

  Today I was in my music theory class and near the end I needed my planner to write some upcoming assignments up. Little did I know about 8 or 9 condoms were between the pages and stuck to the planner. 

   I leaned over to my backpack, grabbed the planner, and yanked it out. Sooner that I could react there was rainbow of colored condoms and shirtless minorities gently soaring across the room in a gesture of pure flamboyance.  

  **TDLR: Pulled my planner out of my back pack too fast. Condoms, condoms everywhere.**"
2wmi7k,non_TBI,"So here I am, just got off work, drinking a beer, standing in this amazing hot shower and browsing reddit on my phone. My wife is asleep and refuses to wake up even though she promised to sex me up in the shower when I got home. She just walked in butt naked and slides the door open to step in and stops. ""Are you really on your fucking phone? ....ARE YOU ON REDDIT??""

""Uhhhh.... Yes?""

She just turned around and walked back out.

So here I am. Enjoying my hot shower, cold beer, and browsing reddit. I hate you guys."
16913n,non_TBI,"So, this happened two weeks ago, but I'm only getting out of the hospital yesterday.

Here goes, with a throwaway cause you'll see..

Here I am, day 6, the pipes are clogged, not even gas is able to escape this. Doctor (on day 5) said to take some laxatives, no effect, the urge is great, the pressure is extreme, and the pain, my god the pain. But he said, whatever you do, let it come naturally, and don't force, you don't want to hurt yourself. (He also said go to the ER if nothing after morning attempt)

So here I am, morning after taking a ton of laxatives the doc gave me the day before, still nothing, except the laxatives, overnight made things way worst, I swear to god my stomach was twice it's size, and I felt like it was going to explode.

So I'm sitting on the can, approaching hour 3, I felt a bit of movement, and decided to ""push"", and low and behold, after 15 minutes of pushing, I get this HUGE relief. I finally had a crap! Then came the spine chilling feeling, my inards felt like ice, my spine went numb, my legs go numb. Thinking I was just sitting there too long, i go to wipe, and I hit something. I stand up a bit to see something dangling from me.

It was my colon. I forced my asshole right out of my body. Freaked out by having a 1.5ft piece of asshole hanging out of me, I called an ambulance, and off to the hospital I went.

I was in the hospital from new years eve until yesterday night. On new years day I seen my doctor who told me not to force. I told him what happened, and he said, that's why I didn't want you to force, you have a chance on big blockages like that to detatch parts of your intestines and it can come out with the poo. Well shit.

So here I am, 3 operations later, sitting on a doughnut for the next 6-8 weeks, shitting in a bag for the next 3. All because I forced when I shouldn't of.

TIL: Don't force out a crap when you are extremely constipated, you might shit out your own ass.

TL;DR: I shit out my own asshole.

So, lots of people are telling me my spelling is shit. It's shit cause it's my 3rd language, and I don't give two shits. Please realize that some people in this world speak different languages before English. "
327y30,non_TBI,"Went to take a poop. Everything was fine except it took some extra effort to get it out. Went to wipe and noticed a decent amount of blood and no poop on the toilet paper. Freaked me out because I've heard this can be caused by prostate cancer. Looked down at the poop in the toilet, no blood in it. Really confused me. Only thing I could think of was to set my phone on the bathroom sink propped up so I could take a video of my own ass hole. Took the video, did not see any blood anywhere.

 Later on in the day I had accidentally left my phone sitting on a counter at work that is sort of a public gathering place. When I leave my phone unattended it's set to go to the lock screen 20 seconds after no activity. A co-worker of mine must have grabbed it right away and started looking through my phone. Of course he goes to the picture section first which is also where the videos are located. Starts playing the first video which is me showing my own ass hole to my own camera. From my desk area I hear a mixture of hyena laughter and horrified groans. 

By the time I reached the public gathering space I saw my boss and three of my co-workers watching a video on a phone. Instinctly I reached for my phone to make sure I had it and sure enough I didn't. My heart sank. The co-worker who went through my phone looks at me and says ""HA HA HA DUDE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?"" and my boss looks at him sort of confused. Once my boss had realized what he was watching and that the phone did not belong to who was holding it he immediately called us both into his office. 

He fired my co-worker on the spot; right in front of me. Told him to pack his things and that he would be escorted out. When my co-worker left the room my boss looked at me and apologized for the invasion of privacy. I could tell he was trying to hold back all of his laughter, questions, etc. He told me to go on about my day as if nothing happened and that if the other two co-workers mentioned it, he would put an end to it. I'm assuming he wanted to get this over with quickly so that I wouldn't end up suing the company somehow for emotional damages or whatever. I actually explained to him what happened and he said something along the lines of ""Well that's more information than I wanted to know but that makes more sense than actually wanting to look at your own ass"". We both kind of awkwardly laughed and went back to business. 

Now I'm wondering if that co-worker is going to post a ""TIFU by looking through my co-workers phone"". 

TL;DR My co-workers think I'm aroused by my own ass hole
"
3jmmdp,non_TBI,"Using a throwaway account for this. Earlier this week I was in class preparing to do my history presentation in front of everyone. I already suffer from extreme stage fright and the idea of standing in a crowded room talking about the fucking Zulu war scared the shit out of me.


When it was my turn to deliver my presentation I stood up and slowly walked to the top of the classroom holding tightly onto my flashcards to stop my hands from shaking uncontrollably.


As soon as I turned around to face everyone there was a still silence followed by loud gasps and deafening laughter. I thought it was due to something that happened at the back of the classroom that I missed out on.


When the laughs and ""oh my fucking gods"" continued my teacher who was sitting at his desk behind me got really pissed and shouted at everyone to shut up, threatening to kick out anyone who made a peep. Still confused as hell as to what was happening I noticed my classmate's faces turning bright red trying to suppress their laughter.


As soon as I started talking one boy burst out laughing which set everyone off again. This time the teacher got more pissed off than I had ever seen him and he ended up storming out of the class telling us that he's not going to bother teaching us if we can't learn to behave.


He then slammed the door behind him leaving me standing at the top of the class with my penis unknowingly exposed not knowing what to fucking do. I then heard one guy shout ""You've got a lovely willy Paul""


I looked down and saw my soft flaccid penis poking through the hole of my boxer shorts and out through my unzipped fly. The moment of realisation hit me like a ton of bricks and I thought I was going to pass out. I hurriedly put my penis back into my pants and everyone started jeering and clapping.


It really felt like I was in a nightmare and I am extremely overwhelmed and embarrassed by everything. I immediately ran out of the class and locked myself into a toilet cubicle. As soon as the coast was clear I ran home and haven't been to school since. 

TL;DR Doing a presentation in class - penis unknowingly exposed - social life ruined


[Edit] Thanks everyone for your kind and helpful words. My Facebook is full of comments from my friends who are worried about me not showing up to school. They are also advising me just to man up and laugh it off. The free willy t-shirt idea is definitely something I'll consider too lol. I'm going go back to school on Monday mainly because the teacher is aware of what happened and Im worried he's going to ring my mom and tell her everything."
3zjvrj,non_TBI,"This happened like two days ago, and I'm still not able to shake it off. 
I will try to keep this short, but no promises. 
Background first; I am a Pakistani teen (18) living in Saudi Arabia. Now, it's not well known but Saudi Arabians are way more conservative than Pakistanis, they're ridiculously possessive about their wives, and have segregation of males and females at events like weddings and parties etc. My dad works here as an engineer, and has befriended hell a lot of Arabs, while I am comparatively newer to the country and don't know much about the culture.
So, on Sunday my dad tells me about this dinner we've to attend on his Saudi friend's place, let's call him 'Ahmed'. Now, I've seen Ahmed quite a few times, and I know that he has a little daughter, probably 3 year old named Ayesha, and son about 4 named Ali. 
So fast forward to dinner. I'm sitting along my dad's colleagues all exclusively Arabs, they're all speaking Arabic probably talking about work, while I am busy eating. Also wondering where the little kids at. When suddenly Ahmed in broken English ask me am I getting bored, to which I reply ""No, it's great to meet you guys, where's Ayesha though? Isn't she the cutest"". Right after I said this, literally everyone looks at me, and they all stop chewing. Ahmed starts shouting at my dad in arabic and I can tell he's way too upset. He stands up and asks us to leave. I am thinking what the hell? Turns out Ayesha is his wife's name not his daughter, Daughter's name was Alisha. 
Ahmed is still pissed at us, and thinks I'm some sort of uncultured pervert, who's after his wife. 

TL;DR Confused names of wife and a kid in a conservative family, got kicked out."
27azii,non_TBI,"I am still on his account and going to subscribe to every gay porn subreddit I can find. Sorry kiddo, love you"
3du3sv,non_TBI,"So last night I was in bed waiting for my wife to finish her before bed rituals when my 8 year old daughter comes in for a good night hug and kiss. We get to talking and I use the line ""girls rule and boys drool"" cause she's at that age where the boys at school think otherwise. 
The part where I messed up was at that exact moment I catch the eye of my 4 year old son who was also in the room, and the look of pure defeat on his face was so depressing and his poor little soul crushed I thought maybe I scared him for life. In an attempt to bring back his manhood I had to tell him Girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider and boys go to mars to get more candy bars. He likes candy, so he probably won't be scarred for life. "
32wqnn,non_TBI,"This wasn't today but I'm still living the consequences. 

A few days ago, my girlfriend came over to my house and things got heated, as they do. 

I decided to go down on her, which I love to do and will put 110% effort into because I enjoy it. Funnily enough, she was enjoying it too and we were in a position in which she was sat on my face, facing me whilst i licked her out and she rocked back and forth. 


What neither of us realised was that, because she'd shaved a couple of days ago, she had a mass of sharp stubble that was protruding from her pubic mound. And every time she rocked forward and backward whilst applying a lot of pressure on me, this was brushing against my face. 


Now I'm not gonna say it didn't hurt in the moment, because it did, but when you're caught up in sexytimes there's little you want to worry about except getting your partner off so I kept going and this went on for maybe 10 or 15 minutes. I just ignored the pain because I was keen to let her enjoy herself and knew. I could deal with it. 


When I finally took my tongue out of the ham cabinet, what became very apparent was the burning pain all over my lower face. We turned the lights on and the bottom portion of my face, from my nose down, was as red as a tomato, like it had been painted with the blood of my enemies. 


Suddenly, clarity of the situation came flooding in, in the activities partaken in, I had given myself a severe friction burn that was both ridiculously painful, and inexplainable to anyone with a reasonable explanation! I mean how the fuck do you explain that?
I felt like not leaving the house until it had healed but I still had my parents to make an excuse to, and college and other commitments. 


It was funny for her, and she was laughing hysterically with intermittent sympathy, but I was legitimately worried about how I was going to explain this without utter embarrassment. In the end I did the only thing I know, the rightful British thing to do... I told everyone that I had spilled hot tea on my face, my parents wanted to take me to a doctor just to check it out and make sure it wasn't going to scar but I wouldn't let them otherwise they'd realise it was a friction burn and not a liquid based splashy burn. 


This is 3 days later and it's worse now, skin slightly peeling and redness is just as bad as it was. Hopefully it goes away within a week, that seems to be the general consensus regarding first degree burns from my research. Luckily no one has questioned my excuse. 


**TL;DR: Carpet munch, carpet burn, God save the Queen.**


Edit: Not sure the comment I posted it in is ever gonna surface, so I'll chuck on an edit. This is a photo immediately after we realised what had happened, it got more red and peely and painful, but I'm not in a good position to take a new picture atm. Enjoy...

3xhhw5,non_TBI,"To begin, this didn't happen today, or a few months ago. I was in the fourth grade circa 1995ish. 

I've never spoken about this since it happened but out there somewhere, there are around 30, former 4th grade students who if asked can recall the horror on my face. It all began over the summer of 1995. We had taken a family trip to Mammoth Caves in Kentucky.  We had a great time touring the caves. My dad had taken with us a camcorder he had recently purchased, and video taped many of the tours we went on. Fast forward the summer and onto the school year. 

We were studying science at the time. Different types of rocks, and how they were formed if I recall correctly. The teacher told us that we were to have a show and tell of the different types of rocks that we were able to find around our neighborhood. Naturally I recalled all of the awesome rock formations I had seen at Mammoth Caves, and asked if I could bring the video instead. Excited to see some of the footage my teacher agreed. 

I went home and asked my mom and dad if I could share one of the tapes. They said I could and asked if I knew where they were. I said that I did. Wellllllll aparently the tapes that were stored in their dresser drawer weren't footage of our family vacation. Now, let me backtrack a little before I get to the nitty gritty. I'd like to add that I was a very curious kid. I would sneak into anywhere I could just to explore and see things. My parents' room was one of the locations I would sneak into. Thats how I knew that there were some camcorder tapes in their dresser. 

Moving along, I grabbed one of the camcorder tapes from the dresser. It was marked #3. I think that I figured that it was labeled that way because my dad took several videos on the trip, and I had never really seen him use the camcorder for anything else. Being a 4th grader I had no idea that my parents would have used it to record *that*. So myself, with video in my backpack went to school skipping happily, not knowing the horror that was to come. 

Show and tell day was finally here. I couldn't wait to knock the socks off of everyone with my videos of stalagmites and stalactites, and cave rooms filled with glittering quartz. At last my turn was next! My teacher rolled the tv and vcr to the front of the room and announced that ""You are all in for a verrry special treat!"" Little did we all know that ""treat"" was in fact going to be ""special"". 

She popped the video into the vcr and pressed play. I immediately recognized the room on the screen. ""Huh, thats odd"" I thought to myself. Then in the corner of the screen appears my mom. Luckily with all her bathing suit areas covered by lingerie. Then dad.....ohhh god. Hes in a speedo. Right then my teacher noticed what was happening and raced to the tv to shut it off before the class witnessed anything rated ""R"". 10 seconds of footage that seemed to last an eternity we're now burned into my memory along with the uproarious laughter of 30, 10 year old kids. 

My teacher grabbed the tape and called me to the hallway. I was in tears. Mortified. She asked me what the hell? I told her I had no idea that *that* was on the tape. She believed me and took the tape to the principal who called my parents. They told them that they had to go and pick up the tape and made me return to class. Stepping back into the classroom was the single most embarassing thing that has ever happened to me. And I'm 30 now. My parents never spoke of it. I'm sure they figured the embarassment was punushment enough. They never came to get the tape. 

I was ridiculed for weeks. Eventually people forgot and life returned to normal. Hopefully you werent expecting to read that my whole class watched as my dad had explicit relations with my mom. Not so sure I'd be sharing if that were the case. 

TL;DR Took family vacation to Mammoth Caves, dad took videos. I then took what I thought were those videos to class for show and tell.....turned out to be parent porn."
2oh6ui,non_TBI,"This happened last night, but I'm still laughing at it, so I thought you guys might enjoy it.
About 6 months ago, my girlfriend took a kitten in that we had seen wandering around the apartment complex for several weeks. The cat has been attached to her hip ever since, and walks around meowing whenever she's not here.
Keep in mind that my apartment walls are very thin.
So last night, I come home from work as my girlfriend is leaving for her shift. I take the dog out for a walk, feed both pets, open the back door because it's extremely nice outside, make myself dinner, then turn on the Xbox to play some Halo. As I sit down, the cat starts meowing louder than normal, so I pick her up and put her on my lap and start petting her to try to calm her down, which usually works, but she just keeps getting louder and eventually jumps off my lap to roam around the apartment and continue bitching.
She does this for a solid 30 minutes before I yell ""Bitch, I will cut you!"".
A few minutes later, I decide I'm gross from work and need a shower. So as I'm showering, the cat pushes the door open, hops up on the toilet seat and continues her fit. I peek my head out of the curtain and yell ""Shut up! I will fucking throw you away!"" (Before people complain, I wouldn't actually do that, I love the cat, she was just getting on my nerves). She continues her bitch-fit after my shower, while I clean up around the apartment  and yell idle threats at the feline.
I finish up cleaning, and sit back down to play some Halo with my cousin online. 5 minutes after doing so, there's a stern knock at the door, followed by the words ""Phoenix Police, open up."" My heart speeds up a little bit as all I can think is ""Why the hell are the cops here?"" So I answer the door to see two officers, while I stand there like a deer in the headlights, Xbox controller in hand, headset still on. ""We got a report of a possible domestic dispute in this apartment, mind if we come in?"" I'm standing there with an idiotic and confused look on my face ""Uh, you sure you're in the right place? I'm the only one here.""
""The complaint said [my apartment number], we need to come in and make sure everyone's ok.""
""Yeah, sure, come on in."" I put my controller and headset down and waited as they did their thing.
After going through my small place, and obviously not finding anyone, they asked if anyone else had been here at all, to which I told them it had just been me all night. ""The report we received mentioned people hearing threats of you 'cutting someone and throwing them away'"".
I immediately relaxed and started laughing to myself once they said that. I told them I had (not seriously) yelled that at the cat (who was still meowing the entire time they were there) because she wouldn't be quiet. They laughed a bit, decided that I in fact hadn't actually cut, beaten, or thrown anyone away, told me to keep it down next time, and went on their way.
I sat back down and put my headset back on and hear my cousin laughing his ass off saying "" Did that really just happen?!""
""Yeah. Yeah it did.""


TL;DR - Don't yell at the pussy. The cops will come


EDIT: Apparently this made front page! Thanks guys (and annoying cat)! Glad you enjoyed the shenanigans

31jzcf,non_TBI,"So I was at a popular mexican resturant named Cheekys and while I was there with some friends the conversation starting to get pretty stale since we had been there for about an hour or so. To get to the point, I decided to hop on tinder and look for some potential mates.

After a few minutes of swiping left and right I saw a questionable swipe and handed it over to one of my friends. Who immediately started to laugh and handed the phone back to me and said she was extremely ugly (She wasn't, he is just a douche). So im coming to an agreeance with his opinion I swiped left. Simple as that right? No.

Upon looking up, we see our waitress standing over us staring directly at my phone. It was then that we realized she was the exact same girl on tinder. I could see the pain in her eyes as she dropped the checks onto our table and went to the back of the resturant to presumably cry her eyes out. We didn't see her for the rest of the night and the manager came over to apologize to us that our waitress was feeling ill and couldn't finish helping us.

Feeling like total shitbags we managed to pool together $67.20 in tips to give her. Left a little note on the bottom that said ""Hey, we are just dicks. You're actually really pretty :)"" and left.

So yeah, today I fucked up by swiping left."
2kipg7,non_TBI,"This TIFU happened many many years ago, however is definitely one of my favourite stories. 

I was out with my family, bundled against the cold in my winter jacket, when I found a piece of coal on the ground. I was incredibly excited, because as we all know (and I had probably just recently learned), coal turns into diamonds. Now, I knew to turn this coal into a diamond it had to be in a warm place, and in the dead of winter what better place to keep something warm than in my toasty winter coat pocket? 

Rather than share the news of our new found fortune with my parents I decided I wanted to be able to surprise them with my genius when I eventually procured a diamond from my pocket. However, as I had many other important child things on my mind, I soon forgot about the coal, spring came around, and winter clothing got put away for the warm weather. 


Fast forward to the next winter and I am standing in the foyer with my Dad while he pulls out my winter coat and starts checking the pockets. Suddenly I remember the coal that has slowly been turning into a diamond over the past year and I am so fucking excited. My Dad is going to find a diamond in my pocket, and he is going to be so happy with me.


I can barely contain myself, watching intensely as he pulls the object out of my winter pocket, and turns me with a look of utter disbelief on his face and goes, “Happysaurous, why do you have a piece of dried dog shit in your pocket?”
"
2glgsu,non_TBI,"Do I get bonus points for this happening today? Little back story, I hate my job with a passion. I excelled very far in a certain field and got all other roles takes away from me to focus on this mind numbing process that I can apparently break records in. 

I have a semi-private office, and can get away with playing on my phone most days, if certain people aren't in that day I can get away with Netflix. But the safe option has always been just playing around on my phone, since my data allowance starting taking a real chomp when I found a new way to speed up my working routine, I decided to switch to my old Pokemon games, Fire Red for those that must know. 

So over the last two weeks, I've managed to train myself up a good little team, decided that I wouldn't use any legendaries or cheat codes to get certain Pokemon. Leaving the only real challenge for the most part was catching a Dratini in the safari zone. I hadn't played a new pokemon game since Silver/Gold/Crystal. And Fire Red was a recent purchase to relive old glories. So trying to remember the weaknesses / evolutions / everything else to be the best, like no one ever was. It actually turned out to be quite challenging, and really enjoyable. 

Until the Elite Four, I was fucking up pretty much all day Monday, maybe two or three hours worth of playing and I'd fall at either Lance or the Ghost woman. Simple mistakes or risks that I shouldn't take, I had a splitting headache so I wasn't concentrating that much anyway. I gave up, turned my phone off and went back to work, for once. Then comes today. 

I'm through to Lance, all 6 pokemon still going an healthy, I'm halfway through the battle, he's already lost three of his Pokemon, and I get a call from the other office telling me there's a conference on line 1. 

This is an important phone call, there's our manager, his manager, the area manager, regional manager, regional director and that guys boss, I don't even know what that guys title is but he probably made what I make in a year just listening to the next five minutes of awkwardness. 

I defeat Lance during the opening the conference, I lost two Pokemon, no revives left, a few max potions, so I restore my four remaining Pokemon and head off to face Green. I'm not involved during this part of the conversation on the phone, so I focus on my battle, it's tense, it's down to one on one, my Riachu hits a Thunder on Blastoise and I win! Forgetting where I am I shout ""fuck yeah!"" ...

Silence. And then... silence is broken...

""WHO THE FUCK SAID THAT? I WILL FIND OUT WHO SAID THAT AND I WILL MAKE SURE I COME DOWN THERE AND FIRE YOU PERSONALLY. GOD HELP WHOEVER THAT WAS.""

End of phone call. I hang up, pretend not to know anything and go ask my manager in the other office what just happened, explaining that I wasn't listening to that part of the conversation since my part wasn't for another ten minutes in the briefings. The explanation is horrifying. This is pretty much a quote from what he said:

""It was insane, [Boss Man's Name] was talking about charity work and the collections in each of our stores, he said something like 'this is a charity that I set up in memorial for my daughter, who died last year.' and someone yelled fuck yeah. Whoever that is, is screwed. Just keep quiet the rest of the day and try to keep all queries in this office, give him time to find out who that was.""

So that's where I am now... probably gonna get fired. At least I hated this job, right?

UPDATE: holy shit my inbox exploded, and front page, kind of awesome. For those wanting an update, I posted this about 11pm over here so I'll give a proper update tomortow when I'm back in and find out whats going on. The conference got rescheduled so hopefully I won't do the same thing again.

Also no, my phone did not have a mute function. Mute functions cost money.

UPDATE 2: Okay so most important question out the way first: my team was Charizard, Dragonite, Riachu, Pidgeot, Marowak(with that club that increases its attack) and Poliwrath.

Question 2: My phone really didnt have a mute.

Question 3: Yes in 2014, this phone did not have a mute. The other phones don't have a loudspeaker.

In all seriousness, in the mix of people wishing I'd get fired, calling bullshit or just crying about something else, some people asked for an actual update. I walked into work this morning and the big boss guy (who, as someone suggested) shall henceforth be known as Giovanni, has scheduled a new meeting and blamed ""unfortunate timing and inappropriate actions on both ends"" and the matter is pretty much over with.

Seems like all will be okay, I've decided to chat with my boss about incorporating new roles into my job and looks like I'll have some more things to do around the office. Yay.

I'll try to respond to replies on my lunch break, the nicer ones anyway, today this office shall stay Pokemon free. Although I've heard good things about Ruby..."
3fvuai,non_TBI,"**TL;DR Used Waze to report a speed trap, got ""harassed"" by a cop that spotted my vehilcle**

Well, this just happened minutes ago. I had to go get an MRI this morning, and on the way there I pass a speed trap on the other side of the highway. I see this trap every morning and I always use Waze on my drives, so I plug in a map chat to warn people. I've done this on other days and figured I'll just do it again.

I arrive at the MRI facility and I get a notification from Waze that someone thanked me for the note. After the MRI, I take the same way home and pass the speed trap again. The speed limit is 55 in that area and I'm only going about 52, so I'm good, right? Nope...two motorcycle cops come rolling up behind me and pull me over.

I turn off my Jeep and roll the window down and wait. One of them approaches and I say hello. He asks me for my license and says ""it's not nice to tattle on people"". I say ""Sorry, I don't follow"" and he says ""oh, you didn't get my note on waze? "" I then realize that he was the one that thanked me for the warning. He used the app and saw me coming on the way back. Then he asks how long I've been in town and I tell him I moved here about 3 months ago.  He starts to tell me that I have to register my vehicle in state after 10 days and then asks why my drivers license (from FL) has a Texas address on it, and that it must be bad.  I explain that in military and exempt from having to register my vehicle here and that is the same reason why my license had a Texas address... Renewing while out of state. He walks back to his bike and calls it in. 

He finally walked back up and hands me back my license and says ""stop reporting our speed trap, we can make your morning commute a lot more difficult every morning. Have a nice day""

Edit/Update thingey:  Damn, didn't expect a full inbox after work.    I don't view this as harassment, people.  I drive a rather recognizable vehicle and was the only one in that lane for a good distance and slowed down as I passed them (habit from Florida and the ""Move over/slow down law"")  I got a good distance passed them when they rolled up.  So for those calling BS on the Waze constant tracking, I could have been on his map by then, who knows.

   I've been pulled over before for my out of state tags, and considering I only have a rear tag, some cops have zeroed in on me in the 2 tag states.  When he walked up, he wasn't condescending (that means you talk down to people) or rude.  It just seemed like he was blowing off a little steam.  After he figured out the whole military out of state thing, and the DL address thing, he made a quick stab and let me go.  I'm only going to say it was Denver PD... no reason to drag this shit out and bring in the Supreme Court.

  For those who don't understand Waze and the map chat thing...it shows the chat bubble on the map and when you click on it, it shows who posted it.  For all I know, the cop could have been stopping me for something else and then realized I was the one who posted that...I don't care.  I just thought this FU was different because of the circumstances.

  And for those calling BS on my plate being my Waze username... Its a vanity plate, not a standard issue one.

  Oh, and thanks for the gold, Officer."
3ozro8,non_TBI,"Long time lurker, first time poster. This happened awhile back, but it's a pretty perfect story for TIFU.

A few years a go, I had just finished going through a bad breakup with this sociopath of a girl. Essentially, I went home from college for my Dad's birthday and she decides to tell me that she ""had to sleep"" with someone else. The reason was that I ""wasn't there to satisfy her"" for the 3 days in which I was away from my university town.

Anyway, she called me while I was at home to tell me the news and I was devastated. My mum, being the strange woman that she is, decides that she's going to invite me to an amateur fashion show so that hopefully I'll meet a nice girl (to eventually marry and have beautiful children with - I know). Bizarrely, I run into this girl called Sara who seems into me. We arrange a date for the next day and I thank my mum for the invitation.

Side note: my mother has caught some virus and feels ill.

Continuing the story:

I go out with Sara - and I am just on full form. I'm charming witty and I'm pretty quickly forgetting about the Ex-GF. So now we've had about 8 drinks each and Sara is a crass girl -- and I'm pretty forthcoming too. It gets to the point where she gives me this sultry look, and I just say ""let's just get out of here and fuck"". Not my best line, but she agrees. I mean, we're both pretty slaughtered by this point. It's 2 a.m, and we're stumbling down the street. She even falls over she’s so drunk. After making sure she’s okay we walk to the taxi rank.

I ask if we can go to hers, and she demands that we go to mine - something about a stalker-ish roommate? (Forgive me on details - this was a long time a go.) I'm now in this awkward situation where I want to take this girl back to my parent's place, but I know they would not be cool with this. I decide fuck it - and we get a taxi back to my place. 

Anyway, we sneak in, my parents are asleep and we quickly get to work. Now, I don’t mean to be rude, but this girl MOANS. But not like a sexy moan, I mean a kind of sleepy / slightly in pain moan. After making sure that she was still into it (she was), I continue.

This is where things get bad. 

I hear a knock on my door. It’s my mum, “James? James? Is that you? Are you ill?”. I respond in a strained voice “Yeah mum, I’m fine, I was a bit ill but I’m feeling okay now”. My mum says something and buggers off. 

So I’m going at Sara in missionary and she won’t shut up. Here’s where it gets really bad. There’s this pillow next to her face, and I kinda *gently* put this pillow over her face a bit. Y’know - to muffle the noise? (I did check with her the next day - apparently she was okay with this.) Anyway, this seems to help. Her moans are now quieter and I think I’m in the clear. 

…Or so I thought. My mum now just barges into my room *convinced* that I’m ill. She’s carrying cough syrup, painkillers, a sick bowl and all sorts. Then she sees me pounding away at this girl with a pillow over the head and a guilty look on my face. This is not the climax of the story. Anyway, after an awkward 10 second silence. She leaves, and Sara and I go to sleep. Sara then leaves at 5am. I’m now just praying to god that we’re English enough such that this will never get brought up out of awkwardness.

My mum looks at me with disgust over breakfast. Stony silence. After some small talk, she decides that she needs to do the washing. She then says that I will need to “wash my sheets”. I take the hint and bring down the semen stained duvet. Except, my duvet isn’t white. It’s red. It turns out, when Sara fell down on the way to the taxi rank, she cut open her leg. 

There was then a lot of discussion. Long story short: My mum thinks I have a fetish for shagging girls on their period and strangling them.

TL;DR. My mum thinks I'm into some strange fetishes.
"
2i6nli,non_TBI,"In 7th grade, like many other pubescent girls, I went through a bit of a ""Hot Topic"" phase. Lots of rubber black bracelets, leather chokers, pants with suspenders...you get the idea.

One night, as my family was getting ready to go to dinner my dad asked my to get some quarters from his night stand to feed the parking meter in front of the restaurant. I went into his night stand, grabbed some quarters and noticed this really awesome bracelet.

It was black leather, with studs and a series of clasps so you could adjust the bracelet to fit your wrist. I didn't remember buying this particular bracelet but I figured it was mine and I probably misplaced it and it ended up in my dad's night stand junk drawer.

We're halfway through dinner when my dad notices my wrist and literally spits his food out on the table and angrily asks me, ""where did you get that bracelet?"" I told him where I found it and he said, ""you need to put that back as soon we we get home.""

I put it back and didn't think about it again until years later when I stumbled upon a porn site where a male actor was wearing a familiar looking leather bracelet around his penis.

A feeling of hot, sweaty dread filled my veins as I had a flashback to that moment years before at the dinner table when my dad got angry at me for borrowing his special bracelet. I realized that I gone out to a family dinner while wearing my father's leather cock ring. And that's probably the reason that I work in the adult industry today*.
*behind the scenes



Edit: a lot of people have asked me how big my wrist is. It's normal size. Not giant penis size. I just made a little video a couple of days ago and if you'd like, you can see it here and check out my wrist: **http://youtu.be/4o5syH7Xv78**"

I start to sweat profusely, and proceed to make it worse. ""Just to clarify, I wore pants when playing with the children. I always had pants on."" Interviewers continue to stare deadpan.

33ps2k,non_TBI,"This actually happened today, so i guess i get bonus TIFU points!

 Well, for some background first: I'm a 17 year old guy, currently in high school. Iv'e had a girlfriend for almost 2 months and today we decided to go ahead and have some fun. I'm a virgin, she's not. Had, a condom , felt pretty relaxed about the whole situation, all that jazz. Overall, i thought stuff was gonna go okay.

 Alright, so i go to her place, we get in bed, start making out, i get a hard-on from the start of it. Stuff was going pretty well, but slow as fuck. It took me like 30 minutes to see her bra. Fast forward a little, after about one hour and 30 minutes im only in my boxers, she's in her panties.

 After having my dick up for almost 2 hours, my heart sinks when i notice i went soft, at this exact time she wants to get to fucking. I try to play it cool, go on with some more foreplay, try to stealthily rub it, but it's dead. It's fucking dead, it feels *numb* by now, im barely even feeling it when she goes for a grab! I try to go call for a bathroom break, i take a piss, try to mess around with it a bit more, but still nothing.

 I go back to her room, and there she is, with a ripped condom wrapper in her mouth. Good luck playing pool with this rope sweetheart! Before  i can even say anything she pulls down my boxers, and boom, no boner, only tiny bald mole in here. She tries to grab it, suck it, whatever man, i don't even feel her down there anymore.

 Seeing as i won't get anything done, i try to cut my losses and go for some fingering. I get pretty turned on by moans, so by some sort of miracle i get back up. She notices and goes in for a blowjob. At this point i should mention iv'e been standing around naked for almost an hour and its pretty cold in here. I realize im actually shivering. I start shivering even harder to the point where im basically having a seizure, dick still in her mouth. During my little seizure i manage to lose it again. With my cock *inside her goddamn throat*. I don't even wanna know what it's like to deepthroat a guy and feel his dick retracting...

  I decide go back in for some more fingering, this time stuff gets pretty heated, i actually raise the fallen soldier again, and as i take my hand out to grab the condom before its too late... Period blood. Motherfucking period blood on my fingers. She notices, and just kinda starts sobbing , and just ran away to the bathroom, locked the door behind her.  

 ""Well, no fuck"" is all i could mumble as i stood there, butt naked with period blood on my hand and my girlfriend crying in the bathroom.

**TL;DR**: Got to have sex with girlfriend, too much foreplay leads to dick getting tired.


 **Edit**: Apparently my gf browses reddit every now and then. That seems like a pretty bad thing right now, but it makes this whole thing even funnier.

**Second edit**: This shit blew up. I don't know which one of you crazy motherfuckers glided me, but damn i feel like i just got a medal for not getting it up. And it's awesome! "
2v1ioe,non_TBI,"So for the last two years my wife and I have lived in a house just outside of Kansas City. It's a quiet neighborhood. Very Midwestern.

Anyway, I'm a smoker and usually stay up later than my wife - sometimes deep into the night. I always step onto our back deck to light up, and for the duration of my cigarette I typically stare off into the fairly dense forest behind our house. Sometimes I'll see a deer or something, but that's usually it. 

Then about a week ago I started noticing something else: a dim light very deep in the woods. It would flicker occasionally like a fire or a candle. Over the next few days I continued to see it and stood on my porch pondering what it could be. Oddly it wouldn't appear before midnight, and often not until around 2 or 3 in the morning. 
I Google Earth-ed my house to see if there were any other houses on the other side of the woods. There weren't; we're basically on the edge of town. 

Other strange things started happening around the same time of night: sudden influxes of traffic (odd for a small suburb at 3AM), car doors slamming, inexplicable noises.

Eventually I decided I would go to investigate, but figured I would go during the day because - let's be honest - I read too much /r/creepy at night and my brain was filled with the horrifying scenarios that could be awaiting me out there. So I go during daylight hours, not even sure what I am looking for. We've recently gotten a good bit of snow in KC, so the first strange thing I find is human footprints. There were only a few at first, but as I followed them they grew in number until the snow was so trampled the dirt was visible. I also saw some sort of fire pit, liquor bottles and a dirty old coat.

I returned to the house and told my wife. In our relationship I'm definitely the more laid back one, and I assumed it was a bunch of high school kids who went off to get drunk in the woods. After all, the occurrences were much more frequent on weekends. But in her Type-A mind, she would have none of it. 

So the next night she stays up with me. Sure enough around 2AM, things start to pick up again and that light appears - even brighter than usual. She calls the cops. 

Two officers arrive. I explain what's been going on and show them the light. They go off through my backyard and into the woods while my wife and I wait on the deck and watch.
The whole time I'm thinking ""these poor kids are probably drunk or stoned or both...and *I'm* going to be the guy that breaks up the fun."" When did I become *that guy*?

But I didn't have much time to think about my advancing years, oh no. Because suddenly - deep in the woods - two blazing police flashlights light up the woods and our mouths dropped. 
Silhouetted around trees and bushes are the shadows of *at least* 30 very frantic people, darting off in every direction. There is shouting and howling and even raucous laughter as the police give chase. It's about this time we realize some of the shadows are running toward us. Then about half of the group bursts out of the woods and I finally know what we're dealing with:

It's a bunch of naked dudes.

And they ran right through my yard and into the street, some carrying bags and others carrying massive erections. One of them shouted ""Hey there!"" to us as they ran by, naked as can be, and into the street. My wife is horrified. I on the other hand, have fallen in the snow from laughter.

The next day the police come back and question me. Turns out they only got one of the guys. AND HE SAYS I WAS HOSTING THEM! He doesn't know my name but he pointed to our house as the ""meetup point."" Turns out my house has been the beacon for several gay orgies over the years. The cops question me some more before they find me innocent or whatever. Then they advise me to clean up my yard. So I go out there and what do I find? Condoms and dildos and strap-ons galore, just dumped out of panic in my yard.

Needless to say the next trash day was an interesting one. 

TL;DR: investigated a small light in my woods, accidentally broke up a massive gay orgy.

EDIT: The cops let me take a picture of their evidence bag: http://imgur.com/zJjQhKb
Notice the single dildo and asshole shaped fleshlight...the cops left the rest of them in my yard.

EDIT 2: Glad I could wake up to see this on the front page! For those KC residents who are curious, I'm in Stilwell, KS, which is near Overland Park.

The million-dollar question seem to be, ""why would a gay orgy need strap-ons?"" Although I can only speculate, I assume the cold air had led to...performance issues.

32n6x5,non_TBI,"So this happened about ten years ago. My father owns a pretty large heavy construction company and every so often we are tasked with demolishing houses. My father won a public bid to demolish a few homes in a public; low income housing complex that were condemned by the city for disrepair. My dad goes to Florida in the winter and I become the superintendent of our sites for a few months. The day before he leaves he gives me the paperwork for this job. It's in a rough neighborhood. And by rough I mean Berlin post WWII rough. Oh well, seems like an easy enough job. Two house demos in three days.

The following day I load our machine on the lowboy, a PC-220 Komatsu excavator with a grapple, and drive over to the neighborhood. I call the recycling company before I get there to make sure they'll have enough demolition trailers for the debris from both houses. Everything looks good and I tell my guys to meet me at the houses.

Once I arrive in the neighborhood I realize that the only thing I have to go by is the description of the homes on the contract because there are no house numbers and a community mailbox. I pull up to a ""blue three story dwelling circumvented by a wooden porch"" just like it says on my contract.

It's important to know that for all other demos we usually go into the homes and take out all the copper for recycling. This contract stated that the housing authority has already recycled everything so there was no reason to enter the home. We only have three days so I get to work unloading the machine.

Once we are all set up its around 8am. People are bustling in the neighborhood; getting up and going to work for the day. I start by taking off the roof, load by load, everything is going smoothly. I load up the first truck with the debris until it is filled. The truck leaves and an empty one pulls up to replace it. I now start with the second floor. I see a dresser in my grapple. I think to myself ""oh well the previous tenants must have left some furniture"". Next the grapple has a bed in it. Then a pile of clothes. Then a tv. At this point something seems fishy so I get off the machine and walk up to the side window of the half demolished house. I look inside and my heart sinks. There are pictures on walls, a fridge, dining room table and a typical family living room. This is the wrong house. Someone obviously lives here. I run to my truck and grab my phone, but before I can even call my dad the housing authority representative pulls up and judging by the look on his face this was absolutely positively the wrong house. 

Long story short this home was also owned by the housing authority and the tenants were on vacation. We paid movers to take the remaining undamaged items from this half destroyed house to another (much nicer in my opinion). They set everything up as best as they could and we finished demolishing the house we had started. The worst part was no one had a mobile contact for the tenants. They arrived home a week later to the plot of land where their home once stood. In the end they got a sizable payout from the housing authority for not supervising the demo, which was stated in our contract. Dad didn't talk to me for months.

Edit:
Wow front page!
Thanks for my first gold kind stranger! 

A few updates to clear some things up:
-A couple in their early 70s lived in the house, rent was partially supplemented by the city. Yes, they were on vacation, and retired...
-I only damaged items from their guest bedroom and hallway, they walked away with 90% of their items
-Yes I do know that I could have killed someone, and I have paid for this mistake throughout my life.
-I met the couple about a month after the incident and they harbored no animosity. Really nice folks actually, ended up moving south after the settlement.
-I am still in construction today and have my OSHA 30 training, a lot more mature and careful now
-Anyone who doesn't believe my story can pound sand, I'll look for some proof that doesn't give away the location or my business when I get home

255b6l,non_TBI,"So today I decided to jack off in my bathroom before I took a shower. I lied down on my back on the floor(you should try it) and started fapping away. I hear a thud on the roof about halfway through my session and thought it was no big deal.

**WRONG**

I forgot that my house was getting re-roofed today. So as I am furiously stroking my sausage, looking up at the skylight directly above me, this heavy, sweaty mexican guy looks down at me. We locked eyes for about two seconds before he moved away from the skylight. I jumped up, got dressed, and hid in my room the rest of the day until they left. 


Edit: Was not expecting to make the top page. Thank you all for laughing at/with me. For everyone saying ""how do you forget your house is being re-roofed?"" its my parents house and they mentioned it a weeks or so earlier."
2ksafq,non_TBI,"Happened about an hour ago. Lunchtime, I'm walking the short distance from the separate building where I work to the main office where the cafeteria is. As I approach the doors from the side I spy a pretty girl I've never seen before approaching the same door from straight on.


The timing (and the fact that the door opens towards me) means I can do the gentlemanly thing and open the door for her and let her through first. I plan to bow and smile, cool. I reach the door and these doors are quite heavy so a little effort is needed to open them.


As I reach for the handle I turn my head to do the 'after you' smile. This is where I FU. By looking at the girl I miss the handle. But I’m already leaning back to counter the weight of the door and I fall over in the most uncool fashion imaginable.


By brain fails to react and I literally go down backwards like a felled tree. I hit my shoulder hard on the post which supports the canopy over the door. Had it been my head that I hit I would've been out cold.
I get up pretending to be fine, she seems concerned but is trying not to laugh. I'm trying not to cry. I am not cool."
3edqrq,non_TBI,"So this happened when I was 19 near my home town. I was at a house party when I met a girl and we proceeded to go back to her house. Well she was 18 and attending college later that year so she still lived with her parents. So we sneak in, go up stairs to her bedroom for some sexy time. I was there for maybe a couple of minutes when we hear the phone ring and her father come walking down the hall. She freaks out and tells me to get out on the roof (her room was on the second floor and they had an awning type roof covering their porch). I was drunk and was not in the best state of mind to make rash decisions. So I reluctantly go out the window and lay down on the roof.

This is where it gets fucked up. The father comes bursting in the room and tells her that her little sister was in a car accident and that they are leaving for the hospital right now. So she waits for her father to leave opens the window and tells me she will leave it unlocked and that I can leave after they leave. Night is just getting better and better. Well the mother comes in crying and starts helping her pack some things for her sister. She then notices the window is unlocked and locks it on her way out. I guess the girl didn't notice. 

So here I am around 1100 on a Friday night, its about 45 degrees outside and I am only in my boxers and socks. After they left I tried everything I could to open that window, no luck. There was no way I was jumping as it was the second story and they lived on a steep hill. So instead of 20 ft it would have been around 30 and a painful roll down. I had no phone and no other way of signaling anyone for help. Im not sure someone would help a half naked boy on the side of a house anyway.

So after about an hour of me losing feeling in my extremities and full of false hope that the girl would return any minute to open the window. I decided the only logical thing would be to break in. Surprisingly its not that hard to break a sliding window off its tracks and I managed to keep it from completely shattering all onto her floor. I grabbed my belongings and booked it out of there.
The following day I get a call from her apologizing to me about how she left me. Yes thats right, she apologized to me because I had to smash in her window. The sister ended up being fine and her father got the police involved for my little stunt but she is the only one that knows it was me. Never saw her or talked to her again after that.

TL;DR Met a girl, she was rad. Got on the roof to hide from her dad. Broke in and wasn't half bad. Never saw her again and I ain't even sad. 

Edit: Sorry for the paragraphs. As you can tell by most post history I have been mostly a lurker on this site for the past couple of years. Guess I should have posted this on my computer instead of my phone. I'm glad TIFU enjoyed my fuck up."

Here's my original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3cscze/tifu_by_accidentally_emailing_my_dad_a_video/

And here's what it said:

I was emailing with my dad about a road trip we're about to take together across Utah next month, and went to send him a link to a desert quad biking company. But instead of copying the url from the quad biking site I accidentally copied the url from a vimeo video I had open in another tab, which was of a very funny but very twisted short film about father/son incest. So yeah, now my dad thinks I want to suck his dick.

Here's the film I sent him by accident.

https://vimeo.com/130730908


And here's my UPDATE:

Well I met with my dad for dinner and to be honest things didn’t quite go according to plan. I immediately explained to him how I’d mistakenly sent him the link to the incest comedy rather than the quad bike company, and that my “we should do this” comment was about quad biking and NOT sucking each other’s dicks. He seemed to believe me and we laughed about it. So far so awkward. But then, drunk on the relief of how I’d managed to resolve the whole thing I went and made a fatal error. I told him about my reddit post, and about how I’d told half the internet about our little misunderstanding. I even showed him a bunch of all your comments on my phone. My dad did NOT like that I’d gone public with this. He did not like it ONE BIT. In fact, he got very fucking pissed and walked out the restaurant saying I was a stupid kid, a creep etc etc. I’m THIRTY FUCKING ONE, BY THE WAY. Anyway, I’m sure he’ll get over it, but right now I’d say my chances of getting a blowjob from him any time soon are virtually nil.


****UPDATE TO THE UPDATE****

A number of people asked me to post an additional update on the situation with my dad. So like before, here it is a fresh post (as requested).

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3cxb6a/update_to_the_update_tifu_by_accidentally/

"
3ngag8,non_TBI,"Just came to the end of the massive organic synthesis unit in A2 Chemistry (UK) and decided that the best way to keep all my notes together would be by stapling them so they'd stay in order. We're talking pretty bulky here, too many pieces of paper to use a normal stapler - too thick. A-ha! Lightbulb moment! Let's use a staple gun. More precisely, let's put all the pieces of paper down on the dining room table and staple them that way. 

Fast forward 5 seconds, and over a month's worth of organic chemistry notes are stapled to an antique wooden table, along with the tablecloth and my dignity. I've managed to prise them free with only moderate ripping, but I'm unable to free the tablecloth without damaging it, so I'm just leaving it in place until I think of a solution. I feel like such an idiot right now.

UPDATE: I got the staple out using a butter knife, with minimal damage to either table or cloth! Thanks for your, uh, support chaps"
2n3tyx,non_TBI,"I handcuffed her in the front. After we were done I threw her the key and went into the kitchen. I came back and she said she couldn't open them. I saw the key in the lock and just thought it was an awkward angle to turn for her since she was cuffed. 


Nope. 

I tried to turn the key and it was stuck, I tried to turn it more and the tooth broke off. 


SHIT. I don't have an extra key. 

Okay. Starting to worry now. I YouTube how to pick handcuffs.

I try for an hour using one of her Bobby pins. No success. 


Fuck. 

The next step was trying to drill out the key hole hoping the mechanism would fail. It didn't. 

Fuck. 

We're on the 3rd hour. I can't call the fire department, I'm a firefighter on the fire department!!



Que going to Walmart at 3AM and buying bolt cutters. I'm not leaving her alone cuffed and she can't put a shirt on, I spot a Scooby doo blanket and tie it around her. 


Surely these will work?

The cutting of the chain was easy. 

I tried to cut off one of the handcuffs and struggled for about 5 minutes before getting it cut off. 


Next!

Oh no. 

The bolt cutter blades seemed to have came out of alignment. Every time I would try to cut the handcuff it would twist, obviously hurting her. 

I tried cutting different spots to no avail, until I finally cut along the hinge where it finally separated.

3xf693,non_TBI,"I was sitting in my room talking with friends online when someone linked a photo that was one of the Ishihara colorblind tests. I could not see what was on it, and my friends were laughing hysterically at the joke that I couldn't see. They refused to tell me so I called my mother into the room to tell me what is was. Mind you, it was a fullscreen 1920x1080 photo that filled my entire monitor.


She promptly yelled ""WHY IS THERE A GIANT DICK ON YOUR SCREEN?"" and I was greeted by even more laughter from my friends and then my own mother laughed at me and walked out saying ""*You dumbass*"".

40y4wy,non_TBI,"So this actually happened about nine years ago, but TIFU by trying to chase a girl.

There was a new girl that worked at a store where I was a regular and I had a crush on her from the first day she started. I hit it off with her pretty well and would talk to her when I came in, along with the rest of the employees since we knew each other pretty well (small store). Once a month the employees would get together and go see a movie at the theater next to their work when they all got off. I wanted to be a part of their next outting since the new girl would be joining them as well. One of the employees, Steve, got off work so I started asking him about the outting, telling him that I wish I was a part of the group since they all know me pretty well, and I was also want to work there. I didn't want to flat out say I wanted to tag along for her, so he invited me along. Needless to say I was excited to be able to try to spend some time with her outside of work. We all went to the movies and I ended up sitting next to Steve and my good friend Matt, while the new girl was a few seats down and I never really got to talk to her, while Steve was acting kind of strange, which was slightly disheartnening. 

I went back to the store the next week and Matt tells me ""I didn't know you were into dudes.""

I gave him a puzzling look and said ""I'm not. I'm into the new girl that works here. What makes you think that?""

Matt starts laughing ""Did you know that Steve is gay?""

I unwittingly reply ""Didn't have a clue."" 
But my eyes began to widen as I started to realize the truth. Matt told me that Steve had asked me to the movies thinking it was a date and that my excitement had him thinking that I was of the same mindset, and everyone else thought that I was there on a date with him. Never lived that down

TL;DR Was chasing a girl, and unknowingly was asked out by a gay man, and unwittingly accepted thinking it was a hang out with friends.

Also, I did eventually get the girl ;)

Edit 1: Grammar, and why I didn't mention the girl to Steve

Edit 2: For those of you wondering about the girl, it is a far less interesting story sadly. We ended up together for about a year, and while we split up, we still remained friends for quite some time. I got her mainly through persistence and explaining that I was trying to be there that night for her. She cut off an engagement the day before her wedding, and I'm currently in a long term relationship getting ready to propose (to a girl)."
3v023x,non_TBI,"This happened to me maybe 9 years ago, it's one of my best/saddest stories. Also it wasn't a sweet 16 it was a quinseniera, which is the hispanic sweet 16 which happens at 15.

My dad drags me to a party in Queens NY,  that I do not want to go to, it was in a very crowded apartment, with very loud music and drunk hispanic people. 

These parties can be fun in hindsight but I was a broody 19 year old who did not want to waste a Friday night going to a lame Quincinera. For context, this isn't like a sweet 16 full of girls, it's full of older family in a cramped apartment with maybe 2 of the girls friends, and everyone is drunk.

Anyway, my master plan is to simply find a seat at the party, stare into space for 3-4 hours, and then leave. Upon arriving every single seat is full. I am so broody and complainey and just want to sit down. I decide to ""improvise"". I find a table and just lean my butt on it.

This table was covered by a table-cloth, I assumed it was a wooden table, BAD ASSUMPTION. 

It was a glass table.

The table shatters and I fall to the floor. Not only that, this table has the quinsiniera cake on it, untouched (no one has had a single bite), RUINED on the floor. Everyone turns to look at me in a perfect semi-circle and the music stops just like the movies. I'll remind you that all these people are perfect strangers to me, it was my dad's friends friend's daughter or something.

It is the most awkward moment of my life, I manage to make some kind awkward sorry face, the kind where you show your teeth and kind of frown.

No one says anything, no one knows how to react. Finally a younger guy thinks of the only appropriate thing to say ""Are you okay?"". I was about to say yes, when I feel a dripping on my leg. I realize I cut myself somehow. So I say, ""no, I think I cut my leg"".

My dad get's very nervous, because if the cut is deep enough it could be real trouble because of the femoral artery, (it wasn't that bad fyi).

He rushes me to the bathroom and tells me to pull my pants down then and there, and for whatever reason two other guys come with him, who are strangers.

I'm bent over with my bare ass out with my dad and these two men looking at my ass and the cut, they don't close the bathroom door because they are in such a rush and worried, so everyone crowds around the bathroom to look. It's so insane, I couldn't believe what was happening, I felt like it was like a scene from American Pie or something.

I'm something of a hypochondriac so I of course am convinced I'm dying as there is a steady drip of blood coming down my leg, in hindsight it wasn't that bad at all.

A kinda silver lining was that since I was convinced I was dying I requested an ambulance and kept feeling like I was going to faint. This is a silver lining because I got to immediately leave the party with my Dad to get into the ambulance. Which was so much better than having to apologize to everyone at the party and face what I did. I remember the Mom of the quinseniera girl crying about the table as I left the apartment.

Now since the glass pierced my leg near my ass they pulled my pants down exposing my ass in the ambulance, and rolled me into the hospital there, so I'm rolling through a crowded hospital with my ass out in the ER.

Now this was a crowded ER with real wounds like gunshot wounds etc. I waited for HOURS. I can't remember how many because it was so long ago, but I remember it was the morning when I left. I never got treated, i just couldn't wait any longer and just walked out with a limp and went home.

I still feel the injury during certain yoga poses. It was a terrible, awkward, hilarious experience. I feel really bad for that girl that I ruined her party! And that's how TIFU.

TL;DR I sat on a glass table at a quinseniera ruining a girls birthday party and went to the ER for a cut near my ass.

Edit: People are asking if I'm a guy, yes I'm a guy, and do yoga.
Also people keep asking why I didn't write Quinceañera in the title. Mostly because I assumed people wouldn't know what it was.

2ympsq,non_TBI,"Recently my wife and I got two kittens, Harvi and Moxxie. They have been rambunctious little twerps, and they love to run around climbing on things. Their new favorite thing is climbing up our pant legs and fighting on our laps.

Tonight was the breaking point. I couldn't take the kittens constantly clawing their way up and down while I was at the computer, so I finally declared ""That's it! You can't climb up my pant leg if I'm not wearing pants!"" With a flourish, I whipped off my pants and sat back down.

It was a glorious five minutes before Moxxie leapt into the air, sunk her sharp, little kitty claws into my skin, and then stopped to contemplate climbing up the rest of the way.

Distracted by the devil attached to my leg, I failed to notice Harvi running toward me in an attempt to get to Moxxie. As the poorer climber, Harvi has always gone for the easiest route. She went for the only cloth she saw... and promptly sunk her claws through my boxer briefs and into my scrotum.

My wife claims to be in as much pain as I am, due to laughing so hard.

[Here are the perps.](http://imgur.com/a/Cn28f#0)

TL;DR - My kitten's claws have touched my balls more recently than my wife.



EDIT: Apparently the picture is titled ""As a lonely college student living alone, I decided to adopt some roommates"". It appears that someone has taken my image and published it as their own roughly 30 minutes before this edit.

33fay7,non_TBI,"This happened at my local game/movie store. As I was browsing the inventory a guy needs to walk in front of me, and as I back up I feel myself bump into a freestanding display of movies behind me. Fearing it was about to fall, I instantly get the clever idea to do a fancy 180 to grab it before it tips. Mid-turn, with my hand a little below shoulder height, I place my palm directly on the breast of a completely unseen girl behind me. Very nervous and wanting to explain the innocence of the situation, I instantly say ""I was just trying to grab that rack"" without realizing the double meaning. She gives me the most curious smile. Slightly confused and completely  embarrassed I walk away; not realizing what I said until 10 minutes later driving away.

TL;DR - walked away from the smoothest move I've ever made without realizing it

EDIT - The 2 most popular responses I'm getting are 1. FAKE And 2. ""How hot are you/her?""

1. This story is 98% true; the only thing not true is that it didn't literally happen yesterday ; it was at a FYE store in the mall. No the rack didn't fall it just rocked back and forth for maybe 2 seconds.

2. I'm maybe 7 material on my best day; I remember her as an 8 but considering the situation 6 is entirely possible.

3. For the non English speakers ""rack"" is slang for breasts."
3a9xsj,non_TBI,"Today we were having a discussion about 9/11. Keep in mind this is Australia, where we don't really care that much.

One of my friends brought up the fact that her family friend died in 9/11.

Without thinking I said ""What were his last words? ALLAH ACKBAR!!""

I imidiately stop and think ""wtf did I just say???""

It came from a joke I heard:  
> My dad died in 9/11, but at least I'll know his last words. **ALLAH ACKBAR**

Anyway, it was followed but 2 people laughing their asses off. 3 people going ""Ohhhhhhh [as in, dude wtf?]"". And her ignoring me indefinitely.

**EDIT:** I just want to clear up something. I said ""Australians don't care that much"" not ""Australian's are glad 9/11 happened and are planning another one."" Calm down."
3aw3ta,non_TBI,"My boyfriend and I have been dating since high school. When we went to prom together three years ago, I asked him what color dress I should wear, and he disgustingly told me, ""anything but purple."" The last three years, I have been avoiding wearing purple, buying purple, decorating with purple, etc. because I thought he hated the color purple. 

Today, I told him I found a shirt that I liked but I didn't get it because it was purple. He was extremely confused, so I explained to him why I have been pretty much avoiding purple for years. He laughed, and told me he doesn't remember saying that and that he was probably just messing with me. So much wasted time and energy trying to keep purple out of his life so he wouldn't have to look at what I thought he believed to be a disgusting color.

Edit: Everyone is taking this post way too damn seriously. I thought my boyfriend didn't like a certain color, so I didn't fill our lives with that color, it's not like I put myself into some extreme hardship or something to think about what he likes, too. It is possible to take into consideration what other people like while still having respect for yourself. Damn."
2q3j2z,non_TBI,"So this FU just happened about 20 minutes ago. I'm 21 (M) and i've known this girl (20) for about 5 years now, and we've been pretty good friends since then. We've never had a romantic history, as we've always just seen one another as friends, but admittedly, she's gorgeous. 5'10"", blonde hair, model type, really.

So about 20 minutes ago, I get a snap from her, and I opened it right away. To my delight and shock, it was a full-blown, balls-to-the-wall shot of her bent right over, on her knees, mirror selfie. Hands down, one of the most perfectly shaped backsides I've ever seen. Thinking quickly, and coming to terms with the finite time I had to gaze upon this smooth, magnificent anatomical work of art, I find it wise to take a screen shot. Mistake. Mind you, this happened within about 2 seconds of opening the snap.

As soon as I finish taking the screenshot, I get a flood of texts from her, pleading me to not open that, that it wasn't meant for me, that I shouldn't see what it is, etc. It occurred to me then, that it hadn't occurred to me that it may not have been for me. The texts stopped as abruptly as they began, as I assumed she got the screenshot notification. Still awaiting the aftermath, but yeah. In the most glorious and serendipitous way, I FU.

edit: woo! front page!! *Also, update: I talked with her, and of course I deleted the image entirely. Didn't back it up or anything. She's a sweet girl and is really embarrassed, and I couldn't keep it with good conscious. I told her I'd never bring this up again and she's actually being pretty cool about it, no awkward feelings.

edit 2: Nice! Popped my gold cherry too! Thank you kind stranger!"
36qpub,non_TBI,"This girl texted me the other day and I was reminded of my huge fuckup on our first date, which was about a year ago.

So I know her from highschool in our hometown, but I hadn't seen her for 5 years. I saw her working in a bar, we talked a little and exchanged phone numbers. Few weeks later we planned our date, which was at 22.00 but we hadn't decided on the location yet. The day of our date the fuckup began..

She texted me that morning saying :""You should really know I had a huge crush on you five years ago.."". I kind of freaked out and didnt know how to react. I was hanging out with some friends of mine when she called me to ask where we were going to meet. Having set the location, I hung up the phone and told my buddies about the text I had recieved that morning. One of them told me I was definitely getting laid that night, that I should take advantage of the situation. Some typical drunken male trashtalking ensued. I told them there was a thin line between taking advantage and being taken advantage of, and left for the date.

So it's 22.00 and she isnt there. 22.15, still no one. At 22.30 she walked in and acted super cold. She didnt order a drink and was obviously not willing to have a normal conversation. After ten minutes she asked: ""So who are you going to take adventage of tonight?""

Turns out I didn't hang up the phone when I meant to and she heard everything. EVERYTHING.

TLDR; Didnt hang up the phone when I meant to and my date overheard me and my friends trashtalking about me getting some tonight. Didnt get any."
3jpsuh,non_TBI,"This past week I've been exhausted and have had some trouble getting up at a decent time. I am supposed to be up at six but even with my seven different alarm clocks set up on my phone to play Eye of the Tiger at varying times, I have been unable to wake myself any later than 6:50. So of course, I thought that the sound of Shia Lebouf's ""Do It"" would be a good alternative to help wake me up. So, I set it for 5:59AM with max volume and thought everything would be dandy. Unfortunately I forgot I had set the alarm and the next morning my phone began blaring Shia's screams. I immediately thought a man had broken into my home and was screaming at me. I jumped out of bed with my eyes half shut, my pulse furiously racing, and throwing karate kicks...only to eventually notice the 'intruder' yelling things like ""YESTERDAY YOU SAID TOMORROW! ...SO  JUST DO IT!!"" Long story short, it woke me up but I was freaking terrified.

2ryked,non_TBI,"TIFU when I decided that I would try to be extra sexy while going down on my boyfriend. As he was close to climaxing, I tried (partially successfully) to deep throat him to give him that extra oomph.  
Well, I managed to gag right as he was finishing.  

Cough…sputter…Snort.


While he's in the throes of ecstasy, I have cum shooting out of my nose and tears running out of my eyes (Semen in the sinuses burns). 

I'm trying to sniffle it back in quietly and cover the lower half of my face. Me: ""Was it good for you?"" sniff. Sniff. SNIFFFFFFFFFF--Hand still over the face, trying to hide it and act as normally as possible. I pretended everything went exactly how it was meant to.


Him (trying not to laugh, because he completely knew what had just happened, even though I was still in denial): ""Do you need to go to the bathroom?""

Me: ""Yes please"" 

I spent the next ten minutes trying to rinse what could have been my children out of my nose."
438h9g,non_TBI,"Well, I knew this day would come. The day I visit this subreddit with the intention of posting as opposed to browsing. I'm aware of the general opinion that the majority of posts adorning this community are fake, though they make great stories. I'm afraid this one isn't fake. I know... That's just what a dirty, lying bitch would say.

A few weeks/months ago, I had smashed a picture frame hanging on my bedroom wall. I threw a screwdriver at it. I can't quite remember why I threw it, but I remember that I did it. The glass smashed, and fell to the floor along with the frame itself. There were some clothes underneath, clothes which were used to gather the broken glass and subsequently thrown out.

Fast forward to the day before yesterday. ""TDBYIFU"" doesn't have the same ring to it, so suspend your disbelief regarding the title. I'm sat at the PC, and like any self-respecting member of society, I decided to play with the member of my pants. It was a flippant decision, one I took on board with enthusiasm due to the urge not striking me very often because of my medication.

I'm reaching the vinegar strokes and things are looking good. As good as things can look through the squinted eyes of a man succumbing to his base urges. I suddenly realise that I have nothing to catch my maybe babies. One hand fumbles for something while the other fumbles my ding dong. I feel fabric, and snatch it up. it's an old T-shirt, one I'm happy to discard after the deed is done. It feels great. I catch the result with the precision of a cat snatching a housefly. Now comes clean up time.

Let's not kid ourselves. We know how this ends.

My thoughts turn from post fumbling bliss to pure horror, as I drag shards of broken glass across the tip of my tender doodle. It took me a second to realise what had happened. The fact that things are still super sensitive down there, coupled with the glass being razor sharp means that I don't quite notice until one complete wipe.

Yes, there was blood. Yes, there was mental scarring. It's healing nicely though which is good.

TLDR; I almost gave myself a penectomy."
3i8r7e,non_TBI,"So this really happened yesterday but it's still bad. So I was out shopping with my GF at a popular sporting goods store. She generally doesn't like going with me because I take my sweet ass time looking at anything I find appealing. Kinda like she does to me when she shops. It's a good way to get back at her for her shopping expeditions. Anyway, the entire time she was following me and she kept running into me. So I asked her, ""Why do you keep bumping into me?"" She replied, ""Inertia..."" Without thinking I said, ""Well maybe if you didn't have so much mass..."" Her jaw dropped so fucking fast she probably has lock jaw. 

Update 1: So I told her about the post and told her about what yall were saying. She found the post. Now I owe her something shiny and a margarita. "
407q3j,non_TBI,"This fuck up actually happened 6 years ago and i think my family will never let me forget it.  
&nbsp;


When I was 18 me and my BF decided we should have sex for the first time! All went well...yay us!    

Life goes on, a couple of months later and I am sitting at the doctors appointment. After I tell my doctor I am no longer a virgin she informs me I should do a pap test and I was like ""oh ok, yeah, maybe I should"". (For those of you who don't know, a pap test is used to look for changes in the cells of the cervix or vagina that show cancer or conditions that may develop into cancer.)  

She goes to set it up but the hospital computer system wasn't working so she says ""I can't set up a date right now, your mother is scheduled to come here next week, can I tell her the date or do you prefer that I call you?""  I was very social awkward so I say ""No no, just tell my mother the date and she will tell me"".  

This is where the fuck up begins...  
I am home, both me and my older sister are helping my mom preparing dinner, you know, just chopping onions, potatoes while goofing around and I tell her ""So, hey mom, next week when you go to the doctor please ask her the date for my pap test"" complete and absolute silence...and I was like ""hey mom? you heard me?""...and she looks at me strange and puts down the knife and just keeps staring while my sister facepalms really hard. So I realize something is wrong and I start to get nervous. My sister says ""we will be right back"" and pulls me to the living room while my mom just stands there looking at me in complete silence.  
I was so confused, and my sister starts laughing and says ""WTF are you doing? Are you stupid?"".  I didn't understand what this was about and my sister realizing that starts laughing even harder ""ooooh my god! you didn't know? At this age the only reason for you to do a pap test is if you had sex"". As soon as she ends that phrase in comes my father and he just looks at us and asks ""who had sex?"" oops...it was at this moment I knew I had fucked up.       
  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;  
 

tl;dr: Told mom my doctor was going to inform her of my pap test date. Sister laughs, pulls me aside and explains that the only reason to do a pap test at this age is if I had sex. Father arrives and hears everything.

3cwpts,non_TBI,"Ok so this didn't happen today, but a few years ago. I recently discovered TIFU so I thought I'd submit my fuck up. 

Ok so my family was chilling next door at the neighbours so I decided to get my vibrator out (I'm a girl and was 18 at the time) so anyway I plug the toy in and get to work. It was going great until I squirted (TMI but it's important) I must've got some of it on the plug or whatever and it ended up shocking me! 

It was the single most painful thing that has EVER happened to me! In the shock my vagina decided to completely fuck me over and clamped down on the toy and wouldn't let go! (There's a technical name for it but I can't remember it) 

In pain from the shock and now the muscle spasms in my vagina. I spent forty minutes trying to pry the toy out. In the end I gave up and shouted for my mum from across the gardens. She came in, I explained what had happened. 

She took me to A&E and I was given a muscle relaxer. The toy slid out and I left mortified. Imagine explaining what had happened to twenty+ staff and watching them trying not to laugh. I couldn't look anyone in the eye Including my family for the next year! 

TL;DR electrocuted myself with a sex toy and was sent to A&E after my vagina wouldn't let go!

Update: wow front page! :) to answer a couple questions. 
Yes my vagina is working properly, there was no lasting damage.
Haven't used a toy since haha :)
And it wasn't the wand thing I used :D just a regular vibrator,that 
was plugged in whilst charging :) 
I'm British so sorry for using A&E which means accident and emergency :)
And I've never questioned electrocuted until I read the comments! :D 
Some of these comments have me crying!! 
"
34rq0e,non_TBI,"This happened like 20 minutes ago js.
So for some back story here, our house has two bathrooms, the old nasty one my siblings and I share, and the glorious palace of a dumpsight that my parents have attached to their bedroom.  It's larger than my bedroom and has a Jacuzzi and all kinds of goodies.  Anyway, we recently got a new clutch of chickens, and they are still too small to survive the outdoor nights, so they spend the night in a cardboard box in the  Chateau de Guano.  
So here's the FU.  I had just come in from cutting the grass.  I have pretty nasty allergies, so priority #1 was get this shit off me.  So I head to my normal shower, but, It is occupied by my sister (It's worth noting she usually takes at least an hour to empty her bowels) So I figured, My parents aren't home yet, I'll use theirs.  BAD IDEA #1.
So I spend a good fifteen minutes using all the fancy soaps and stuff I found in there, and step out admiring the now steam filled palace.  Then it hit me.  I don't have a towel with me.  No problem, I thought, There is a closet right behind the box with the chicks.  So my American Ninja Warrior mindset kicked in.  Who cares if the floor is wet, I can jump it? Right?  BAD IDEA #2.  I slam butt first into the pine shaving filled shit hole, and managed to burn my back on the heat light in the process.  Meanwhile all the chickens went full panic mode and started flying all over me in my birthday suit.  I can't hold back a scream as my willy gets clawed at by the force of 6 angry peeps. BAD IDEA #3
SO My dad had gotten home in the time of my shower, and he burst through the door, concerned about my health, and BAM. He I am. Butt naked. In a box. With 6 baby chickens. Haven't left my room since.

tl:dr Caught naked with some chicks, My pecker got pecked by a pack of little peckers.

[Edit] We only keep the chickens in the box at night, to prevent them from freezing.  So it's not a 24/7 thing. Also no chickens died and my dad was not naked.


"
45e8wp,non_TBI,"Ok, I just fucked up about 2 days ago. I tried posting before, but it was removed. I am on my phone as well so excuse my formatting, but I think I can manage. 

So backstory real quicklike, I went snowboarding not long ago, I ate shit,  it was my first time, and I cracked a rib, sprained my wrist. 

I'm visiting in town for my grandmother's funeral. I'm at my other grandmother's and I decided to run a bubble bath. Soaking these aching, cracked and sprained bones in hot and heavy water would be amazing right now. 

So... this is where I fuck up but didn't know it yet. 

I run a bath, I normally check the tub for things like hair or whatever before I get in, but I'm high on xanax, so I don't pay any attention to the tub. I just run the bath, squeeze in some shampoo or something to make bubbles, grab the clothes I am going to put on, come back and it looks good. It's hot, it's heavy. 

I soak, and ohhhh. It's exhilarating. The nostalgic bathtub, the warm water, the bubbles, but then.. the smell...

My grandfather has Alzheimer's and dementia. He's gotten progressively worse.

He was known to hide his diapers in random places, he's even tried to flush one once. 

So I soak, I feel great, right?
No, left. 

Turns out earlier that day he had an episode, and as I went to get out, I could feel small chunks hitting my body. I noticed small brown chunks on me as well. I felt something cling to my foot. Turns out, I soaked in murky brown water for 5-10 minutes with a diaper. A shitty diaper.  I puked. 

TL;DR: Cracked a rib, ran the bathtub, clung a diaper, became the shattub


Edit:  you guys are fucking hilarious. I love reddit. 

TIFU by posting a truly bizarre thing that happened to me on a subreddit meant for truly bizarre/awkward happenings. "
2k6sug,non_TBI,"Okay, so this was not today, but years ago. When I was in 4th grade, my little sister (in 1st grade) had to do a show-and-tell on what their favorite fruit was, and present it to both my class and hers at once. My class had to be there to give my sister's class experience in presenting to their peers or something, I am not sure. I was unaware my class would watch her class's presentation until the day of.

The day before the presentation, my little sister asked me ""what is my favorite fruit?"" And, thinking she said ""food"", I said ""well, you sure love ham a lot”. Day of the show-and-tell, her classmates are presenting their favorite fruits in front of all of us. I realize, ""oh no...she said 'FRUIT', not 'food' yesterday"". She was in line to the front of the class with a proud look on her face, not realizing the impending doom. 

She gets to the front of the room and holds up a fucking slice of ham in a little ziplock baggie. She states confidently “ My favorite fruit is HAM!” The entirety of my class and hers laughed in her face. The teacher had to explain to her that ham is not a fruit while I was silently shaking with laughter. I couldn’t make eye contact with my sister for a few days after that. She still brings it up to this day.

Edit: Okay, so I have not made contact with my sister yet. I am sure she will kill me, maybe I should write my last will and testament here. EDIT EDIT: my sister, username pineconedragon, said ""I'm going to make you wish it didn't happen either. -love, Your sister"" BRING IT ON SIS, BRING IT AWWWN http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2k6sug/tifu_by_mishearing_my_little_sister/clj46zh

To give credit to my little sister, she asked me what her favorite fruit was. And I, mishearing her, said ""ham"". She believed me because, being 3 years older than her, she trusted my authority on what is and is not a fruit. Sorry sis, I love ya.

Also, thank you for the gold. I can use it to make me feel better about betraying my sister. HA JUST KIDDING THIS IS HILARIOUS (I expect a more embarrassing story to show up on Reddit soon from her about me. That's just straight up karma, but I will ride this high for a while until my inevitable downfall.)"
46fki9,non_TBI,"This is literally happening right now. Like most of us I use the same (really complicated) password everywhere because I can't be bothered to have to remember multiple passwords. So as you can imagine this came back to bite me in the ass... I got an email from Steam saying that someone tried to log into my account from the middle of fuck-knows-where USING MY PASSWORD. I was in a class when I got this email and knew that I didn't have any credit card information or anything on Steam so the guy couldn't screw me up too hard right?

Well yes and no. He didn't do anything on Steam, but did try to log into my facebook since it used the same password and email address. Now I'm in full freak out mode and change my password for facebook, Steam, twitter, my bank account, and anything else I could think of off the top of my head. Still a week after the initial Steam login I get emails from random websites saying that someone logged in, or tried to change passwords or whatever the hell else. 


TL;DR don't use the same password for all your accounts everywhere."
2c8zbx,non_TBI,"Like most of the TIFU stories this didn't happen today, but rather 5 years ago when I was about 12 years old. My brother (we'll call him Mike) and I were in my room late at night, bored when he showed me his new laser pointer he'd just bought.  

After minutes of messing around with the laser, my 12 year old mind thought it would be a funny idea to shine the laser up my brother's ass to see his lit up anal cavity. Keep in mind we were just weird little 12 year olds when this happened (so we didn't think it was all that odd).

After a few minutes of exploring the depths of my brothers butthole, we both thought it would be even funnier to poke a hole through a water bottle and pour water up his butt and then shine the laser to see what that looked like...We did this and Mike muttered the words ""I don't feel good"" because honestly who would feel good with water poured up their butt? 

What happened next was a moment of my childhood that I'll never forget and is still one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. My dad opened the door to see the sight of me shining a laser in my brothers butt. This must have been nerve-racking for my brother, because he tensed up and shot poop water directly in my face as my poor dad witnessed the entire scene. My dad immediately closed the door once he saw this and he hasn't spoken a word of it since.


**TL;DR:** Shined laser and poured water in brother's butthole, dad walked in, frightened brother spewed his butt juice on my face.

**EDIT**: Thanks to /u/Cyae1 for narrating this TIFU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowMaBzVvEM&list=PLl0DkyQa9Aqu_aWjvjzvySIZC8PHUPPO6&index=25 

**EDIT 2:** Thanks for the gold!

**EDIT 3:** WOW! Did not expect all the hype and I've been reading comments all night laughing. As for my brother I showed him the post and he can't believe this is so popular, also he seems to be reliving the worst part of his childhood.
"
2baxhl,non_TBI,"So it wasn't today but last week. My son is 6 years old and has recently become obsessed with cars and robots, so being an idiot I thought it would be great to show him the transformers movie. Now I have not seen the movie in a few years. And I don't know if you remember but in the movie 'Sam' the main character is in his room with the door locked. His parents come up and try to get in and can't. His mother them asked him if he is masturbating. My son being curious asked what that means and I panicked and decided to tell him it just means playing with toys. He accepts this definition and I hope he forgets about it. 

The next day comes and my wife calls him down to dinner. She asked what he was doing up in his room and he says (wanting to be cool like to movie) that he was masturbating, I start laughing and she yells ""What!"" He replies that he was just masturbating with the new toys I bought him. I at this point cannot stop laughing and she asks him where he learned that word. After we figure everything out we explain only grow-ups can use that word. 

Sorry for poor English and grammar. English is not my first language 

Edit: I'm on the first page! Wow! Thanks everyone!
Also I have taken some of your advice and talked to my son to clarify some issues. I basically told him
""Masturbating is what grown ups do on their own in their rooms."" And to ask me again when he turns 10 to learn more I hope this will clarify previously stated issues some of you had about my parenting. Thank you for all the feedback I shall read every single comment you leave. Thank you.

Edit: Thank you for the gold stranger! I have never had gold before. I'm happy you enjoyed my post! Thank! "
3cd1vl,non_TBI,"I was eye flirting with this girl earlier while pumping gas.

She came over and introduced herself. Being the flirting dude I am, I smoothly smiled and said ""Digiorno"". I wanted to say Bonjour, but I screwed up, and she laughed and went back to her car and left after pumping gas.

"
3dze5l,non_TBI,"So this literally just happened...

I went over to Subway for lunch and there was a large black man in line in front of me talking on his phone all the way up to the order line. The woman taking his order was rightfully pissed off at him for ignoring her and continuing to talk on the phone, when he finally hung up saying ""call me back in a minute, I need to order this shit."" He progressed to place his order, changing the bread choice 3 times, and then demanding they put mayo on the bread before they toast it. 

This is where things start to get ugly. As he is arguing with the lady behind the counter his phone goes off and a photo of a large black woman pops up onto his phone, in a bikini of all things, trying to look sexy...or so I would assume. The name ""Chocolate Butter"" caught my attention on the screen, and that's when things start to go horribly wrong. 

I burst out laughing uncontrollably, only to have this massive beast make eye contact with his phone and then me...His eyes looked like they could kill. He kept looking at me, not blinking, as my laughter slowly decreased to a smirk. 

""What the FUCK you laughing at?! You laughing at my BUTTER? FUCK YOU!"" 

He took a step in my direction and I noped the fuck out of there...

I'm currently sitting back at my desk in my office without any food. Sorry Butter lover!"
3muzxf,non_TBI,"Going to start off by saying that this person *is/was* a really good friend before this, this is happening **right now**.

1. Start seeing a girl
2. Girl and I have fucked up thoughts and say the worst things to each other.
3. We love each other a fucking ton
4. End up showing an out of context joke between us about her period
5. Basically saying things like *""bitch you wanted this, you asked for it, you like this don't you, yeah take this goopy mess you little bitch""* to each other. We (me and the girlfriend) think its hilarious.
6. I being the stupid shit I am, think my good friend will also find it hilarious.
7. **NOPE**
8. Turns out she is a *huge feminist, justice warrior ever* (her words not mine, *had to google justice warrior*) and is calling me every fucking name in the book (sexist, misogynist, woman hater, insensitive cis male, etc), has started making flamatry posts about me on facebook and twitter.
9. The fucked up part is that the girlfriend was the one who said the things she is upset about. GF is now defending me, and they are fighting, GF has expressed she wants me to drop this person as a friend.
10. Girl has threatened to bring friends to ""teach me a lesson"" to my GF.
11. GF laughed and told her to do it, she knows I can stand my ground, and said she will be there to watch.

At this point... I'm not sure what to do. This went from funny to me having to potentially defend myself for my GF jokes about herself to some overly sensitive person...

**TL;DR** GF & I joke around about periods, tell friend, she blows out of proportion and threatens me with violence, GF escalates situation.

---

**UPDATE 1** I blocked her. (This only added fuel to the fire according to GF, who has yet to block her)

**UPDATE 2** Her friends are jumping in on it, messaging me directly. Apparently, I promote rape, and self hate.

---

**UPDATE 3** They contacted my place of work. (My boss is calling me...)

**UPDATE 4** My boss is on the floor laughing, didn't know feminists were a real thing

---

**UPDATE 5** WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER THIS HAS BEEN. So one kid, lets say his name is **John**, asks me if I said those things (wow, what a cool dude, everyone else just jumped on me), I tell John which one were mine and which one were hers, he tells me that's not what the girl is telling everyone, and how she is portraying it, so my GF confirms what I'm saying to John.

Now John is livid... John hates being lied to. John is a really cool dude at this point in my eyes, I can see us being bros. So John goes back to this hivemind, and essentially starts telling them the true story. John is **one of us** to them so they all start believing John and turning on the girl.

Girl posts a video of her crying (GF shows me), saying that John is spreading lies, and now nobody is believing her. John comes back saying that this girl likes me, and was trying to break me and my GF up. I have no idea how she would do that, since it was my GF messages. She thought if people hated me my GF would leave me?? what?

She tells my GF to tell me she is sorry, and has started deleting all of her posts and videos, and my GF told her that I want nothing to do with this, and she's toxic, etc, and to go cry to someone else.

**TL;DR** John is a total bro, girl gets ousted from her hivemind, GF tells girl to get ricked, and girl was trying to use this to sabotage my relationship.

---

I showed this to my boss, he's laughing even more now (and learning a bunch of new words), and says you all are awesome."
2yfpvf,non_TBI,"Happened just this morning.

While brushing our teeth, I left the water running which I usually don't.  My son says to me, ""We need to conserve water, you should turn that off.""  

It was so unexpected, especially coming from my little dude, that I reacted without thinking and asked, ""What are those godless liberals teaching you at school?""

Of course kids pick up new, interesting phrases and he started parroting it back to me all morning and all the way to his daycare/preschool.  ""Apple juice is godless liberals, I don't want it."" ""Mommy, is that tree a godless liberal?""  ""Mommy, traffic is godless liberal.""  ""Godless liberals are making the air stink."" (As we're passing the local paper mill.)  

I really, really tried to discourage him saying it but damn, it was funny and I laughed just a little too much.

I didn't notice all last week but they're doing a ""Conservation"" theme at school this month and he noticed me noticing all the eco swag on the walls when we walked in.  So, of course the first thing he says when we greet his teacher is, ""Conserving water is godless liberals.""   Ffffffffffffff!

Now everyone thinks I'm a raging fundie Republican.  I mean, there are worse things to be in South Carolina but damn.

TL;DR OMFG, just read it you lazy godless liberal.

Edit : (removed, personal information) Dude deleted it anyways.

Edit! Part Deux : First, thanks for the gold!  There goes my cherry.  Second, holy shit.  SJW's are out in force.  I'm a godless liberal living in the seat of religious political conservatism.  You gotta laugh to keep from crying sometimes.  Calm down."
40dryy,non_TBI,"So this afternoon I was mid fap and I heard my phone buzz. I looked over and saw that I had received a snapchat from a girl that I know pretty well from my athletics team, who is also pretty hot. So, feeling frisky, I decided that right before the moment suprême I would open the snapchat and cum to her picture.

I was fapping away and was almost about to come when I opened the picture.... It was a picture of a dead pigeon she had found lying on the street. At this exact moment I came and because I was caught off guard it got all over my shirt and pants.. After a few seconds of cumming the entire realisation of shame and disgust came over me and I hobbled to the toilet to clean myself up.

TL;DR: Fapped to a dead bird"
35dnb4,non_TBI,"It's not a very entertaining story, but it will have a good moral at the end for all you young people about my stupidity. Slightly nsfw.

I had a girfriend of 4 years and we broke up. There's a quote from an old movie that goes something like this: you can love them all your life and then stop loving on Thursday. You know, it comes to a point when you just can't bear the person anymore, even if you still love them. 

So when we broke up, it wasn't even hard or bad, I was relieved. For the first time in years I felt some peace in my soul, this serenity and I almost remembered what it's like to be happy. And I thought to myself that I want this feeling to stay, I will not do anything against my will ever again and will be open to everything I come across. Just let go and flow with the tide, right? 

Of course, it backfired just a couple of days later. My friend had a birthday and we went to the woods camping for three days. And there was this girl: 19 years old, freckles, great tits and was the most strange thing ever — seems like she was into me. So we hit it. My friends at this point don't know me and my gf broke up so they're giving me these angry looks like ""Wtf man? What are you doing? Are you seriously considering doing her?"". That was hard to withstand and also funny in some weird way. Anyway, we get drunk, and she's more and more willing. I have to say that I'm a shy guy(24) and never even came up to a girl on the street and all my sexual ""adventures"" was with someone I knew for some time and I never had any random one night stands. This is new, strange and EXACTLY what I want cause hey I'm a yes man for tonight. 

My friends are already starting to be vocal, trying to pun me and joke about us, so I get pissed at them (mostly because implying she's a whore may offend her and then I won't get any), say them to fuck off and storm off to the beach alone, thinking it's over and they deliberately done it to piss me off and to prevent me from having sex, those bastards. And then she comes like nothing happened, calms me and we almost have sex right there on the beach. 

We run to my tent, drunk as hell, hot and all over each other. She's probably the most gorgeous woman I've been with: young, very smooth skin, big tits and ass, lips that you wanna just bite off and the tighest, most magnificent pussy ever. We undress each other and I lay on the bottom and then something terrifying happens: she starts giving me a blowjob and I close my eyes, but in a minute she stops and sits on me. I wasn't prepared for that. I sobered for a second, because I DIDN'T USE A CONDOM and she's already fucking me. Never having any unprotected (or with an unchecked partner) sex this really scares me even through all the alcohol. I was so mad at her for not saying anything, for just going in, never asking me shit and all that, but in the end it's my fault and responsibility too, so I say something like ""hey bby move"", dump her off me and finally get a condom from by backpack. We proceed and I fall asleep with the thing on. What can go wrong, right? She's 19, 19yo girls are shy and carefull, right? You probably can guess what happens next... 

We did it again the next night. And then couple of times again when we returned to the city. Protected now, of course. It was awesome, but I couldn't get that first time out of my head. But in a week my dick starts to hurt, more and more and I freak out. I go to the doctor and get like 7 or 8 tests done, even for HIV because fuck it. Aaaaand — Herpes. I have a fucking herpes, probably the worst thing after HIV cause you can't cure it. I had unprotected sex literaly one time in my life, for less than a minute, with a young and should-be-clean girl and bam — herpes. I have a semi-compromised immune system and it sticks, and I have to eat Aciclovir every damn day or I get pimples and ache on my penis. Probably, for life.

Oh and also now I need to have ""The Talk"" about it with every woman I'll intend to have a serious relationship. She even said to me once that her mother always told her it's better to have an std than get pregnant. Lol. Yup.

 Don't get me wrong, the disease itself is fine, you live a normal life like with an allergy, just eating pills from time to time. It's my own fault and I promised myself to never be sorry about that week. What gets me is this....karma I've got. The only time in years I let myself go and this happens, instantly. Stupidity, alcohol, nice tits and you can lose your head and do the craziest things. It could've been worse. But it could've been much mech better, It's been almost a year since that and I still don't know how will I tell a girl I really like (because fuck one night stands) that I'm sick and we'll have to deal with that.

**tl;dr**: had first unprotected sex ever, insta herpes. Don't do that.

The moral of this story is simple: kids, always use a condom and don't you ever fuck a stranger, even if it's a hot barely legal girl that wants you bad. 

edit: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/35dnb4/tifu_for_life_by_sleeping_with_a_hot_19yo_girl/cr3k1bs) is what happened after

edit: people are suggesting I might had it before. I read a lot about it, double checked it, talked to a few doctors and I'm sure that was the date and place I got it. My ex tested negative (yup I told her just in case) and my previous relationship was almost 6 years ago, so, having health issues (with immune system) I think there would be some outbreaks in 6 years if I had it before or I would transmitted it to my gf of 4 years. 

hopefully, last edit: so this is over 2000 posts now, I can't catch on. If tou have any questions please pm me, I can't read all these posts.

**LAST ONE, IMPORTANT EDIT**: I've had so many pm's people asking advice or what to do so I decided to keep this account. If you have any troubles, questions or just want to talk to someone feel free to PM me, I will read and answer to everyone."
31ktjc,non_TBI,"I did this earlier today and the anxiety rash is still fresh. 

I work in healthcare and it's in an impoverished part of town in Florida....so we get some interesting names and people. Mind you, my first name is very VERY strange by any typical standards thanks to my super traditional ethnic parents so I understand the struggle from a personal perspective. I do pediatric acute care and we see a lot of variants of names for little kids that were clearly taken from a city/town/location/car/famous individual but altered to make it unique. I've seen variations of Mercedes and Bentley I could have never been creative enough to come up with myself. When it comes to places: brooklynn, londyn, A'sia, Cuba, etc. and contrary to popular belief this is not just one kind of demographic doing this with their kids. I think it's more a southern thing than a race thing. Anyway, I've worked here long enough that I know the drill - parents calls about a kid, take down information, if its a weird name have them spell it out. Sometimes I'm the only one fielding phone calls and we have 3 or 4 lines lit at once - so I really need to do things as quickly and as efficiently as possible so everyone is reached in adequate time. Here's where I fuck up. 

Had a patient call and say her child's name is Malaysia. I've seen MANY variants on this name, so for accuracy/time's sake I ask her if it's spelled like the country's name. ....Mom had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to brush by it and just spell it out rather than ask that question again. Honestly, all I really needed was an accurate spelling. I didn't realize at the time mom had just been floored by my meant-to-be harmless question. 

""What in the hell you mean like the country?""
""Ma'am, I apologize, I just needed the spelling of your child's name for medical record purposes. M-A-L-A-Y-S-I-A is correct?""
""Hold the f- up. You said COUNTRY. You tellin' me there's a country named after my child?""
""No ma'am. Well, yes ma'am. But the country I think came first. It's been around a while, it's in Asia. What's her date of birth?""
""You tryna' make fun now? You think you so smart and I'm so dumb that you can say something like that about my child's name and I won't catch it?""
""No ma'am! I just am trying to get you into triage quickly ma'am. I'm sorry. I didn't mean any offense. I just used the country for reference. I apologize."" (I start to clam up realizing this is devolving from her raised tone of voice.)
""Fuck you and your lyin' ass talking to me like I don't fucking know countries and shit, that's some fucked up dumb shit, you RACIST, you trying to JUDGE, and think I won't catch it, no, nuh uh, I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR RIGHT THIS SECOND.""

Anyway so now I have to do sensitivity training because I'm an asshole and she didn't know Malaysia was a country and not just her baby daddy's favorite cousin's name. 


**Edit:** I've heard ghastly stories about things people say in healthcare settings, and just ignorance in general from all levels, professions, and demographics of people coming through. This is by far my worst/weirdest yet. 

**Second edit based on the messages I'm getting:** Guys, I'm an Asian woman with a strange as hell name. And Floridian redditors, you guys know what I'm talking about.


**Final Edit hopefully:** I did my sensitivity training early this week and everything is all good. Pub subs (for those of you that know them) were a lunch option and the day wasn't as terrifying as I had initially thought. Thanks for all the support guys :) And for all of you reprimanding folk out there - go work in retail/clerical/call center type jobs and see how you feel. If you're feeling brave try one in the South. "
40ki6y,non_TBI,"I was at Wegmans and was picking up some yogurt.

Most people know that there are usually people behind the yogurt and dairy sections of supermarkets. When the displays get empty, they load more in from the back.

Well there was a guy working behind the yogurts while I was picking them out. And it was extremely dark in that back space. And the guy working was black.

So while I was reaching for the yogurts in the back, I feel something smooth that doesn't feel like a wall. I've accidentally touched the guy's face. 

I don't think I've sprinted away from anywhere faster than that. Luckily there weren't many people around to see me."
40896z,non_TBI,"I met a girl a few weeks ago and we've been on one date so far, just casual coffee/chit-chat. Today was our second date, I invited her to my place and I was going to prepare dinner for us both and watch a movie.

She told me before we met that she's incredibly allergic to peanuts. No biggie. I'm not too fussy for peanuts but sometimes I cook with them. I buy some peanuts, roast them, grind them up a bit, and put in a peppermill for when I feel a meal could use with a bit more savory saltiness. I use them maybe once a month. A buddy of mine is also allergic to peanuts, so I do wash my things thoroughly so as to not have lingering peanuttiness for when he visits.

So I make a beautiful dinner: pork roast rolled with prosciutto and olive oil, with some vegetables and beans, and a little bit of gnocchi. I made a nice sauce to go with it. To note I didn't add any peanuts. I ask her to set the table: she grabs forks, knives, spoons, wine glasses, salt shaker and peppermill.

You can probably see where this is going, but the tl;dr is she grabbed the wrong peppermill (she didn't grab the one sitting beside the salt shaker, but instead went into a cupboard to get my peanutmill). Sprinkled some on her food, took a bite, and immediately had a violent reaction. She seized up, couldn't talk, was burning up, the whole nine yards for ""oh fuck what do I do?"".

I went into her purse (my father always told me to never go into a woman's purse for any reason, but I felt this was an emergency) to look for an Epipen. Thankfully she had one. I've got no idea how to use this thing: I know you jab it in your thigh or butt, but is it over clothes? Under clothes? Reading instructions be damned, I had to take her pants off. Undid her belt, slid down her jeans, and unfortunately her underwear slid off when the pants came down. I get a good look at the sight but there was no time for that, into her thigh the Epipen went. She calms down a bit and 911 is called since I honestly don't know what else to do. She hurriedly struggles to put her pants on and begins to cry, and she sits in silence, shaking, for the ambulance.

I feel real bad and haven't moved from my couch since. This happened just under two hours ago and haven't called her (or received a call back). I'm sure she's okay, but I don't think this is how our second (maybe final?) date should have gone.

**tl;dr: peanut-allergic date accidentally sprinkles peanut dust on the meal I made. Had a reaction. Took off her clothes to use an EpiPen not knowing if it could be used over clothes or not.**

*Update 1*: I gave her a call and her mother picked up. I explained what happened and she said her daughter was fine. She's resting right now and said she'll have her give me a call tomorrow. She completely understands and says she isn't upset, just awkward the date turned out like that.

*Update 2*: She stopped by about fifteen minutes ago (completely unannounced) and wanted to apologize to me for how she reacted. I don't know why she's apologizing: she didn't do anything wrong, but she gave me a hug and said we can continue the date another day, but asked me why I had peanuts in a peppermill.

*Update 2.5*: To those asking why I have a ""peanutmill"", it's just for ease of use. If a recipe calls for a dash of peanut dust or something, I'm not going to take out my mortar and pestle, take out a peanut or two, grind it up, then put in the meal, every time I need 'em. I put them in a food processor so they're small enough to fit in a peppermill, put it in the mill, then whenever I need it, it's handy. I'm sure lots of people put things other than pepper in a peppermill for a similar reason. I keep my ""peanutmill"" in the cupboard and the peppermill and salt shaker on my countertop. I wouldn't have assumed she'd have to look for the peppermill and stumble upon the peanuts, else I'd have hidden them a bit more.

*Update 2.75*: Here's a way I'd use a peanutmill:

- chicken breast (150g maybe?), filleted so it's thin
- knead peanut dust into the meat, add salt and pepper
- wrap in prosciutto, keep a small skewer or something on the top side to keep it bound if it doesn't readily stay put
- fry in 2tbsp olive oil on medium heat with half a crushed clove of garlic
- I'm not good at gauging doneness, so I usually go 4-5 minutes, flipping two or three times and then cut a piece off to check inside
- set the wrapped breast aside to rest
- add a knob of butter to the remaining olive oil, 1 or 2 crushed blueberries, a small squirt of tomato puree. Deglaze with red wine (only a little bit)
- reduce, add corn starch + water for desired thickness
- apply to chicken breast

And peanut dust also goes well with sautee'd vegetables, mushrooms, or just on top of food. Most of the ways I use it is kneading into meat or on top of things. It's wonderful on salmon.

*Update 3*: She's inviting me to her house tonight (she lives with parents) so they can see the goof who almost killed their daughter. None of them are upset, they think it's hilarious. Then we're going to go see a movie.

*Final Update*: Her family is real cool, and completely understanding. They like me and I like them. We canceled our movie date and I'm spending the night here. I think I'm in lads."
31nyc5,non_TBI,"So, my coworker recently showed me /r/unexpectedjihad and we currently have a running joke in the office with the microwave, which most people can hear from their offices.  Well I came in from lunch a little late and did not realize there was a meeting going on in the conference room.  I have the door to my office about 4/5ths shut and did not see who walked into the kitchen. I few mins go by and I hear the microwave finish ""BEEP BEEP"" and bellow a solid ""ALLAU AKBAAAAR!"".  I just hear a confused ""What"" from an unfamiliar voice.  It was a middle eastern guy that is our company's main contact for a large account that we manage.  I run out and try to explain that it is a thing on the internet and just a joke, but it one of those things were you are walking on thin ice around a dicey subject and you start digging yourself deeper into a hole

2s71wq,non_TBI,"So to start, I'll let you know I had a very big night last night, and drank more than I should have. A lot more than I should have. 

Anyways, cut to this morning, I wake up feeling surprisingly ok, and have the biggest craving for some chicken nuggets. So I had down to the hungry jacks just down the road and proceed to eat 6 nuggets before I get the overwhelming urge to throw up. So being the polite person I am, I run to the nearest bin outside, which unbeknownst to me at the time, had a pigeon feasting on the food inside. I had already began violently vomiting up the contents of my stomach into the bin and all over this pigeon, which then promptly freaked the fuck out and flew up out of the bin, splashing my vomit back up all over me in the process. "
2tg3yf,non_TBI,"Last night my wife and I went to dinner an a inexpensive sit down restaurant. It's been a very good year for us financially and once a month, we go out to eat and we will anonymously pay for a person's meal. We usually try to find an older person who eats alone because it's kind of sad and helps remind us of how lucky we are to have each other.

So, last night, we sit down and we notice three separate people eating alone. Right behind us is an angelic 80 something year old black lady. She is almost finished so we tell our server to pick up her ticket and add it to our bill and to not let her know it was us. She was very gracious and walked out with a huge smile on her face. The second person was an older gentleman with white hair and a walker. When he found out his meal was free, he told the server to tell us thank you and he left with a smile on his face. 

The last person was a man in his 70's. He was seated to our immediate right and when he asked the server for his ticket, she told him that it was paid for by another diner. This guy flipped his shit. He started screaming at the top of his lungs. ""I DON'T NEED ANYONE TO PAY FOR MY MEAL! I CAN PAY FOR MY OWN MEAL!"" He started waving his arms in the air and going berserk. The server tried to calm him down and told him that if it was that important, he could pay for his own meal. That seemed to calm him down and as he walk out of the room he turned back and shouted, ""WHOEVER TRIED TO PAY FOR MY MEAL, FUCK YOU TO HELL!"" And he walked out.

I have been doing this for years and I won't stop but I have to admit, that made my night.

***EDIT**** THANKS FOR THE GOLD! 

****EDIT #2**** I appreciate all of the positive comments. Not everyone is going to agree that paying for a stranger's meal who can obviously afford it is the ""right thing to do"". We also pay for service member's meals whenever we can. We also donate quite a bit to charities. As I posted in a response earlier, My mom is widowed and these people remind me of my mother. They also serve to remind me of how much I would miss my amazing wife if she were no longer with me. My children live 1800 miles and 2200 miles away. If my wife were to die, I would be the old man eating alone. While I ate, I would be reminded of my wife, I am sure. If someone were to pay for my meal, I would like to think that it would brighten my day. That's all there is to this. Nothing more. We just want to brighten someone's day. Yes, there are probably other ways that some of you think are more important but kindness does not have parameters."
3lleeo,non_TBI,"I bought a cuckoo clock for my wife as a housewarming present.  We moved in, placed the furniture, hung some pictures and all was right with the world.  I hung the cuckoo clock on a short wall beside the window in the living room.  It looked great and she loved it.

The next day, we went off to work.  Around 4 that afternoon, I get a call from the police.  They said they had to “track me down” because I hadn’t answered the number on file with the security company (I immediately checked my cell and it was dead).  There was a problem at the house, and I was told the police were waiting for me.   I asked what the problem was, and the response was, “Can I let them know you’re on your way?”  After I said yes, that was the end of the call.

I get home to find two police cars in the driveway.  I got out of the car and walked over to them and asked what was going on.  The first cop said, “Wait for it….” Then put up his index finger.  A few seconds later, the house alarm starts blaring.  “It’s been doing this all day”, they told me, even after the alarm company shut it down.  The house was secure, but the police went in first to clear it while I was on the phone with the alarm company getting instructions on how unplug the box and take out the battery.  

I was issued a ticket with a pretty hefty fine for repeated calls to a false alarm.  

The security company came in the next day to inspect the system.  I was mad and snippy.  He couldn’t answer for why the system did not remotely shut down, only saying that they reset themselves.  Still not sure about that.  Either way, I was all set to name them in a suit for the fines and court costs until the guy said, “Here’s your problem”.  He showed me that I had hung the cuckoo clock next to a motion sensor.   

I brought pictures with me to court and the judge had a good laugh.  He reduced the fine, but basically called me an idiot.  I can’t argue.

Tl/dr: Don’t hang a cuckoo clock beside a motion sensor.

32t6be,non_TBI,"So this happened like 3 weeks ago.

Me and my girlfriend of 3 years were sitting on her bed whilst she was doing here make-up and i was watching some TV. Usually we have these weird conversations that don't even make sense. We started talking about how everything we know and see could be fake, and that it could all be part of our own imagination. when we stopped talking for a couple of seconds she looked at me and said: ''maybe you aren't real either''. My girlfriend is the type of girl that is easy to persuade when it comes to these things and is interested in supernatural things, so I knew I had to do something evil. At this point im not even looking at her anymore and she continued doing her make-up. I lowered my voice and softly whispered: ''i'm not real''. Loud enough for her to hear but she still didn't look at me. she then said: ''I mean, it could be? Maybe you are just someone i made up in my mind and i'm just talking to myself right now''. Slowly i went to the other side of the bed while she was still talking about the same topic. When i finally got to the other side i hid myself behind the bed, she could not see me if she turned around. She didn't look up for like 30 seconds, but when she did she freaked out. real bad. real fast. she started crying out of nowhere because she really thought for a second that i didn't exist. I tried not to laugh and still hid myself but after 10 seconds of hearing her cry i showed myself.

We didn't talk for 2 days.

Edit: Cyae1 narrated this story, this just made my day [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBODrR-27zI)



Edit: A bit more background: My girlfriend and I scare eachother all the time. the truth is that she has this thing that if she gets scared real bad she starts to cry(first time she did), I just didn't know she would be like this.  The reason she didn't want to talk to me was because i couldn't stop laughing and didn't take her serious. I still bring this up if i need a good laugh, hope you did too.

Edit: We both laugh about it now and she doesn't mind it all. We are both looking through the comments and we cant believe the theories people come up with to give this all a reason. She got scared - She cried - We laughed in the end. 

Also, my native language isn't English, so spelling/grammar won't be on point all the time.


Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!"
2px7ct,non_TBI,"I was Christmas shopping with my wife(I'm 32 years old) and she decided to go to Ross. For those of you who don't know, Ross is mostly a clothing store. She was going to buy some clothes, so I decided to wait for her outside the changing rooms on some chairs they had. While I waited, I was playing Pokemon Heart Gold. I had just beaten the 2nd gym, and was looking for the HM Cut when this little kid, who couldn't have been older than 8 or 9, sat down next to me with his DS. He asked me ""What Pokemon game are you playing?"" And I told him Heart Gold. He then pops out the game in his DS and puts in a copy of Soul Silver.

I could see where this was going. I then playful exclaimed ""I challenge you to a Pokemon battle!"" and I started heading back to a Pokemon Center so I could battle him. This is where the fuck up happens.

I always nickname my Pokemon really dumb nicknames. For example, my Quilava's name is ""KidFucker"" and my Pidgey's name is ""PenisPump"". Right when we started the battle, I asked if we could restart, because I just noticed the name. Of course, his mom walks to him and looks at his DS and then looks at me in horror. She then starts yelling at me and causing a scene. I tried to calm her down but she was threatening to call the police.

Needless to say, I head out to the car and waited for my wife to finish shopping."
3x5kih,non_TBI,"So I'm going to start off by saying I lost my job, so I go around town doing odd jobs like painting and delivering food to the elderly people in town for a few extra bucks.  since it's almost christmas time, everyone has their family around and doesn't really need help.  so, I literally have 5$ in my pocket for lunch today.   so I'm in walmart buying one of their chicken parm sandwiches and a can of coke, when I walk up to mother and her daughter in line. [the little girl had holes in her pants and a stained shirt], and her mother kept telling her to put the doll she was carrying down because they didn't have the money to pay for it, and that she's sorry that they have to postpone Christmas until she has the funds. bluhbluhbluh girl crying.  

So I did the manly thing and put my lunch down and purchased the 4$ doll instead, and ran out to the parking lot to give it to the mother.   I got screamed at by the mother that her daughter doesn't need such a cheap toy, and that I should "" Mind my own fucking business about her daughter"", plus calling me a pervert while I'm holding a doll trying to give it to her daughter.

I went back into the store and tried to return it, but guess what?  no holiday refunds on toys.

BUT, I did give it to the mother of a little girl working in the nail salon with her daughter there, and that little girl was very grateful for the toy, and the mother shared her lunch with me.

TIL:Bought a little girl a toy, mother is a cunt, got called a pervert.  still helped out somebody."
2d4giz,non_TBI,"This is from when I was young, which is quite a few years ago, before internet porn.

First of all, a bit of scene-setting information. Our house was in a cul-de-sac, up on a hill and it was the only two-story house in a neighborhood of single-story houses. We were close to the road, too, so our house was very visible from everywhere in the neighborhood. 

When I was a teenager my parents worked late hours and I had the house to myself well into the evening. Quite often, I would spend a couple of hours leisurely browsing a stack of Playboy magazines that my father thought he had hidden from me. I had a particular jerking method I used. I would go upstairs to the living room, open a bunch of magazines to my favorite pages and lay them out on the floor. Then I’d stand up and jerk off, looking from one girl to another, until I finally came. I’d make this last as long as possible, going slowly when I was close and then picking up speed again at the end. I could go for ages. 

What somehow escaped my attention was that the living room light silhouetted me through the curtains and projected my jerking off to the entire neighborhood, like a lighthouse warning families to keep their daughters away. I did this for years without realizing that everyone knew exactly what I was doing. No wonder the neighbors avoided us. 

LT;DR: TIFU by projecting myself masturbating to the whole neighborhood, like the Batsignal of a lonely virgin.

3jcrqz,non_TBI,"So, my wife met an old friend of hers a few days ago and decided to invite her over with her husband for a dinner. We recently moved to a new apartament and I guess wifey wanted to show off how nice of a kitchen we have. I had a vague memory of who that friend is and I remember I didn't like her too much - let's call her X for this story.

Anyway, we prepared an oriental meal together for them (we like oriental food and it's what we usually cook for our guests too). X arrived with her husband soon after and we all sat for the dinner.

It wasn't going that bad at first; I made them laugh with a few jokes and we had a pleasant conversation. Suddenly, X pulled out a hair out of her chicken strip. It was long and she looked at it with disgust. My wife turned all red and started to frantically apologize while X looked at us with that face of disgust and contempt (she's a bit of a b*tch and clearly a false woman, I really have no idea why my wife is friends with her).

I wanted to save the day somehow; my thoughts were racing and without any second thought, I spilled the ""joke"" out of my mouth:

""Ya know it could've be worse, could've been a pube""

All of a sudden (I have no idea why), X puked all over her place at the table. She tried to cover her mouth with her hands but it didn't help too much. My wife was looking at me with eyes wide open. X let out some inhuman sounds and furiously walked towards the door, slamming them. Her husband gave us a quick look, muttered ""sorry"" and rushed after her, collecting her shoes from the corridor. My wife only said ""really? REALLY?"" and closed herself in the bathroom. I think she's taking a bath. I cleaned up all the mess but she still didn't leave the bathroom. 

**UPDATE:** I think the things settled down a bit. My wife said I'm the dumbest man ever but she still loves me.

**UPDATE 2:** X' husband texted us saying he's sorry for the mess. According to my wife, X didn't contact her yet. I hope it'll remain that way."
3eknwb,non_TBI,"For the past few months I haven't had sex or hooked up with anyone and I haven't even pleasured myself, but last night I went home with this smoking hot guy and I had one thing on my mind: I was ready to end that 2 month streak.  We are on the couch and things start getting steamy so I suggest we take it to his room.  We are on the bed, our clothes are coming off and this guy is turning me on like an Electrolux oven. As soon as he has his fingers inside of me it's like a juice box ruptured down there.  His eyes are wide with surprise, so I think; he hasn't encountered many like this (if any).  He slip and slides it in and he starts giving it to me good and my lady liquid just keeps flowing!  I can feel it running down my legs, my crack, up my back.  I am trying to enjoy this but I am starting to feel a little self-conscious because this guy's face is showing concern. He flips me on top and I go for a ride but this just makes the whole thing worse.  I can feel that his torso is literally drenched in my cum. It's all both of us now.  By the time he finished there was a puddle in the middle of the bed the length of my torso and double the width. We took the sheets off of the bed and the mattress was soaked too.  Now I have been known to get really wet.  My ex used to juice my lady parts on a regular basis and he loved every minute of if.  But I *never* squirted this much with the ex and this guy didn't seem to be all that into it. In fact he seemed a little frightened by it. And then I learned why.  As I rolled away and chuckled, nervously apologetic, he say, ""I hope *Dustin* doesn't kill me.""  We were in his roommate's bed apparently because his cousin was asleep in his.  Then I was mortified.  I got dressed and left immediately.  Sorry Dustin."
2ybnt3,non_TBI,"So this happened yesterday but I couldn't post it as it was not the weekend. 

I put up my phone for sell on a local classified app because I upgraded and wanted a little cash to justify the cost of my new phone. It was up for a week or so and got a few dead end replies, until yesterday. I got a email from someone who seemed very interested in the phone. They set up a time to come by and take a look and see if the phone worked on the network they had, witch is a good practice when buying a used phone! 

So around 4pm I hear a knock on my front door, I grab the phone and run to the door. I open it to find a girl and her dad (smart move for bringing your dad!) He proceeded to tell me his 15 year old daughter broke her phone and she saved up for months to buy a new one and he was happy I was giving her a good deal!. 

They checked over the phone made sure it worked and cash was handed to me. I closed the door feeling a sign of relief that I had made back a little of my new upgrade and felt it was well justified!. 

Fast forward and hour later I get an email from her dad wanted to give me a call to talk about something. I was worried they had encountered an issue with the phone so I agreed. He gives me a call and says 

Dad ""Hey uh...I wanted to let you know I came across some nude photos on the phone you sold me!""

At the moment I remembered I forgot to factory reset the device before I sold it! I thought this was the end, I thought I was going to jail for exposing this 15 year old girl to such filth!

Me ""OH NO! IM SO SORRY, I FORGOT TO CLEAN THE PHONE! 
dad "" yeah I uh...kinds figured the was the case, I wanted to call you to see if you wanted these pictures back?""
Me ""um......no you can just delete them, so your not mad?""
Dad ""why would I be? Its not the first time this has happened with something we have bought used. This is why I check through the device before giving it to my daughter. I called you to make sure the pictures weren't important and to remind you to factory rest your phone next time""

I told him how awesome of a parent he was and then slowly laid my head down on my desk and took a deep breath. Holy shit!

TL;DR sold my used phone to a 15 year old girl that had nudes on it, dad turned out to be awesome about it.

2dst5v,non_TBI,"Background info:  I've done martial arts since I was a kid.  My husband appreciates that and we play-wrestle sometimes for kicks and giggles.  Well, the other day hubby was standing in the bedroom by the dresser watching the news, so I thought that I'd stroll up and lightly tap/kick his stomach and initiate some fun times.  Except I was wearing a pair of skinny jeans, didn't get my leg up high enough and I ended up kicking him in the balls.  Also, I snapped the kick at the end from pure muscle memory.

The poor guy dropped to the ground and was in a fetal position for several minutes, just looking up at me like ""wtf, wife?!"".  I feel horrible.  =(

3n81mg,non_TBI,"So this happened yesterday, I'm still trying to process it. I was at the library at my campus, and I was putting the finishing touches on a lab report for my Organic Chemistry class. As soon as I get ready to leave, this guy from the same program comes to sit next to me. A little background info...

This guy has made it a point to sit right next to me everywhere, even when I'm clearly trying to isolate myself. He asked me for my number, and texts me afterwards everytime saying it was good to see me, even though we hardly talked. He then goes on to flirt blatantly with me, I'm a male by the way, and I kindly try to steer him away to no avail.

So back to the story, he sees my finished report on the computer screen, and asks if I'd mind looking over his when he finishes. I say sure, because it's just glancing over and assessing something, no biggie. I tell him my email so he can send it to me. I say goodbye, and go to my next class. After class I check my email, and I see 5 messages. All from him. They all have a title talking about the lab report, so I open the first one I see. There's an image attached, which is weird, it should be a pdf. But I say whatever, maybe he just elected to take a picture of it and send it instead of the file. There's no thumbnail on the picture, so going in blind I open it... To see a picture of his genitals. I'm afraid to open the other emails, and I don't think I'm going to be replying to his texts anymore.



Edit: Update! 
Thanks to you guys I sent him an email, and waited to get a response before updating. Even though what he did is clearly too far, I wanted to give him a chance before potentially devastating him with a report of the incident. 

So I emailed him saying that what he did is clearly harassment, and that I am not interested in his advances. I said I don't wish to cause him harm, but if he continues with his advances I'm afraid I will have to report him for harassment. Yes, I know, it's appropriate to report him right away. If he stops after this though, I don't need to ruin his life over it. 

So I get a reply back pretty quickly. It was readily apparent he didn't think of the consequences of sending such a thing (literally) over a school email of all things, and he began to apologize profusely. He apologized for not coming to terms and respecting the fact that I am not interested, and claims he will leave me alone from now on, realizing I will report him otherwise. Hopefully this is resolved. If not, I'll update! 

Edit: Tl;dr I emailed him saying I am not interested and to stop his advances, or I will go through with reporting the incident. He replied understanding the implications, apologizing, and claiming to stop all advances. "
3f21g0,non_TBI,"Since so many people asked for updates, I wanted to appease the masses with an update to this thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3ex772/tifu_on_a_job_interview_that_went_well_until_the/:

The resume, which was now in the garbage in 8 pieces, could easily be reconstructed to find the candidate's email address.  I then typed up this email:

> Dear [Name],

> Thank you again for your interest in [company].  During the latter stages of our interview, there may have been an event that could have been perceived as a negative reaction on my part.  Any such misconception is regrettable, and so I wanted to connect with you to clear up any misconceptions.  In fact, in our company's 7-category scoring metric for interviewed candidates, I even scored you as ""fairly competitive"".  Best wishes here or elsewhere in this exciting stage of your employment search journey.

>Best,
>[name]

Next, I copied and pasted the email to Reddit and deleted it since actually sending it would cause many Redditor's heads to literally explode, and furthermore the candidate might respond by returning with a new resume and stapling it to my warm misunderstood heart.

Finally I went up to the hiring manager and we discussed the various candidates. As there were several that were essentially equally qualified and also several positions open, a gentle nudge in her direction was enough to get the woman hired.  (And there was much rejoicing.  Yay...)

ADMISSION 1:  This was never quite as dramatic or tragic a story as it might have seemed, as the position is for a part-time adjunct professor.  Since usually they will teach classes at 2 or 3 colleges each semester, getting or not getting a job from one college is probably not the end of the world.  Of course, my original action was always a horrible gaffe that needed correction!  But since we were able to get her hired and since I'll see her shortly, I'm not going to awkwardly reach out now but instead laugh it off together when the time comes.  

ADMISSION 2:  Through much of the first thread, I felt like a wealthy land owner during the Communist purges, with the furor of the working class proletariat really rising up at me:  It was something to behold, although I seemed to quickly develop a Stalin-like ability to dismiss negative feedback at will (ah, but never to downvote it!)
   
Tl,dr:  She was hired :)

2ik223,non_TBI,"Reddit..TIFU

Yesterday morning started out like any other Monday. Getting to work around 8am, I grabbed a cup of coffee and started going through the emails from the weekend. 

I have this co-worker in the cubicle next to me who is sometimes quite obnoxious. I've occasionally had to tell her to quiet down when I was in the middle of a call because I couldn't hear the person on the other end.

Well, yesterday morning when I was in the middle of a call, the same thing happened. She was making all of these strange, loud noises, and I couldn't make out what the person on the other end of my phone was trying to say. So I yelled over the cubicle, 'Hey, can you please be a bit more quiet, I'm on the phone!' The noises didn't stop. So I was like wtf, I put my call on hold, and walked around to her cubicle to see why she couldn't stfu. 

Reddit...she was having a seizure and I yelled at her. I immediately called 911 and ran to alert my boss. Apparently she is mildly epileptic and she has seizures occasionally. She understood why I yelled at her, but I still feel horrible about it.

TL;DR TIFU by yelling at a girl who was having a seizure and not just being loud for no reason."
45c8qx,non_TBI,"My son has been in college since last fall. Last November, my 16 year old stepdaughter brought up allegations that my son had abused her repeatedly for several years. I confronted my son and he categorically denied it. But I knew that even though he was my son, I could not defend him for such an awful act.

My wife and I reported him to the authorities. My son was arrested in December and held in prison for a several weeks because I refused to provide him bail money. He was eventually expelled from his Ivy League college.

In the middle of January, my stepdaughter broke down and admitted she lied about everything. She had actually been having sex with her boyfriend and was scared the news would reach us.

The charges were dismissed and my son was released immediately but the damage was done. His first girlfriend from college ended things with him. The news spread about the allegations and all his childhood friends have decided to just stay away from him even though I called each and every one of them personally.

I have called the school and explained the situation and even though they sympathized, they said he needed to reapply for the next school year and go through the admissions process again. 

My son is understandably furious at us. He has moved back home and refuses to talk to me at all. Both my wife and I have apologized to him repeatedly. We have banned my stepdaughter from our home permanently and she has been sent to live with her father in another state. My wife and I also agreed to completely disinherit her from our wills. It has been a very painful situation. All of us started therapy.

The realization of how badly I ruined my son’s life hit me when I picked up his first prescription of anti-depressants today. I bawled my eyes out in my car.

He is the pride and joy of my life. He is outgoing, funny, intelligent and the kindest person I know. But when I handed him his medication, I could not even recognize him. He locks himself in his room, does not eat properly and has lost several pounds so far. 

Whenever I try talking to him, I just see the hate he has for me in his eyes. I don’t know if I can ever get him to love me again.

I know he is on Reddit very often. T, if you are reading, I want to tell you again how sorry your stepmom and I are. I promise I will get you into college again. I know I can’t get you back the year you lost. But I will do everything in my power to make this right. Everything I have has always been for you. I hope you will give me a chance to fix this. I love you so much it hurts. I failed as a father and I hope one day you will forgive me.

TL;DR I played a part in getting my own son getting falsely arrested and expelled"
2j6apb,non_TBI,"I’m a teenage girl and my boyfriend spends a lot of time at our house. My parents are fine with it. 

My family has a pretty large lot, and the back corner of the lot has a little group of trees and a hammock. It’s very secluded. 

I was relaxing in the hammock a few days ago when my boyfriend found me and decided to join me. One thing led to another and we started fooling around a little bit.

Then, the hammock decided it wasn’t having any more of our shit. 
It gave out and we slammed into the ground. Hard.

The shocked noises and the sound of the hammock hitting the ground are enough to make my mom come running. My brother and sister followed.

And what do they find?

They find a 17-year-old girl in a turquoise bra and panties attempting to disentangle herself one-handed from the mildly concussed boxer-clad 18-year-old boy lying on top of her. 

My mom jumps into action, because first aid is practically a job requirement when you have 9 kids.

By the time we get inside, our audience includes three of my brothers, my sister, my brother’s girlfriend, and my sister-in-law. All of whom are trying extremely hard not to laugh hysterically in front of my mother. 

In the end, my eldest brother had to take me to the hospital while my mom monitored my boyfriend for signs of imminent brain damage. 

Two days later:

*  I’m wearing a massive neon cast on my left arm.
*  My siblings have only recently stopped giggling every time one of us enters the room.
*  Two of my older brothers have made a jokes about giving my boyfriend another concussion if he didn’t keep his hands to himself.
*  My older sister has offered to take me bra shopping.
* The story (in explicit detail) has been relayed to three different family members.
* I've had to give my younger brother $10 to keep him from telling anyone at school.
* Multiple jokes have been made about how my boyfriend can't afford to suffer any more brain damage. 
* Far too many of my immediate family members have wiggled their eyebrows suggestively at us.
* My mom is still obsessively monitoring my boyfriend’s mental state.
* My dad has asked us if we needed another talk about “safe sex.”

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I broke a hammock during sexy times. Entire family thinks it's hilarious. 

**Edit1:** It's awesome to hear about all of the people with big families on here! There should be a sub for that! 

**Edit2:** Holy crap, gold! Thank you to /u/SteveSnitzelson and two other users! I will pay it forward.

**Edit3:** If anyone is interested, I made a sub /r/hugefamilies because a ton of people commented saying they had large families as well. Parents, siblings, people with large extended families, whatever.  
"
2niypv,non_TBI,"So I'm prone to having a medical event called Vasovagal syncope. In a nutshell, it means that my Vagus nerve is retarded (literally-people who have this condition from adolescence lose it as they age): 

When it senses a decline in blood pressure, instead of increasing my heart rate and constricting my blood vessels it does the exact opposite. This feeds back on itself until my blood vessels are so dilated and my heart rate is so slow that I pass out. Then my reflexes decides to play nice and correct itself. I'm in my early 20s and I've had less than a half dozen of these episodes. They've only occurred when I was drinking heavily or was having blood drawn.

Today, I went to my primary care physician and I had to have blood drawn. I had an afternoon appointment and fasted through breakfast so I hadn't eaten or drank anything in 16 hours.

Right after I had my blood drawn, I had the worst Vasovagal episode of my life. I could feel myself burning up, sweating profusely, and going into bradycardia. I did what I was taught to do during an episode: I got out of the chair, laid down on my back on the floor using my arms as pillows, and put my feet up on the chair to optimize perfusion to my brain.

The lab technician called a code and several nurses came, followed by office workers for reasons unbeknown to me at the time. The last thing I saw before I passed was my spread out legs on the chair, and my third leg pressing through my sweatpants in between.

I woke up outside the clinic. A nurse practitioner told me the following had happened:

After I passed out, she had taken my blood pressure and was unable to. She then took my pulse and couldn't find one. For a while, I was clinically dead and sprawled on the ground with an erection (note: during a Vasovagal episode, I experience vasodilation throughout my body).

Meanwhile, the clinic had some sort of ventilation malfunction and there was smoke coming out of the vents (the office workers had come to the lab to inform us). The fire department had been called earlier and they arrived (the firehouse is across the street) and evacuated the clinic.

The nurses couldn't move me so the firefighters had to carry me out. I hope they didn't have to use a fireman's carry (the lab space was too small to fit a stretcher). 

.
.
TL;DR: My body decided to make my heart stop and my blood pool in my penis at an unfortunate time and place. I took no precautions even though similar occurrences have occurred in the past. Awkwardness ensues.

Edit: I just remembered this and want to share: For anyone wondering what dying (and possible brain cell loss) feels like... it's like an orgasm that's 3 times as pleasurable as your best one, seems to lasts for minutes (a long time for a guy), and concludes with your vision fading to black from outside in. I thought I was ejaculating and that's why I looked down before I passed.

3sjhwd,non_TBI,"I'm a daily train commuter and ride in/out of the city with the missus 90% of the time. Today she worked from home and the empty seat next to me was eventually taken by a stranger; a dude who happened to be one of those suit-wearing leg-spreaders who thinks its ok to be slightly-but-constantly touching/grazing his neighbor in order to accommodate his gape (and while I’m completely within the confines of my own seat’s space). Some people can tolerate and block out that kind of annoyance but I'm not one of them, though I'm also not so assertive that I'd want to inject a ""stop touching me"" debate into a full-yet-nearly-silent train car. So I'm sitting there, trying to nod off and not think about it, but it's pretty much impossible. I put on some relaxing music -- didn't help. I'm starting to seethe, internally, and even though it's not like the guy was Cosby'ing me, the fact that his touching kept me from fading into a nap was driving me further and further into madness.  
  
Suddenly it occurred to me that on an almost-daily basis I'm rubbing up against the person sitting next to me, and so I just needed to think to myself that this person is simply my wife and to not focus on who it really is. ""It's Kathy. It's Kathy. It's Kathy"", I kept telling myself, and it actually started to work. I was finally starting to doze off, feeling that lovely, almost-meditative blankness begin to wash over me, perhaps aided in part by Mr. Miles Davis. I then suddenly awoke to the most aggressive shoulder shrug and opened my eyes to find suit dude looking at me with scornful disgust, and I immediately realized what had happened: Once the self-imposed “It’s Kathy” brainwashing reached the point of optimal coalescence with the process of falling asleep, autopilot kicked in and I took a deep, contented sigh-like breath and nuzzled my head into the man’s shoulder, not unlike the way a needy dog rubs its head against your hand, in seek of loving pats.  
  
‘Sorry’ was said and faces were red, and so began my day.  
  
TL;DR - Was dealing with leg-to-leg touching from a dude sitting next to me on the train this morning. Kept telling myself it was 'just my wife' as I tried to not think about it and nod off. Wound up falling asleep and lovingly leaning into his shoulder.

39ke5u,non_TBI,"I picked up my 4 year old daughter at daycare yesterday. They have some playground equipment outside the building where the kids play. Almost every time I pick my daughter up, she runs to get a few more slides and climbs in before we drive home. 

I decided to kill a few minutes and check my facebook out while her and some boy were playing by some fake wooden train. This guy I barely know on facebook, had a video titled ""how to embarass someone in 6 seconds"". The main picture of the video was some guy looking at a boot on his car. Looked like it might be funny, so I clicked it.......

BAM! Its a damn trick video that was playing the sounds of some woman moaning during sex. Worse: My phone is on full blast.  The phone is so loud , the kids stop in a frantic and give me this ""WTF is going on"" look.

I quickly try to stop the video but I guess the shock of it all stunned me.. Took me a full 5 seconds to stop it.  Not sure who all heard it, but I got out of there pretty fast.....

Hope they dont call the cops and get me on some list....

TL;DR Some dude had a gag video on facebook. I played it at my daughters kindie.

EDIT : 1) I'm living in a foreign country. School years/ages/subjects don't line up well. Its basically like a kindergarten.. but its  daycare..... sorry for the confusion 2)Also, I went back today.. No one said anything.. So I guess its all good.. 3) I had my volume all the way up because I use my Iphone/youtube as a radio.. 4) No I didn't deserve that crap. Its my daughters school. It has to be one of the worst places it could have happened....

EDIT : 2) Thanks for the reddit gold! Also, I guess 2 days later.. I feel a bit better about the whole situation.. It looks like this really wasn't a unique experience and lots of people have experienced this. 2) I know my grammar is horrible, MY BAD DOGS. 3) ""I live in a foreign country"" --- I'm an American living abroad... is it really that weird to say that? I dunno. Anyway, thanks for listening guys..  This thread has run its course.

2hi9w4,non_TBI,"So I am inspired by someone else's TIFU about giving a homeless man money. I too have a story from a couple years back where I FU'd.

I was in college and it was my junior year. I owned this really cool car that I had purchased in cash but in order to get the cash, I borrowed part of the money from family friends. Every month I would pay back some of the loaned money (about 200/mo) and, per the rules of the contract, I would bring that money in cash and visit with them.

So one afternoon when I didn't have class, I went to go run some errands and pay off these fine folks. I needed gas so I went to a gas station to fill up. I saw a beggar next to the entrance of the convenience store and I thought it would be good to get him something to eat and drink. So while my car is filling up, I go inside and purchase a coke and sandwich. When I exit the convenience store to bring the food to the guy, he's gone. I looked around but he had left. A little disappointed, I get in my car and toss the grocery bag into the passenger seat. I figured I could give it to someone else.

I had some extra money from working and figured I would give these family friends two car payments. So I withdrew $500 which was enough for two car payments and some extra cash for...stuff that has to be paid for in cash. That cash was given to me by the bank in a white envelope. I tossed the envelope into the passenger seat next to me.

So I pull up to an intersection and perfect! another homeless beggar. So I honk my horn and he comes over to my car. My light turns green so I tell him God Bless and hand him the lunch and go on my way. I glance over at the passenger seat and realizes the money is gone and perfectly timed! I look into my side view mirror to see the guy pulling the envelope out of the grocery bag. I had tossed the envelope into the lunch bag.

So I quickly U-turn and park my car across from the intersection and run over to him. He's already counting the money, sees me, and starts running. So here I am chasing a homeless man for money and yelling at him. I feel terrible but I've got to have that money so I chase him for a couple blocks and finally tackle him in the median of another intersection. So people are getting out of their cars and shit and trying to see what is going on and I'm on top of this old man saying, ""Give me my money! I didn't mean to give it to you!"" and he starts crying.

So then all these people start pulling me off of him and the homeless guy is saying I gave him money and then changed my mind. I look like a total dick but I try explaining my situation and this woman is calling the police but I see my envelope in the guy's hand and so I quickly grabbed it. Some guy tried to grab hold of me but I kind of sort of hit him and ran. I ran like hell back to my car and took off but it just looked like I had just assaulted people.

I ended up driving around for an hour to get my wits and go to pay off my car. I never heard from the police. "
1ylam9,non_TBI,"When I take a dump I always have some toilet paper in my hand folded up, or sitting on my leg, or the ledge of the bathtub.   

My wife always walks in on me when I'm in there, and over the years I've developed this strange joke thing where I'll stuff the toilet paper into my mouth when she walks in. I don't know why I do it, but she laughed at it years ago so I've just kept it up. The toilet paper is always clean when I do that.  

She never walks in when I'm wiping, and if she does, I would hear here coming and not wipe while she's there, I could never bring myself to wipe in front of her for some reason. 

Well, tonight I was wiping, and of course I looked at what I wiped, and the door swung open. I didn't miss a beat, I stuffed the shit covered toilet paper right into my mouth. This wasn't a 3rd-5th wipe buildup, this was number 1, the very first wipe, the one with the most shit per square inch. This wasn't a normally formed shit either, it was runny, chunky, loose, and for fucks sake it smelled horrid. 

As soon as it touched my tongue, I gagged, I gagged worse then I've ever gagged before. Then I puked. 

All the while my wife is just standing there laughing hysterically, practically peeing her pants. Thankfully the kids were down in the basement, I didn't want them hearing or seeing what just happened. 

I calmed down, she calmed down, she left the washroom. I got up and rinsed my mouth out several times, brushed my teeth, and used several mouthfuls of scope, all the while my ass is covered in shit and there's puke on the floor. I threw the toothbrush away, finished wiping then I cleaned up the puke. 

Never again.

2yzr25,non_TBI,"This was around last week, but anyways, a bit of back story. I am a high school student at an all-boys school. Even so, we have a few female teachers, my french teacher being one of them. I'm not the most popular kid. I'm that kind of guy who doesn't say anything so that people don't hate me if I say something stupid. Because of that, I am always quiet and respectful in her class, which is filled with jackasses, so she really liked me. 

Anyways, I was doing some work while the teacher had been helping others who needed it. My nose was running like a bitch, and so I had to keep getting up to get tissues. At one point, she was bent over helping a group of students with some work when I went to grab a tissue. I tend to sway my arms really hard when I walk, just habit, really. While I wasn't paying attention, one of my hands flew towards her and slapped her ass really hard.

She instantly stood up and screamed ""EXCUSE ME?!?!?"". She turned around and saw that I was the one who did it. She instantly calmed down a little and allowed me to explain myself because she liked me and knew that wasn't what I would normally do, but my social skills are so bad that I wasn't sure where to start or how to explain it. So I stood there babbling quickly while everyone else was laughing their asses off. We used to talk after school, but now all conversations are plain awkward. I'm seen as the god of the class now, but that isn't the attention I want.

**TL;DR Got up to get a tissue, accidentally slapped her ass. We're super awkward now.**"
2gjk2r,non_TBI,"Firstly I have never been in a relationship so a mate told me to start using tinder. I'm not a model, I'm just an average college guy looking for some girls to hang with so when I got matched with a few really pretty girls I was very happy.

So this all started around 2 months ago I started talking to a girl let's call her Ella, she was very pretty and we had a lot in common we went out 6 times we had fun and nothing was official. A month a go I got matched with another very pretty girl but at this point I was really starting to like ella but this girl let's call her Emily sent me two messages so being the nice guy I was I sent her a message back after a couple weeks of talking to Emily she wanted to get some drinks I thought what the hell I don't think Ella is really that into me anyway. Little did I know that I received a text from ella in the middle of the date I had with Emily asking if I was interested in becoming a little more serious (I was and she was one of the nicest and most interesting girls I had ever talked to). 


So at this point I had two girls that where in to me, being a 20 year old nerdy virgin that sits on reddit all day I was stoked. After a few drinks Emily asked if I wanted to go back to her place, shit I panicked I wasn't expecting this I had no Condoms and was freaking the fuck out I said let's get one more round during this I rushed to the bathroom hoping they had those baby prevention machines that spit out condoms for a buck. Yes, they did I bought 5 I was that excited and who knows I might break one or something.


So I finish my drink and we start walking back to her place, a little bit tipsy I start talking dirty but luckily she's totally into it. We start walking up the stairs to her place and before she opens the door she says ""shhh *giggles* my room mates a huge nerd and is probably in bed"". So we get inside I try to take my shoes off and just my fucking luck my fat ass hits the small fish bowl next to the front door... Who the fuck puts a glass fish bowl next to the front door. Smash! Water every where she starts freaking out and I try to pick up the glass. But we both just start laughing.


Then I hear my Name ""Mick, what are you doing here"" totally confused half drunk and thinking that Emily was just playing with me I rambled ""to fuck you obviously"" I look up and turns out Emily and Ella are room mates and poor old Mick is still a virgin.


TL;DR: Virgin, started using tinder. Had two girls that turned out to be room mates. Still a Virgin.

3wzfk3,non_TBI,"Being a college freshman I've been mercilessly studying for finals trying to cram as much information as I can. Now usually I don't believe in performance enhancing drugs but feeling overwhelmed I decide that the best possible solution to get the most studying is to pop an adderall first thing the next morning.  My roommate as an assortment of perscription drugs in his dresser and he says I could have one. After some late night studying I hope into bed at around 2am. I wake up at 7, stumble out of bed half asleep, grab a pill from his dresser, and grab some breakfast. I start eating waiting for the drugs to kick in, expecting to feel something. About halfway into my egg sandwich, i start to feel it. Unfortunately it wasn't hawk like focus you would imagine getting in an adderall. No it was more like the largest boner I ever had in my life. Then it hits me... 



*oh fuck I took one of my roommate's viagra.*



I don't know why my roommate has viagra but it sure does work. Try studying for finals not being able to focus **and** with a four hour erection



TL;DR Tried studying for finals, ended being the hardest day of my life.

Edit: My roommate told me they were the pills loose in his drawer, me not knowing what the difference in pills were just took the first one I grabbed, yes I'm stupid, I get it. Also it deflated on its own in four hours, if it lasted any longer I would have called a doctor.

Edit 2: Wow first front page thanks! You can call this story ""bullshit"" or ""fake"" all you want but my dick begs to differ."
3ljmrm,non_TBI,"This happened about a year ago when I was 17. I was home alone, and did what any teenager does when they have five minutes to themselves, I began to watch porn and masturbate. All was well and good for ten minutes, until I heard someone coming up the stairs through my headphones. I realised it must have been my dad coming home from work and I didn't hear him open the front door. Trouble was, my door was slightly open, so I convinced myself to get up and shut it. I was also close to orgasm at this point, and it is very hard to stop that feeling once it has arisen.

Anyway, my dad is coming up the stairs and I rush from my bed to close my door, yet my climax had already begun, and I could feel the orgasm. He had reached the top of the stairs and came to my room. I couldn't shut my door in time and there he was, bursting into my room coming face to face with me, stark naked and holding my erect penis as it shoots out cum which unfortunately landed on his trousers. I immediately slammed my door feeling absolutely horrified. I got dressed real quick and didn't speak to him for a few days. Definitely the worst possible thing I could imagine to do to one of my parents.


EDIT: My dad was probably going to check if I was studying, after this ""incident"" my parents always knocked before coming in. But the days following this I didn't make eye contact with my dad, until he finally said it was ""embarrassing for both of us"" I don't think he told my mum, but each time I look at my dad I can't help but thinking ""you were the first person I shared my 'love' with""


TL;DR: Didn't hear my dad coming until the last minute. Turned out I then accidentally cummed on him."
3o88zi,non_TBI,"So, I have an old iPhone 5 with a broken mic and home button and I had the last week of AppleCare service so I wanted to get it fixed before selling it on eBay. My mom really wanted to check out the new Apple Store that just opened in my town, so I brought her with me. We went to the Genius Bar, and I explained the problem. He was ready to replace it when my mom told the guy""My son is obsessed with electronics, he repaired that iPhone's screen six months ago by himself"". *insert biggest facepalm ever here*
Not only he didn't replace my phone, but now my warranty is long gone and I can't get it fixed by Apple even by paying them.

2mibw9,non_TBI,"So for the past few years, because of my job, I've maintained a beard and long hair so as to kind of not have people immediately peg me for a soldier/cop. Well, I took a promotion recently, and it had been suggested that I lose the beard and start looking like someone important. 

Well, today, before I left for work, I called the girl at the barbershop I usually go to to see if she could do me a solid. I asked if there was any way she could meet me at the shop to cut my hair and beard. Seeing as we have a pretty long, solid relationship, she agreed. I got to the shop, and she had a glass of my preferred bourbon waiting for me, and we went back for my cut and shave. We talked, and she asked if my better half had asked me to do this, and I told her I hadn't talked to her about it yet. We'll get back to that in a second. She cleaned up, I paid her and gave her a 100% tip, as my way of saying ""thanks for coming in on short notice on a Sunday, when I know you'd rather be home with your husband,"" and then I was on my way.

When I got home, I jumped in the shower, and threw on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Apparently, however, while I was upstairs in the shower, my better half had gotten home (I wasn't expecting her back from her most recent leg of flights until Wednesday). When I came downstairs, my dog Diesel was laying across her lap on the couch, with her back to me. I leaned over the back of the couch and kissed her neck. Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but with the lack of beard hair, she wasn't used to feeling my actual face.

I'm sure y'all can guess what happened next, more or less. If not, I'll sum it up. She screamed, tried to jump up, which prompted Diesel (all 120 pounds of him) to go into defense mode because now mommy is upset. Being the good boy he is, and knowing full well I'm the alpha in the house, he became confused, and stood there as she was trying to get off the couch. She tripped over him, fell on her back in the middle of the living room, as I was moving around the couch to try and calm her down.

""Babe! It's me! It's ok! It's OOOOMF!!!!""

It was at that point that I regretted taking her to my MMA gym. I took a snap kick right in my bean bag. I went down like a cheap hooker in Vegas, and it was only when Diesel didn't lunge to rip out my throat that she realized the junk she just assaulted belonged to her boyfriend. Now instead of showing genuine concern, she started laughing hysterically, saying how I look so young, and calling me babyface as I limped to the kitchen to grab an icepack for my balls.


TL;DR - I didn't warn my girlfriend that I was shaving my beard and cutting my hair, and she didn't recognize me since she'd only known me with long hair and a beard. As a result, I got kicked right in the mommy daddy button.

Super TL;DR - Took away the tickle, so I took a kickle right in the pickle."
3sczw8,non_TBI,"Ok, this happened years ago. If this is against the rules, I apologize. But I saw the post about the restaurant employee who told about telling off a rude customer and figured i'd share my tale.

Let me start out by saying I have manic depression and anxiety. Not self diagnosed, actual doctor diagnosed.  And for those who are fortunate enough to have neither, don't pretend you do. No sane person would want this.

During my collage years, I worked full time at McDonalds. A fate worse than death for me. I'm real nervous and tense all the time. I'd describe it was always having a feeling something awful is about to happen but it never does.

I would have starved to death if it wasn't for left over McDonalds which still makes me sick thinking of the smell. For the most part, I stayed in back. But there were times when I was in the front lines. I'm not suppose to work at Restaurants. It's on file on my therapist that I can't do work relating to social interaction. But files don't pay for college nor feed me.

There was this bitch who came in 2-3 times a month. Maybe more. She would always complain about her food. You could just cook her food and bring it to her. She'd bring it back half eaten and claim it was cold. Management always gave her free food just to get rid of her. That only encouraged her antics.

Well, I graduated college and was set to move back home. I was gonna put my two weeks notice in a few days later when it happened.

Someone didn't show up and I was stuck on the front lines. For the most part, people were decent. They wouldn't mind me looking at the counter or my stutter(which goes away when im pissed, which comes into play). 

4:30. Here she comes with two kids. My heart drops seeing her. I heard co-workers complain about her but this was my first and last time dealing with her. ""Maybe she's not as bad as they say"" I think. First fucking thing ""Hey! Look me in the eyes when I talk to you"". Sorry I can't help it.

She orders a ton of food. It was the worst experience. I have a habit of asking to confirm. ""4 medium orders of fries mam?"" ""That's exactly what I said. Can you hear?"". I prayed for a co-worker who knew me to help but it never happened.

I got it over with. She went to her table. She came and got her food. Sure enough, 20 minutes later, here she was. ""Um, my fries and my kid's fries were cold. Can I get some actual fresh ones?"". Of course, that didn't stop them from eating it all. 

But i comply. I tell one of my co-workers I am going to snap. He gives me a look of compassion. I watched them come out of the grease. I give them to her. She says something rude like ""about time"" and leaves.

Then she comes back in. ""Hey! These fries are cold too? I think I said I wanted warm and fresh fries"". I try to tell her that I saw them cooked myself but I was stuttering. Then she crossed the line. ""uh, uh,uh,uh. Stop stuttering. No wonder you can't get my fucking food made right"". That pissed me off. 

I snap. My co-worked heard this and fixed her 4 orders of fries again. That's 12 orders of fries they made for her and her kids. I grab the tray and sit it down. She's aruging with her kids. Without looking at the counter. She asks ""Are they done? I'm in a hurry!"". 

Instincts kick in and I grab two of the boxs of fries(back then, only the large came in the red boxes). She turned to me and I threw them at her. One box hit her right between the eyes. ""Here's your fucking fries, you fat bitch!"" I yell and immediately storm out of the restaurant, drowning out everything said to me.

I never went back. I never returned the uniform. I never got my last paycheck. I was panicked for a bit that I could be taken to court as that could be seen as assault. But nothing came.

But to be honest, doing that was worth more than anything that job had. The only regret I had was that I didn't throw all 4 orders of fries at her.

TL;DR Me, A manic depressive with anxiety gets picked on by a woman at McDonalds. Gets mad, throws box of fries at her and leaves."
2yb2vu,non_TBI,"so, this happened about 8 or 9 days ago, and this has really fucked up my head. i go on theync and liveleak and shit, so i thought i was pretty desensitized, but my buddy, let's call him...brock?(yeah, brock) proved that was a load of bull right there.

any who, he called me up asking me to look at his lappytop right? so i take it home and do. lots of porn viruses and the usual shit, so i clear it and clean it. then, like any good person i started looking through his history, his files, music all of that. 

then i find this series of folders in folders ""neat, something really embarrassing"" so i venture forth to stare into the abyss. oh god it stared back, and i blinked hard

inside this folder is a collection of really distressing videos. i watched a few and found out my buddy's a pedophile who downloads.....

i had a nervous breakdown a few days ago when a neighbors kid started crying on the sidewalk outside my house reminded me of one of the videos' audio. i haven't eaten in days and sleep is little and far between. i needed to say this somewhere before i go fucking mad

EDIT: i have reported him, he's been hauled off, but....i can't unsee that shit

additionally turns out it was over 14 gigs in his ""collection"" on seperate thumb drives, and this guy was in my home
the detective offered to let be evaluated by the department psychologist on the 11th"
2pryz5,non_TBI,"In order for this story to make sense, you must know that I am a slightly awkward caucasian male, and my girlfriend is african american.

My girlfriend and I are starting to get pretty serious, so she invited me to meet her parents and stay at their family home for part of the holidays. I was a bit nervous and reluctant at first, but ultimately accepted the invitation. What she failed to mention was that not only would her parents be there, but also her uncles, cousins, and grandparents. In all, there were about 15 people or so.

I arrived and immediately felt a bit out of place. However I managed to feign confidence and charisma and everything went smoothly for the first few hours. Things then seemed to take an step in the right direction when I was invited to partake in the annual tradition the men of the family had of playing a game of poker.

We decided to play for some money in order to keep things interesting. But instead of putting in actual cash, we gave each color chip a designated dollar value. After the chips had been passed out and the first hand was dealt, the first round of bidding occurred.

My girlfriend's father bid 2 black chips ($1 total) and in my turn I raised one white chip ($2.50 total). My girlfriend, who was looking on, asked the group, ""how much is a black one worth versus a white?""

Without thinking, I responded with, ""history would say three-fifths"".

The ensuing seconds were the longest of my life. I could feel my face turning bright red as I realized what I had just said. I looked to my girlfriend, who had turned away, struggling to contain her laughter at my situation.

The silence was finally broken when I then heard a raspy chuckle to my right. It was grandpa Willy, who hadn't said a word to me all day. He quickly escalated to a Stanley Hudson-esk laugh (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOvz8P3OZ0s) and soon enough, everyone at the table started laughing along as I sat there uncomfortably faking a smile and wishing I hadn't opened my stupid mouth.

tl;dr Thank god for grandpa willy"
2osmhf,non_TBI,"This occurred a few months ago, but I just discovered this Subreddit, so I figured it would still be relevant. 

For my English class, we were assigned one of ten projects about the book To Kill a Mockingbird. We were allowed to pick a partner and, without question, locked eyes with the girl who was at the time my best friend. We decided to make the project entitled ""Make a Board Game"". Needless to say, we were going to make a board game. 

I, who had never had an interaction with a girl outside of school, we wondering how to compose myself; should I just be myself? Sure, what could go wrong? We met at the library and got working on our project making sufficient progress and having fun all the while. She slides her chair close to me. Really close to me. She starts resting her arm on mine and being a little *too* cozy. 

Eventually she wraps her arms around me and gives me a hug, squeezing me quite a lot. I decide to do what she's doing and hug her, squeezing just as hard. Little did I know, I can squeeze a lot harder than a girl who's 5'2"" and 110 lbs. 

*CRACK* she jumps as if someone scared her. She complains that her side hurt and she is convinced she broke her rib, however, she shakes it off and keeps working. we finish, I go home and she texts me later saying ""So you actually broke my rib."" And later showed me the X-ray. She didn't hold it against me and actually we ended up dating, and still are to this day. And don't worry, neither if us have broken anything else.

TL;DR I was too awkward to know how to hug so I broke my friends rib. Now we're dating. Love hurts. "
2yooxb,non_TBI,"This happened just like 10 minutes ago, I'm still shaking and terrified to go downstairs.

Okay, so in the U.K it's Mother's Day on Sunday. 

Earlier I went to get my mum [a few chocolates etc.](http://i.imgur.com/9TQJgrA.jpg) to go with her presents, and as she was at work, I haven't wrapped them or anything, they were just on the side in my room.

My mum gets home like half an hour ago, and there's a knock on my bedroom door.

''Can I come in?''

I look at the presents, in clear view to anyone who walks through the door, and need to think of a reason to tell my mum to not come in without sounding suspicious...so what do I shout back?


''NO, DON'T COME IN MUM...I'M HAVING A WANK!''

&nbsp;

I'll now never be able to look my mum in the eyes again.


--------------------------

Edit: 

To everyone saying ''why not just say that your presents are in plain sight'' obviously that would have been better than what I did say, but when I decided to come up with an excuse I thought it would have been better than ''I'm having a wank''.

Also, thanks for the Gold "
41h8vb,non_TBI,"I was watching movies with my boyfriend after he had gotten off of a long day at work.  He fell asleep while watching the movie.  I decided that I would take this opportunity to be spontaneous and sexy for him.  I started undoing his belt and he did not stir at all.  I kept going, undoing his button and zipper.  He was out cold.  I decided that this seemed way more rapey that I was comfortable with.   After I undid his pants, I just left them.  In the middle of the movie, I decided to go get a glass of water and disappeared for a little bit.  My boyfriend happened to wake up in the two minutes I was gone.  He freaked out.  He thought he had proceeded to undo his pants in his sleep which led to even more questions of why and what happened.  I came back to him wide awake looking like he had committed a murder. 

tl;dr Boyfriend thought he scared me away by furiously jacking off in his sleep. 


edit: Well, shit.  Everyone is saying that it's not rape. I know. He was just really tired and I thought I'd let him sleep because clearly he was old cold. Dude woke up to some hot pizza instead. "
2gutt9,non_TBI,"This morning at the gas station a cute guy got out the car in front of us and I said 'ohhhh', my daughter looked up from her book and had the same reaction. I asked her if she could tell that he is gay and my son said that it was obvious. Jokingly I remarked that it would have been funny if my son had said ohhh as well.

My son is 14 years old and at his age insinuating that he might be gay is a big deal to him. His friend was in the car as well and I could see that my son was embarrassed by my comment so I tried to rectify it.  It just went downhill from there.

Without thinking I said 
'I'm kidding, I know you're not gay because I've seen your porn search history' 

His eyes widened and I should have stopped there but I just kept digging myself into a bigger hole.
‘I saw that you like big breasts, so you are clearly not gay’ 

My son cringed, so once again trying to fix it... 
‘Its ok sweetie, you don’t have to be embarrassed, everyone watches porn, even mommy has a porn stash’. 
By this point he was visibly upset and my last attempt to rescue the situation was 
‘Baby it’s fine, I will show you my porn’ 


By this point I realized that it would be better if I just kept quiet.
We drove the rest of the way in silence.

3o60y2,non_TBI,"So right now I'm a junior in high school but last Friday I asked a girl classmate  who I've crushed on since freshman year to be my girlfriend. She said yes, shoo be doo be doo to me.

Now, every day at lunch ever since last year we've just sat in the library and worked or talked or anything. So today was no different and we're just talking about our plans tonight or something.

All of a sudden, the talk redirects to something very interesting she says.

""Meinster, how long have you liked me?"" 

I was taken aback because I've liked this girl since day one for her beautiful looks, smarts, attitude, etc.

""Well I've been crushing mad on you since day one"" I said or something. But she wasn't satisfied and told me to tell her more, like my inner thoughts and whatnot.

Naturally, I say ""Well tbh after I followed you on Instagram I used to jack off to your bikini pics, that's how much I crushed on you."" to flatter her even more.

For some reason she turned red and looked at me in shock, then told me that we're no longer together and she just walked out of the library and to the cafeteria I guess.

...Bad mistake?

*Edit* Thanks for the comments. I'd go for a beer at the bar right now, but clearly I'm underage. Anyways, on Tuesday at school (Monday is Columbus Day) I'll try to salvage this. I'll update then."
2zyhd3,non_TBI," So I'm a 17 year old male, and I decided to visit a couple of colleges for my spring break. My grandparents both are really supportive of me, and they asked if they could take me. I don't get to spend much time with them, as they live out of town, so I figured it would be a good idea. I brought my stuff over Friday, and have just been chilling and playing Xbox all weekend. They have a fairly nice computer, and I had been wanting to see some gameplay of the new Battlefield, so  I hopped on the computer while they were in the den this morning . I launched chrome and began to type in the URL bar (Which neither of my grandparents know how to use, they just search things on Google) when some pornhub links popped up as suggested web addresses. Not expecting pornhub to come up, I was shocked at first. I ran the past couple of days through my head, making sure I hadn't been the careless person to not clear their history after letting loose some knuckle children. After confirming in my mind that it wasn't me, I decided to be a bro and clear my gramp's history for him. Wouldn't want my grandma finding it, that's for sure. So I clicked on history, and quickly found the source of the problem. I figured since I was already there, I might as well glance through it all to see what my grandpa was into. Needless to say, he was into some kinky shit. And I mean, wayyyyyy out there, even for me. Not wanting to scar my mind anymore than I already had, I just went ahead cleared everything and went about my business. Flash forward to about 15 minutes ago, and my grandma calls me into the room they keep their computer in. She was trying to log onto Facebook, and asked me why she wasn't logged in like she normally was. I, completely not thinking about the reasoning behind my actions, told her that it was probably because of me clearing the history. As soon as the words left my mouth, I wished I could have reached out and grabbed them back, fearful of the shitstorm I might have just started with my grandmother. She, as quick as a cobra striking it's prey, asked why in the world I would need to clear the history. At this point, I panicked, not wanting my grandfather's secret to be found out. I told her, very unconvincingly, that it was bogging down their computer. For Whatever reason, up to this point I never thought of the possibility of this being perceived as me covering my own ass. Sure as shit, she decided to put this on me, and tried to call me out looking at those ""dirty, dirty videos"" and gave me a speech about how ""God was watching"" and that ""Pornography is a one-way ticket to hell "". This all went in one ear and out the other, but it was still super awkward to hear from my 81 year old grandmother. After her talk, I left the room and ran into my grandpa in the kitchen. He simply looked me in the eye and nodded, having overheard the whole thing. I reciprocated said nod, and went about my buisness, now living with the fact that my grandpa is a porn fiend and my grandma thinks I'm one.

TL;DR - Took the blame for my grandpa's porn habit  by my grandma 

Edit - To all of you asking what the search history was, I'll just say fecal matter was involved.

Edit #2- Obligatory Thanks for the gold! Now to figure out what to do with it."
35hp1i,non_TBI,"I'm an 18 year old guy, and big surprise, I watch porn. However, today when I opened a downloaded video on my laptop whilst in my room, the screen was black with a flatscreen TV icon on the middle. So I skipped to about halfway through the clip to see if this would make it work, but then I heard fucking noises (literally) coming from the living room where my family, including my 10 year old brother, were previously watching Horton Hears a Who (fantastic family movie I know). Unfortunately however, this Dr Seuss flick was interrupted by a hardcore threesome porn clip, which my laptop was playing via the apple TV...
 
Safe to say my brother has been scarred for life, and my mum had a fantastic mother's day :)

**UPDATE**: for those of you curious of the outcome; my wireless has been banned, my parents think I'm a sex fiend, and my little brother is far more curious than scarred (which makes me equally proud and concerned). Oh, and a shout out to ""the squad"" who's going to be lending me their internet for the foreseeable future ;)"
2oqu3l,non_TBI,"So earlier tonight I ran out of my dorm to greet and pay the cab driver who was dropping my girlfriend off from the airport. The driver was this big Russian guy with a heavy accent, so it was pretty difficult to understand him at times. 

So after exchanging pleasantries, I asked him how much the cab fare was and he responded with something that I couldn't quite make out, but I saw ""$24.00"" on the little dashboard counter thing so I figured that's what he was telling me to pay. I pulled out two $20's and, in an effort to be nice and tip a little extra, told him, ""Just give me $10 in change!"" 

He looked at me incredulously and said ""Really?"" followed by something that was swallowed into the depths of his thick Russian accent. So my dumb ass, thinking I'd pleasantly surprised him and brightened his day a bit, just decided to give him a great, big smile and said ""Yeah! Merry Christmas!""

He just handed me the change and drove off. I was feeling damn good about myself until my girlfriend was like, ""Um, Farting_Potato, I think he was asking you why you weren't giving him any tip."" Of course, still feeling like a good person, I told her proudly that I'd tipped him above the standard 15% and he seemed pretty happy about it. 

But nope. Turns out when I was looking at the price, he hadn't added in some final costs yet and the actual total of the taxi was a little above $29. 

He had actually been saying ""Really? No tip?"" 

And I had responded ""Yep! Merry Christmas!"" with a big shit-eating grin on my face. 

Whoops.

TL;DR: Tried to be a generous person, ended up being the biggest douche this cab driver's ever met in his life.

31vu5e,non_TBI,"This FU happened this afternoon, when I was in a meeting with my boss and the CEO. This is my first job and I have been doing it only for 6 months. I talked to the CEO about work sometimes but this was the first time I had to sit in a meeting with him. When the meeting was going to end, he asked me if I got what I had to do and I responded him: ""Yes, m'lord""

My CEO is British..

Update: Since some of you asked, this is what happened after 
""CEO: Did you just address me as ""My lord""?
  Me: No... Yes.. It was unintentional, Sir
 CEO: You don't have to call me Lord or Sir, instead i will make the guys in the office call you ""My lady"" if you can reach [this number] (double the target for the project we gonna do)""
He left after that, not sure if he felt it offended or funny but my boss burst out laughing.
I mentioned he is British since he is not local and i thought he might feel offended thinking I was sarcastic."
2y00ke,non_TBI,"So this happened just today. 
I work at a Dominos pizza, and right across the street is this Dairy queen, and I've been trading pizza for dairy queen stuff with this really cute black haired girl for a bit. I built up the courage and asked for her number and we've been texting and talking to each other for about a week. today she asked if I could bring her pizza to her new place, so I jumped to the conclusion that, that was her saying ""hey come over."" Later after I clocked out, bought a pizza, and got one of my delivery drivers to drive me to her place (I don't drive and her place was on his way). She took the pizza saying ""thanks"" I stood there thinking she was going to let me in, we talked a bit and I immediately knew she wasn't down. She asked ""how did you get here?"" I said ""one of my drivers drove me"" she said ""oh did he leave?"" ""Yea..."" ""oh really! oops, can you call him back?"" So I called my driver back after he was done delivery and went into the front foyer of the house and waited, and seen this dude up stairs, I knew what was up and I just waited like 1 minute and left when my driver got outside.  he said ""what happened?"" 
""I guess she wanted the P instead of the D."" I got a ride home afterwards.

3lt2c2,non_TBI,"Yesterday was my parents 30 year wedding anniversary and some of their friends were having a party to celebrate them. My mom was floating in the pool with a cookie in her hand and she looked so pretty, I just had to take a picture. 

Right as I snap the pic, she puts the cookie in her mouth and I end up with the derpiest photo you've ever seen. I'm dying laughing, showing the picture to her friends and she yells from the pool that she wants to see it. I'm drunk so I hand her the phone,  she's drunk so she fumbles it and it goes right to the bottom of the pool. It's in the water for a good 7-8 seconds before we fish it out.  I'm upset but somehow laughing and my mom says it's karma for the bad picture. 

It's an iphone5 with no case on it and somehow, miraculously, I dry it off and it's working just fine! In a state of sobriety, I might have thought to look for advice online, but instead, I just go on using as normal. 

So here's the (bigger) fuck up. Earlier in the day, I had taken a sexy picture for my boyfriend. Instead of sending it all at once, I decided to crop it and send increasingly larger crops throughout the day until the whole thing was revealed. The most recent is a rectangle which contains nothing but my boobs, nipples covered by only a thin piece of black fabric. 

After dropping my phone in the pool, a male coworker who I am decent friends with texts me a link to something on reddit.  I open it and try to respond to him. Now, having been out of the water for țen minutes or so, my phone starts getting locked up and acting all kinds of sketchy.  I'm trying to answer the text, pressing everything on the screen but nothing is really responding. 

I manage to type out a sentence and send. All of a sudden, my phone starts freaking out and executing random commands. Close text messaging, open Vine, close Vine, open another random app. It's totally got a life of its own. If you've ever had a water logged iphone, you might recognize this behavior. I manage to get the text messaging app back on the screen, but in its erratic behavior, my phone opens the camera roll and inserts a picture. The one in the middle of the screen. The one of my boobs. I'm desperately trying to backspace and close, but my broken phone takes this to mean ""send"" and all I can do is watch in slow motion horror as I get the confirmation that my boobs have successfully been delivered to my coworker. Mortified, I try to explain, but of course I can't type anything. I finally manage ""please ignore!"" His response ""hahaha this is awesome!"" I'm not looking forward to work tomorrow. I have a feeling I won't live this down for a while. And of course, my phone doesn't work at all today. 

TL; DR - dropped phone in pool. Water logged phone freaked out and inserted pic of my boobs into text conversation with coworker.

Update: whoa. Never underestimate reddit's love of boobs. I didn't expect this to be so popular. To clarify, I did  send  a sentence explaining the pool mishap to my coworker, but I haven't talked to him since. I do know his username, to all of you claiming to be him. I do not have any photos as they are on my broken phone. I did not add the NSFW tag, it was automatic, but I think the ""bodily discharge"" is pretty funny. No I am not cheating on my boyfriend. Just period. Also, thanks for the hilarious comments and tips...silver lining I guess. "
3rlipm,non_TBI,"This happened about an hout ago: I was bored in class so I opened Binding of Isaac on my laptop. I have been tring to
complete all of the challenges, and the last one I haven't beaten yet is called the suicide king. 

In that challenge you shoot explosive tears that come back to you if they miss and enemy, and I find it bloody difficult.

After getting frustrated after dying for the tenth time I open google and type in ""How to beat suicide..."" and google already filled in the rest for me. But when I tried to click on the googles prediction I missclicked and actually searched for what I wrote in.
I retyped what I meant and didn't think much of it.

 Until after my classroom got an internal call and they demanded that I go to the principals office. Apparently the school proxy filter had picked up my suicidical searches and the IT had notified the administration, and when I arrived to the principals office the principal and the school nurse were waiting for me.

I quickly explained what had happened, and they understood the misunderstanding, but now I am sure I am under some kind of surveillance list from now on 😐

EDIT: If someone knows a solution on how to bypass the school proxy filter any helpp would be appreciated, as the blocking really makes research hard. I have tried tor, ultrasurf and freedome and all of those get stuck in connecting phase, I guess the traffic is blocked.

2e25nl,non_TBI,"My nephew Daniel is 3 years old, diagnosed with Down Syndrome, and hadn't said a word before last week. My brother and his wife have been taking him to speech therapy, but to no avail. 

Well, the stars aligned such that they were both working and, after going through all the in-laws and siblings, they chose me to take the little tyke to his appointment. 

On the way to the therapist's office, I notice a car pulling up to the street from a parking lot and think nothing of it. Lots of folks try to pull out onto the road at the first opportunity. No big deal... until the guy decides there's enough of an opening in front of me for him to get in. ""Shit! Shit! Shit!"" I yelled as I slammed on the brakes and swerved. Somehow we don't hit the guy, nor does the woman in the other lane hit me.

So heart's beating a little fast, and I'm nervous that I've scared Daniel. ""How ya doing, big fella?"" And that's when Daniel decided to talk. His first words. It was actually a little song.

*OOooh shit shit shit shit*

*ooOOoh shit shit shit shit*

*Oh shit shit shit shit*

*Oooh shit shit shit shit*

*OOoh shit shit shit shit*

*OOooh shit shit shit shit.*

I'm frantic. How do I keep the fact that his first word is a song of Shit from both the therapist and his parents? I mean, I'm proud of the little guy for talking, but geez, they're going to have my head!

Well, we get to the office, my heart's racing, and the therapist is a pro. She comes out of her office, kneels down to his level, and asks, ""Hi Daniel, how do you feel today?"" And my heart sank as Daniel performed an encore of his hit single, ""Oh Shit.""

*OOooh shit shit shit shit*

*ooOOoh shit shit shit shit*

*Oh shit shit shit shit*

*Oooh shit shit shit shit*

*OOoh shit shit shit shit*

*OOooh shit shit shit shit.*

I have no idea where he got this tune, but the lyrics clearly came from me. I'm panic-stricken. Dumbfounded. Thoroughly embarrassed. The therapist? She never misses a beat. ""I see that you're talking now! That's great, Daniel!"" And she took his hand and they walked back into the office/ playroom. What a pro.

My sister-in-law still isn't speaking to me.

Edit: I have sent /u/ThePeoplesBard the gist of the tune. Hopefully he'll come through a recording of his version soon. I'll edit the OP with a link when he does.

I'm sitting up on my bed and she's sitting next to me. I have a full on diamond cutter and I'm ready to go. She starts using her hand and spitting on me for lubrication (hot). I took my time with her, was slow and thorough and did and excellent job. It's apparent she's going to return the favor. Great.

She then says I have a nice body (thanks) and says that I must take care of myself (I do) and then asks if I'm a vegan (a little weird). I say that I'm not a vegan, but I try to eat a clean and balanced diet. She then says that she's a vegan and literally starts talking about how great it is and that I should become one because it's healthier (now this shit is getting officially weird).

I start thinking that maybe we've got a hostage situation on our hands and this is this girl's thing. She takes her pleasure, gets you by the shaft and then starts trying to convert you to veganism while she has you trapped in the most compromising of circumstances.

Keep in mind, while she keeps talking, she's still giving me a handjob and occasionally spitting/letting saliva drip down onto my member. 

It was like I was trapped in some Kubrick fever dream.

So then things take a turn for the worse and she starts saying some ridiculously and truly stupid shit about how we'd all live to be 100 if everyone would stop eating meat and meat is far worse for you than smoking, and humans didn't really evolve to eat meat, and other nonsense. 

The entire time I'm just trying to relax, zone out and ignore it, or wondering if I should make some witty joke about my ""meat"" or something.

Then she finally goes down on me.

Now, any normal human being would just be like, ""Ah, finally."" Any normal human being would just shut up and enjoy the magnificent bit of artistry being performed upon them.

Not me.

The stupid shit that she said starts floating through my head and it gnaws at me. I know I shouldn't say anything, but I can't help myself, so I open up my big stupid yap and say I don't think some of the things she says were factually accurate.

We then proceed to have at least a 15-20 minute debate about the ethics of eating meat, whether or not humans are designed to eat meat, veganism's effects on athlete performance, as well as an assortment of other related topics. 

The entire time, we were both still naked, I was still erect, and she still had me gripped firmly in her hand. 

It was a level of absurdity I hope to never come close to again. I wish I had it on film so I could sell it as the crowning achievement in a video series titled, ""How not to get laid.""

Finally, we agreed to disagree seeing as neither of us were going to budge from our positions, and she commented that it was getting late, got dressed, and left.

I jerked off alone in the dark.

**TL;DR - Tried to get blown, ended up arguing about veganism mid-blowjob. Ended up not getting blown. Jerked off alone in the dark.** "
2zh5eq,non_TBI,"So basically A long time ago I lost my glasses. I never bothered to get them replaced and I just lived with the fact that EVERYTHING was marginally out of focus. It turns out that's not such a good thing if you want to process information well. Because I couldn't see I felt stupid. My brain was no longer working to process all of this visual information. Or it could mean my brain was taxing itself way to hard. Anyway I just received my new eye glasses and absolutely everything is in stunning clarity. As soon as I put them on I could feel my brain snap back into attention. This story isn't meant to be funny. Seriously if you cant see go to an optometrist you could be sabotaging your brain. 

Edit 1: So last night as I was walking home I saw the stars for the first time CLEARLY and it was amazing. My friend pulled up and gave me a ride back to my house as we were coming over the hill I was amazed at the 
literal cascade of city lights before me. It was so beautiful. 

Edit 2: in the last 24 hrs ive discovered that vision not only affects the obvious but also sound and generally cognition. We gather so much visually from our environment. I think being in that space between seeing and not seeing is worse than being blind because the brain cannot make sense out of the blurry shapes. Its in a state of flux whereas being completely blind fully allows it to adapt to the lack of visual input. I literally feel like I have super vision now. How come people who need perfect vision for a living like a pilot or an archer dont just get glasses? Is perfect vision truly perfect with out glasses or contacts? Are we even meant to see with such clarity or is the fact that so many people have eye problems an indication of something much bigger happening in humanity?

Edit 3: I used to be a photographer but I stopped right around the time I lost my glasses. I hope that now with my new found sight I can appreciate my gift again. Sight involves so many things beyond seeing, dont let not seeing take away your gifts or abilities."
2v4l9q,non_TBI,"I'm partially deaf in both ears, and have been since birth.
The technology I use to get through school life consists of a receiver that connects to my hearing aid, and a microphone that teachers have to wear so I can hear them in class, it acts as a kind of walkie talkie type of thing. It has made things much easier, and has helped me on many
occasions. 

But not this one.

So after the teacher leaves the room to go somewhere I think nothing of it, and everything
continues as usual. 

Couple moments later I hear the some cracks in my ear. Whatever, it's probably nothing, just my hearing aid playing up. Then I remember the teacher still has the microphone thing around her neck. So the next few moments were a blur of hilarity and horror as I heard a sequence of rock hard lumps of shit hitting the bottom of the toilet . She was taking a shit and i heard every second of it.
I started laughing in the middle of the lesson but nobody knew why.
The teaching assistant tried to calm me down and asked me what I was laughing at but I refused to tell her.
When the teacher came back into the classroom, I could not look her in the eyes, as I had a vision of her sat on the toilet taking a shit.

Deafinitely wouldn't want to experience that again."
3cmcnn,non_TBI,"Okay this happened couple of Sundays ago at my nephews birthday party. There were about 15 kids there age raging from 2-6. I was inside trying to entertain my nephew and his friends. So I got some ketchup packets and twisted one end to make it into a ball with all the ketchup built up on one end. I had my nephew stand at the end of living room next to the patio door. I went hadouken! And threw one at him. The kids loved it, maybe it was just the sound I was making. Every time he would say faster faster! So about my tenth one I did full baseball windup and went hadouken! I fling it like a damn fireball. At the same time some random kid decided to run into the house from the patio. BOOM! Direct headshot. The kids head goes back, but the ketchup packet exploded on contact and it sprayed ketchup on the back wall, and the same time there was a mom standing behind me, she started screaming bloody murder! Full chaos breaks out, then people realize it was ketchup. Still no one laughed but me, and I was the outcast the rest of the party.

TL;DR: Hadoukened a ketchup packet, hits random kid explodes and parents thought I murdered a child.

Edit: wow this really took off, and thank you to the one who gave me gold"
3noysy,non_TBI,"On the train, a girl about 2 feet from me has her fly open. I tell her about it and then she says ""Why are you looking there?"" She closes it thereafter.

Everyone on the train gives me a mild death stare.

Disappointing when I was only trying to help. I guess people were angry at me for telling her as now they wouldn't be able to look there anymore."
2duhxh,non_TBI,"Around 4 months ago I put in for PTO time so I could take my wife and son on vacation. After making all my arrangements my boss came up and asked if I could reschedule my vacation because there was a very important meeting the week I scheduled my vacation. I told him I couldn't really reschedule anything and finally we settled with me being on a webcam/conference call type deal for the meeting. 

I agreed and went on vacation, well come time for the meeting I set up my laptop in the hotel room. The meeting was fairly early in the morning so I woke up and I dropped my wife off at some tourist trap she wanted to see. The place she was going wasn't for kids so my son stayed and slept. I came back to the hotel and the meeting started. The meeting went well for the most part.

1 hour into the meeting my wife called and needed picked up. I told my boss I had to go get my wife id be back in 20 minutes. So I left to go get my wife, I left my son in the hotel and told him id be back in 20 minutes. I screen locked the laptop, I didn't know they could still see and hear everything with the laptop locked but they could. Long story short after I left my 13 year old son decided it would be a good time to jerk off, so he did. In front of my boss and about 20+ other employees on the conference call. They seemed to be OK about the whole situation and I wasn't fired. Still however the most embarrassing thing ever.

TL;DR My kid masturbated in front of my bosses and some other employees.                  Update: few questions I'll answer. My wife cannot drive because she has epilepsy,  she used to drive but stopped after she started having frequent seizures. Also they did end the call after somebody pointed it out, from what my friend told me he noticed about 6 minutes after I left when some lady pointed it out and after that it was cut within a minute.

3e8p0f,non_TBI,"I recently started indoor rock climbing as a way to stay in shape, and finally got my friend to go with me as well. He started to get the hang of things and we were having an awesome time.

A really skilled climber went in front of us (about 10 ft. away) and he had a smallish tattoo on his shoulder.

It looked like this really shredded guy really struggling to get to the top of a climb, which I thought was a pretty badass tattoo for a climber.

""Dang, that's a baller tattoo, maybe I can get one down the road if I get better at climbing. Do you think the guy in the tattoo makes it? I don't think he's going to make it.""

My friend looked at the guys shoulder, looked back at me, turned red, called me an asshole, and stormed out of the climbing gym.

That's when I saw that the tattoo wasn't of a climber making a climb, but rather Jesus struggling to survive on the cross. I have never felt so embarrassed in my entire life. He hasn't talked to me since.

Bonus fuck-up: my friend is a very religious Christian and I am Jewish. 

"
2ztdis,non_TBI,"So this just happened a few minutes ago, and I'm typing this out as my roommate is still laughing at me. A little background before we get into the juicy details: 
I tend to get very vocal when I'm alone, which can be expressed in various ways. Singing, talking to myself, yelling at random things, and making new/fascinating noises are the usual things I do, maybe to fill the space or just because I'm weird when alone, I'm not sure, go ask science. 
Anywho, I happened to be alone on this particular day, and decided to take a long hot shower. Standing in the shower I begin to sing the song of my people, while dancing like an idiot. 
Recently I've managed to pick my lazy Cheeto crusted butt off the couch to hit the gym, and today I'm quite sore. Stretching the muscles with hot water running down them was amazing, and so I began to make noises that only the most sexually thirsty person would make. 
Phrases like ""Oh baby yes"" and ""Fuck meeee, oh yeah"" and the classic ""Do me dirty"" were all spilling out of my mouth with the passion of a thousand burning suns. 
Finishing my shower I towel off and open the door, but horror strikes me as I round that opening. I was too excited to be alone for a weekend afternoon that I didn't think WHY I was alone, and as it turns out my roommate's family was out to lunch with him. So there I am, towel around my waist, staring at his mom, dad, and even 12 year old sister, all of us mouth agape.They clearly heard more than enough of my mating calls, and all I'm capable of doing is muttering ""uhh"" and retreating to my room a red faced embarrassed mess. 
As my roommate tells me, his entire family laughed as soon as I left, not because of the noises they heard, but because I was alone in the shower and there were noises enough for two. 
TL:DR Sang the song of my people, the song should have been on mute

My Mom hearing the crashing noise (and I hate how fast her response time was) runs into the bathroom just in time to witness a bathroom full of broken glass and water, me lying naked on the bathroom floor with a cut up back from all the glass, and with an erection still ejaculating over myself.

2ju81i,non_TBI,"So unlike most TIFUs this actually happened today, though I wish it hadn't.
Things were getting pretty hot and heavy in the bedroom, when I decided it was his turn to be taken care of. I started giving him a blowjob, that's when he decided he wanted things to be rougher tonight. He shoved my head down forcefully onto his dick once, gag reflex protested so I pulled my head away. Gave it a second and started going at it again, and he does the same thing. Now I don't mind if that's what he wants, I'm all about pleasing him in the bedroom, but we had just eaten not long before that and something about a dick being jammed down my throat doesn't make my stomach sit well. And protest my stomach did. I threw up. Right out of my nose, not a whole lot, but enough. I look up to see he noticed anything, nothing, just slack jawed ""gettin my dick sucked"" bliss on his face. I decide I can't ruin this, and more than anything I can't tell him... How exactly do I fix this?!
My mind is racing when I come up with an idea. A terrible terrible idea. I ate it, Reddit. I ate my puke off of his stomach to avoid having to tell him I threw up on him. I fucking ate it. I will never have any self respect again."
2g7ww5,non_TBI,"Today, I was riding around in a wheelchair that happened to be at my fraternity house and rolled into the parking lot as another kid in a wheel chair rolled by. He stopped and talked with me a little bit, legitimately great guy and invited me to some sort of wheelchair basketball league. I didn't know how to tell him that I am not actually crippled so now I am signed up for practice in a few hours. 
Edit: Apparently, my school has won the most national wheelchair championships in the nation and is a big deal. Considering going to practice and trying to start. Can I dunk still?
Edit #2: Okay, I did some research and they have really expensive custom wheelchairs specifically for basketball and I have a generic hospital one. I roll in there they know i'm a fake. Practice is in two hours. Thank God I always miss leg day. 

Final Edit: Okay. I went to practice. I fucked up. I never implied I was crippled but when I rolled in with my wheel chair it was sort of implied. It went down hill immediately when they asked me to switch to another chair I could borrow. I brought it to the hallway( told them I needed to grab my inhaler from my bag, and I actually have asthma so fuck you)  and did the best paraplegic transition between wheelchairs I could manage. Why did I even go to begin with? One being sweet sweet karma and the other would be I wanted to try it out. anyways, it was going decent, except it was completely obvious I never maneuvered in a sports wheel chair let alone played basketball before.  It was embarrassing as fuck, and at one point the ball landed on my nuts and I audibly cursed. It was all going decent, it was a very informal thing kind of like a pick up game but organized by some group. Long story short it just kept going worse and worse for me until I tipped over but held myself up like a tri-pod and realized i've never gotten up from this before without my legs. A few people started watching me and were going to help a crippled kid up ( me). I decided then and there I couldn't do this any longer and just stood up and actually did a sort of limp to my chair and went to the hallway. Fuck you reddit for encouraging my bad decisions. "
3dhq3d,non_TBI,"My mother always has these fanciful bottle of shampoo she uses. There was one that caught my eye with those floral designs and hipster font based texts.

So last night I came home, feeling really awesome with myself, I was looking around for this floral shampoo of her's. And it just wasn't there. And I realised mid crotch washing, the shampoo was under the sink(yes I bend over to wash what's down under) and in my head was ""oh, so this shampoo is so fabulous that you would hide it from son huh. I am so gonna squeeze the shit out of you""

It's texture was really really viscous. But it had a baby blue colour which I couldn't remember, I had a vague memory that it was a clear brown colour, I shook it off as a different scent of formula. Especially since this bottle is new and filled to the brim.

10 mins after trying to wash the shampoo off my head, it was still so God damn bloody soapy. My hands were getting tired (maybe from agressive washing down under), it felt as if someone was secretly pouring more of the shampoo on me. And the bubbles that formed, it felt like a bubble party.

30 mins has elapsed and I was clearly pissed.

I opened the door and screamed for mom.

""WHAT SHAMPOO IS THIS?! WHE DOES IT NOT WASH AWAY!?????""

Mom comes and asks which shampoo am I using.

""YOUR PRECIOUS ONE UNDER THE SINK""

I am so pissed, she was laughing so hard, and all I could do was continue scrubbing my damn foam filled hair.

It was a good five mins which felt like eternity to me, before she got her composure back and said ""That's not shampoo my dear, I filled it up with Dynamo(it's a super laundry detergent designed to get the thoughest of thoughest stains off clothes) that's why I put it under the sink love. I need to tell your dad.

""OH GOD WHY WOULD YOU PUT DETERGENT IN A SHAMPOO BOTTLE FOR F SAKE!""

Never judge a shampoo by it's bloody bottle.

Latest Update: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2z6b65/tifupdate_by_sexting_my_girlfriends_sister_and/

Now to what happened on Thanksgiving. 

So my gf's sister showed up Wednesday afternoon and everything was going perfectly fine throughout the day. I left around 4 ish to grab some beer and wine before Thanksgiving. When I came home I could hear yelling from the front door and when I walked in it only intensified. My gf and her sister were in full fledged fuck you mode. Once I walked through the door, they both stopped yelling, and the sister went upstairs. I asked what it was about and it was about the sexting incident again. I got them both together and asked them to just play it off until Thanksgiving was over and we could talk the day after.

Thanksgiving happens, there was a lot of tension in the air but my gf and her sister played it off pretty well, nothing too suspicious. Her parents don't expect anything and they left all good.

Literally 5 minutes after they left, the house exploded. My girlfriend was yelling at her sister for ""Eyeing"" me all evening. I genuinely didn't notice, but I am somewhat flattered. I told them to calm down and they both told me to fuck off basically and I ended up sleeping on the coach last night.

Now here I am about 20 hours after being banished to the coach. My girlfriends sister left in the morning didn't say good bye just left a note saying she wouldn't be talking to us anymore and to enjoy Christmas without her. My gf proceeded to break down into tears and blame me for all this. We talked about an hour ago and it's better now between us. But I'm pretty sure I broke two sisters apart.

**Td;dr: Make sure you read the name of the person you're sexting before you do it redditors. Otherwise, you'll find yourself feeling guilty and pretty bummed**

2umxzz,non_TBI,"This was two days ago, but whatever.  

So, me and a buddy had been drinking in Manchester (UK) watching some rugby, you know, Brit stuff.  After a long afternoon session of beer and large men hurting each other we headed off into the night to catch the last train home to our town (about 40 mins away).

We board the train and it's pretty quiet, few other drunks but that was about it.  We where oblivious to the brunette sat on the other side of the train and like drunken fools, we decide that it would be great to have a sing along and see if we can get the other drinkers involved.  So we started out with a rendition of ""Don't wanna miss a thing"" that probably sounded like we where slaying multiple cats.  After the first verse and chorus this brunette must've decided enough was enough and shouted at us to shut up.  No drama in my eyes as it couldn't have been pleasant.  But not to my buddy.  No no, this devious little bastard didn't wanna give up and elequently told the woman to ""Show us your dick"" (Don't blame him, he was drunk).  

Much to my surprise this woman draws a bright blue dildo out of a bag and throws it at him.  Shes not a great shot as I got a forehead full of rubber dick.  This is then followed up packets of lube and a secondary dildo.  Turns out we pissed of a sexual education teacher, she gathered her dicks and lube and sat quietly to wait for her stop.  

TL;DR: Sang Aerosmith, got hit in the face with a dildo.

So about a month ago, I taught a JA (Junior Achievement) class at a local elementary school. I'm an education major, so I figured this would be good experience. I taught the same lesson to 5 different 5th grade classes throughout the day, and it was about creating a new product and giving a sales pitch. 

Towards the end of the day, I had a class that was rather rowdy, so I made sure to really watch over them and get involved in their projects. I stopped by one group of boys and was intrigued by their drawing. I asked what they were making, and one boy said, ""It's a giant roller coaster!"" 

Awesome! Creativity! As I was about to give them a compliment on their project, one of the other boys looks at me and says, ""Yeah! Giant just like Ryan's mom!"" He pointed at Ryan, and Ryan looked at me with the saddest of eyes, hoping that the boy would be reprimanded. Instead of being an adult, I FUCKING LOST IT. I laughed so hard, right in front of Ryan. Ryan proceeded to bawl his eyes out and start hitting his head off of his desk. 

I just walked away and told the actual teacher that he was having some sort of meltdown and stayed away from that group for the rest of their class. 

Tl;dr:

Laughed at a 5th grade ""your mom"" joke, made kid cry instead of being an adult, avoided kid rest of the day.

EDIT:

Everyone needs to chill. I felt like shit after I did it, that's why it's on TIFU...because I fucked up. The only teaching experience I had up to that point was with high school students, where this scenario would have played out a lot smoother. I guess it was just a natural reaction, and I guess that's why I'm getting my degree in secondary Ed. 

EDIT #2:

Before I walked away I looked at the other kids and asked them to focus on the project, but I will admit I didn't do anything to help Ryan because what the hell do I do with a kid that is repeatedly smashing his head off his desk? Also, the joke wasn't funny. I guess I laughed because I totally didn't expect that kid to say it. Kind of like one of those ""oh my god"" laughs. 

EDIT #3:

This is my final edit. You better believe I would apologize to the kid now, but I won't see him ever again unless I coincidentally teach another JA class with him in it. I'm looking at it a little more light-heartedly because he was all buddy buddy with his group until I showed up and the other kid said it. Probably still should have talked to him, but we all make mistakes. Definitely taking this as a learning experience. Thanks for all the comments and upvotes! This is my first post to really take off. "
33tqtb,non_TBI,"So this happened a little under two months ago, but I felt as if this had to be shared because it was extremely traumatizing.

So my girlfriend and I were getting it on for the first time, and it involved really good foreplay and cuddling and whatnot. With me, when it comes to a new person for the first time, my nerves can get the best of me and sometimes I suffer from performance anxiety when it comes to first times with others, so during sex I had a hard time keeping it up (my penis that is) simply because of the nerves I was experiencing. My girlfriend understood completely and we decided to take a break and try again in maybe 30 minutes. 

So when we finally got into it again, it was much better. We were really going at it missionary style when she says to me, ""when you cum just pull out and do it on my stomach."" That was fine with me, so I kept going until 15 seconds later she said, ""Yeah. Better out than in I always say."" At that moment I exploded. I laughed so fucking hard and my erection disappeared faster than most things possibly can. I was on her bed with my limp dick in her and I was losing it. Needless to say, sexy time went unfinished that night, and that was that. Thankfully, she found it really funny too, and takes some of the blame for it. Shrek is love, shrek is life.

TL;DR - Having sex with girlfriend for first time, she makes shrek joke, I laugh so hard I lose my erection, sex over. "
372770,non_TBI,"I feel like a fucking idiot. Something something didn't happen today.

Me and my girlfriend browse Reddit all the time. We read the r/TIFU front page almost every night before we doze off. Thank for giving us hours of entertainment, r/TIFU.

Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I cooked a fucking AMAZING dinner for my girlfriend. You should've seen this shit. Fried shrimp that I spiced myself with all of her favorite ingredients. Garlic, pepper, lemon, and I even seeded a couple of jalapenos and threw the fresh seeds in to make them extra spicy, just like we both love. Throw in some homemade sweet potato fries, and a spinich salad, and I've made the most delicious and sexiest dinner ever. If I was a white girl I would've Instagrammed that shit.

We ate together and she's telling me how much she loved the food. She kept commenting during the meal that it was amazing. I was fucking proud of myself. I've made some pretty decent meals in the past, but this one was fucking epic.

Fast forward a couple hours, and me and my girlfriend climb into bed. Once there, sexy times commence. We're both really into it. After some rough and tumble, I finish and it's my turn to pleasure her. So, without hesitation, I start fingering her. She's moaning and enjoying it for a few moments... until she utters the words I never thought I'd ever be scared to hear:

*""Do you still have jalapeno juice on your fingers?""*

Ten seconds later, she's running out of bed, and jumping into a cold bath. I hung my head in shame and embarrassment.

I read a story exactly like this among the top of all time on this page... I should've known. I know it's a story you all have probably read before, but in the moment I felt like I fucked up royally (and ironically) enough to warrant a post. Not to mention, my girlfriend said when she climbed out of the tub, *""Haven't you read enough TIFU to know better!?""*

TL;DR: Made an awesome dinner for the gf, fingered her with spicy hands and might as well have shoved a jalapeno in her clam.

**-----**

EDIT: Thanks for all the help amd advice, guys. Now I have plenty have things to put in my girlfriend's vagina when this happens again.

I'm getting a lot of questions and confusion, so here's a little FAQ...

> 1) Why didnt you wash your hands, you sick fuck!?

A: I did. Once, after eating the meal, but not very well. Although some people have commented that washing your hands doesn't help in the first place. Go figure.

> 2) ""Sexy times""? Do you really say that shit to your girlfriend, you neckbeard??

A: Yeah, I do.

> 3) You finished first??? UGH, you're an asshole.

A: Yeah, she was on top, and I finished before she did. Not like I wasn't planning on helping her finish... hence the touching.

> 4) Did she really say that when she came out of the bathroom? Did this really happen?

A: Yep.

> 5) What's the recipe?

A: 1 lemon's worth of juice... 4 cloves of garlic... 1 Tbsp of black pepper... 1/2 tbsp of thyme... 1/2 tbsp of oregano... 2 jalapeno's worth of seeds... salt to taste. Saute shrimp in a pan with butter and olive oil.

* Well, now my top post ever is this FU. Looks like we'll never really forget this happened. Thanks everyone.

This week, we have been working so hard to break her of the habit, and for the past few days has been going by herself. 

My periods are usually pretty heavy. I realized I had waited too long to take out a tampon when I went to pee, and it slid out in all of its bloody glory straight into the toilet. My dad constantly lectured me growing up about making sure I never flush any feminine hygiene products into the toilet, so naturally, I panicked and decided to reach in to get it. My hand clenched down on the bloody tampon, and I quickly pulled it out of the murky water. Only it wasn't a tampon. It was a big ol' unflushed preschooler turd log. In my haste to grab the tampon, I had put a master grip on that turd, and it was squishing through my fingers. Super grossed out, I quickly chucked what I could of the turd back into the toilet only to realize I still hadn't retrieved the tampon. In what had to be the least fun game of fishing, I re-thrusted my hand back into the toilet, and splashed around haphazardly looking for the hidden string. After an eternity, I triumphantly grabbed the tampon string, only to realize that I was triumphantly grabbing a tampon string. 
TLDR: My hands will never be clean again

2zcjwc,non_TBI,"This actually happened yesterday, so YIFU.

So I'm at the SXSW Interactive/Film festival.  Two nights ago (Saturday), my girlfriend and I are stumbling home after a night of Lone Stars and music.  We get to our hotel and the lobby bar is still rocking at 2:30am.  As we walk past the lunatics still partying, en route to the elevator bank, a friend spots me and yells ""hey VOHIT4ROHIT!"".  We go over to the bar, catch up for a sec, and I notice his crew is leaning on the bar next to, sorta with Mark Cuban.


My jaw drops, this is the moment I've been waiting for for a long time.  Now I'm not a fan of the Dallas Mavericks, but I do appreciate Mark Cuban's success and his outspokenness. But that's not what I want to tell him.  What I want to go up to and tell him is that a few years ago I had a dream about him, where I gave him a sandwich and we became friends.  I even [tweeted that brief, amazing story](http://i.imgur.com/YrWljAf.png?1) to him to following morning (which he obviously never wrote back to): 

>just remembered that last night i dreamed i was friends with @mcuban and we were eating sandwiches. now i'm sad it'll never be...

I chickened out.  I have no problem with talking to celebrities - in my line of work we come across them all the time at parties, events, shoots, etc - so it was not me being star struck in any way.  
Even though he was openly talking to whoever was near him, I couldn't be the weirdo that goes up to Mark Cuban and tells him about a dream that he was in.  

I regretted missing out on the moment over and over.  My girlfriend was getting tired of me whining about it. I literally couldn't stop thinking about it.  I HATE missed opportunities - because they equal regrets.

And then yesterday (Monday) afternoon we're walking through our hotel lobby, and guess who walks by...

Mark Cuban is hurriedly going the opposite direction.  

This is my shot.

""Hey Mark!""  He slows down.
""Hey dude"" Mark says with a warm friendly smile, coming to a full stop.
Now is my chance to tell the story, the one I've been waiting for years to tell him.  I see he's in a rush so I quickly thrust my hand out for a hand shake and begin speed talking...
""Hey Mark, I don't want to tell you about being a fan or whatever, but I want to tell you about my dream.  You were in my dream.  This was a couple years ago.  And we were good friends because I gave you a sandwich.  But then I woke up and was sad.  And I wanted to tell you this the other night but I chickened out.  But I figured you'd appreciate it.  And now we're actually seeing each other but I don't have a sandwich for you.  And you never Tweeted back at me, by the way.  So I just thought I'd tell you that, to finally get it off my chest.  So I guess we're friends now.  Ha!""
I was talking so fast that I couldn't process the degree that I creeped this man out.  Halfway through my 30 second diatribe he began slowly walking away, with his mouth in a frown, and his eyes darting everywhere except towards me.
His only response was a forced smile and ""k"".
I've been cringing for the last 24 hours.  

TL;DR - I had a dream about Mark Cuban 3 years ago and then threw spaghetti at him yesterday, and he probably thinks I'm a stalker.

**update 3/18:** I got back to the office this morning.  [My whole company has had a good laugh about it and decided to decorate my desk.](http://imgur.com/a/zKW4q)

3vk1lz,non_TBI,"I was struggling with a hard case of morning wood, which my wife and I refer to as the “morning hornies.” She wasn’t particularly engaged by the sight of my swollen penis and told me to “do what I do.” Never one to resist the urge to fire my main weapon, I unloaded the carcasses of my extra little men on her stomach. Record time, too – 3 minutes; good stuff. Feeling pride in my work, I hopped from our bed and turned on the shower, ready to refresh. Returning to the bedroom while the water warmed to a toasty temp, my wife lie napping peacefully. Why would I not interrupt that? Without a thought, I bounded over to partake in my most favorite of farty timbres, the belly motorboat. I planted my head in her stomach and proceeded to blast a raspberry with deserved force. It was very wet, and rather salty down there.

TL;DR: Don’t jizz on you wife then rub your face in it, unless you’re into the sort of thing.

The same love and happiness that we have! We aren't perfect by any means. I just called him an hour ago to complain at him because he finished the milk and didn't add it to the list. My cereal was already poured! Thanks again for everyone's kind words. I hope you all find the love we share. It is work, and some days we both say things we don't mean, but I know I wouldn't trade my worst day with him for my best day with anyone else, and I hope he feels the same!

TL;DR: my hubby found my letter and responded with his own letter. We didn't get to talk and I have a bunch of questions but will give him the space that he is telling me he needs to grow and figure out this part of him. Also weed.


Hey guys! I'm not 100% sure where to put this update, so hopefully it doesn't get deleted!!!

I'll start with saying that after a bunch of awesome advice and encouragement, I bought a Sephora gift card and loaded it with $150 of the money I was saving to visit my sister and mom this summer. It was important to me that I spend my money, and not my husband's. I stopped doing nails professionally when I had my first daughter. It just seemed easier and we didn't have the money to pay for childcare, so now I babysit sometimes and do nails for people at my house occasionally. Definitely not steady income. 

I also included a letter I wrote to him written on the parchment we made together on our honeymoon. I told him how much he means to me and that he is my best friend. I also added that I would like to talk but understand if he isn't ready. I thanked him for our beautiful daughters and for being the best person I've ever known. And I left it at that. He went to work around 5:45 am and was home about 3 pm, which was awesome. We dropped the girls off at my mother in laws house to be baby sat by my sister in law until my best friend got off work. We went to the store and bought a bunch of the food we don't allow our toddler to have. I had an 1/8th of Mr. Nice Guy, a strain a good friend of ours grows and sells to dispensaries around here. Basically, the night was set.. 

We had a great time laughing and just spending time together. We actually took a shower together for the first time since we were dating. It was very sweet and intimate. My husband was the one who suggested the shower. We probably spent 30 minutes just laughing and goofing off under hot water. I'm sorry if that isn't as romantic as some people envision, but for us, that is romance. I knew by the way he was acting that he had found the letter. He was being very touchy and kissy. I could see how vulnerable he was but I let him take the reigns on the night. After our shower, we dried off and drove to an old smoking spot of ours. He smoked a few snaps and we spent an hour on the tailgate of our truck, listening to the wind and crickets and laughing about how different our lives were from when we met. We reminisced about a lot, and he held me when I got cold. At this point I didn't think my husband would initiate any conversation about the makeup. 

We were literally buckling our seat belts to head home when he stopped and looked me in the eyes and said  ""Thank you."" And he kissed me like it was our wedding night. And then he drove home. 

I cleaned up the kitchen and he disappeared into the garage. At this point it was about 10 and I was getting sleepy. Remember, I have a two month old so I haven't slept through the night in quite some time. I had to pump like there was no tomorrow so I settled down on the couch and turned on Community. I find funny stuff is the easiest at distracting me from the pain of my cracked nips. 


While I was pumping my husband must have come in and gone to bed. I went into the garage to find it empty. I was actually hurt because I wasn't sure why he went to bed without saying goodnight. I climbed into bed and put my back to him haha. He moved across the bed and spooned me. I fell asleep comforted but confused. 

He sneaked out this morning without waking me. My alarm went off at 7 to go pick up the girls. I wandered into the bathroom and found a letter sitting on the toilet.

My husband had written me, I'm assuming either at work or while he was in the garage or both. The garage at our house is basically a room where my husband and I play our video games and hang when the girls are sleeping. There is a couch and a table and tv. All its missing is heat.

In the letter, my husband was very sweet. He explained that he just likes to feel pretty sometimes, and that he didn't start this until we met and he would watch me put on my makeup and see how much prettier I felt. He thanked me for the gift card and laughed at it. He told me he loves me and is happy I picked him to spend my life with. Then he told me right now, he just can't talk about this with me face to face. One day, he assured me, he will be ready, even though he doesn't know when that will be. 


I have a few questions for him, but I understand and I will wait. I'm sorry if I don't have any more to update, or that this didn't turn into a giant Jerry Springer episode where it turns out my husband was blowing dudes in the back of our campground or wanting to leave me, because we all know that would make for a more interesting story. 

Thanks again for all of your support guys. "
3c0br2,non_TBI,"So this just happened a short while ago and I'm vexed as fuck.

I matched with a cute girl on tinder. Kind of a weird nose, but otherwise pretty cool. Self described activist, pansexual, and asking for ""hookups only."" I wasn't really on tinder for the sex (I'm sure the internet will believe that, but seriously I'm new in town and am meeting people any way I can), but I'm always down to get a blowjob, because who isn't. I messaged her asking what the scope of a hookup is and if she practices safe sex (seemed like a good idea to ask), we had a very frank and enjoyable conversation about sexual preferences, and she seemed to match pretty well with me. She gave me her snapchat, we exchanged some pics (with less than socially acceptable amounts of clothing).

I had plans tonight, but told her I was free afterwards. She replied similarly. I asked her if she wanted me to come over later. She said she wanted me to fuck her later.

Later comes around, she gives me her address. I went over, jokingly texting a friend ""If I die, tell them I died trying."" I got a little lost, arriving at her house a little after midnight.

I text her, she comes out and tells me to park in the driveway. I enter the house, her roommate is sitting on the couch. They offer me a pre-mixed drink. I think very little of it, but remember that my mama always taught me not to take drinks from strangers. I jokingly refuse. They insist. I pull out the apple juice I brought in case I didn't like whatever they were mixing (I know apple juice + vodka is icky, but all they had was cranberry... ew). The kitchen is just around the corner. I head to the kitchen, assuming the vokda will be sitting out. The vodka is nowhere to be seen.

I enter the living room to ask where the vodka was. The girl says I need to leave. I ask why. She says, ""I don't really owe you an explanation."" I leave, confused.

On the way home I think it over. The only thing I had done before getting kicked out was refusing the drink.

I text her, telling her that I think the only reason she would have acted in the way she acted was if the drink was drugged. She tells me I didn't look as attractive in person as I did on snapchat.

Best case scenario: Girl thought I was ugly as fuck in person.
Worst case scenario: Girl tried to drug my drink with ill intentions.

tl:dr; I went on a tinder date and may have nearly gotten drugged + raped/murdered.

Edit: Since so many people are commenting on the apple juice, drinks had been discussed, and she said that she had cranberry juice and vodka. I think cranberry juice is kind of icky, so I brought a clearly labeled bottle of apple juice. Probably should have texted her telling her I was bringing it, but it didn't even occur to me that it was weird to bring my own mixer."
2ofde7,non_TBI,"*Update: All jokes aside, I genuinely appreciate all the replies on here. This situation fucking sucked and not knowing anyone on campus sucks to. I always believed all comedy comes form a dark place and helps deal with shit and you guys just proved my point. Thank you*

This happened about a month ago. I just read another recent post about inscest on here so I thought I'd post this.

Backstory:
- I was *finally* starting to break some ground in my freshmen year by breaking out of my shell. For me, even saying hi or smiling at a classmate was a big step.
- I've been dating the same girl for over three years now and we've known each other since middle school. When we were kids, her mom would refer to me as her son and my mom would refer to her as her daughter. We would occasionally joke about the whole inscest aspect of our relationship when we started dating.
- Since iOS 8 came out we've been sending each other lots of voice memos instead of texts.

The Story:
The university I'm attending is in a city that is notorious for being hard to make friends in. It's a completely new area for me and I know absolutely no one. The fact that I was starting to at least talk to classmates was a huge positive step for me.

We get our usual break in class and I stay at the spot and check my texts. I see that my GF sent me a voice memo (it's usually quirky silly things) and I raise the phone up to my ear to listen to it. The voice memo is her saying in a very sensual voice ""do you miss your sister's mouth?"" The volume was loud enough that everyone two rows in front of me and behind me could hear me. Not positive if the prof heard. I start sweating bullets and just turn red. Word quickly spread through campus and now I just go to the library during my breaks and study. I figure I'll make friends when I get a job."
2beksa,non_TBI,"EDIT: ... and Scene. SHE FOUND IT. 5:15pm EST. 5 hours. Good work guys! 

I have been ""dating"" again, and like many 20-somethings in Brooklyn, I have been doing with the aid of the internet. After browsing the dating pool on the popular dating site ""OKCupid"" I found myself texting this girl a couple times. I suggest we meet in prospect park and walk around. 

For those of you who have never been, Prospect Park is a bit bigger than your standard ""park."" Designed Fredrick Law Olmstead in 1850something, this thing is almost 600 acres with tons of small paths and arches and small corners. When she suggested we bring a couple canned beers along for the walk, I was into it. I figure, keep them in bags, spend some time on the lass traveled bits and have a nice date walking and talking and sipping. 

Around 2 hours into our date, we find a nice little bench by the water to hang out. After about 20 minutes of chilling a GIANT police cruiser pulls up. Anyone who is relatively irresponsible in New York knows what happens next: they take your ID, run it to look for warrants, and after they determine you are not wanted for anything more serious, they write you a $25 ticket and leave you alone. 

We sit on the bench for what seems like a while, patiently waiting for them to do their thing, making short jokes about our records and how this is going to make a great story. I noticed there was an issue when I saw the first office get out of the car with only one license/ticket. The other guy got out and started unloading the stuff from his back seat to the trunk. 

I vividly remember getting an open container offense a couple years ago (different park), but I only vaguely remember paying my $25. Turns out I didnt. 2 hours into a first date, I am in handcuffs, asking her to look after the other 2 beers I brought. There is a small crowd, and right before they cart me off I blurt our ""soo,, I guess I will call you?"" WINK. 

EDIT: My roommate (sitting across from me) just told me that her friend sent her this link not knowing it was me. I feel like its going to get back to the OKC date. Reddit always finds a way ... 



"
2k3uav,non_TBI,"There was a nor'easter in my area last night. For those of you not from New England, that means high winds and lots of precipitation. Usually, these storms come with snow, but this time it's rain.

Because of the time of year, there were lots of clogged drains and sewers because of all the leaves. Because of the wind electricity was out in some areas and very few of the traffic lights were fully operational (the were mostly blinking yellow or red.)

My GPS app (waze) told me to take some back roads since the highway I usually go on was backed up, most likely due to flooding. 

Lots of roads are blocked off with police barriers or just jammed because of the traffic lights not working. I get rerouted to a road with a big puddle. I didn't know how big it was but some cars were driving through it, so I thought I could too.

Half way down the street the water is getting deeper, I'm committed now. I don't stop, I pictured myself a pioneer on the Oregon Trail attempting to ford the river. 

Much like the Orgegon Trail game, something goes wrong. The car stalls, water starts seeping in through the floor and doors. Luckily I waved down a truck behind me and got him to push me out into a parking lot. 

The tow truck came and the driver confirmed the car hydrolocked. The car will probably be totaled when the insurance adjusted comes to see it next Monday. 

I got to walk in the rain to the train station to get to work. I'm cold and soaking wet and probably need a new car. Not a great start to my birthday, but I get to post on /r/TIFU, so I got that going for me."
3canlh,non_TBI,"My girlfriend's phone stopped working and the replacement turned out to be a piece of crap. Her brother offered to send his old phone as a replacement. We live away from home because of university. Delivering things to my parents' house feels safer. We already did that a few times. So we decided to let them know something was coming with the mail.  
  
I decided to give my mother a heads up with a text. So I texted: ""Girlfriend is expecting a package."" not thinking anything of it. My mother didn't respond and again I thought nothing of it. She does that often.  
  
However when I came home 2 weeks later I learned that she had been panicking the whole time. She thought I knocked up my girlfriend. She demandend an explanation. I gave one and laughing ensued.  
  
So as a bonus I learned that my mother thinks I'm capable of getting my girlfriend pregnant and announcing it through text with a shitty pun.

**TL;DR**: I texted my mother and she thought I knocked up my girlfriend. 

Edit: According to my girlfriend I'm wrong because it was 2 days and not 2 weeks.

Edit 2: Thanks to [/u/IsThisNew](https://www.reddit.com/user/IsThisNew) for narrating my story! "
2kda0u,non_TBI,"I should start this off by saying I work at a school for children with special needs, developmental delays, and Autism.   One of our student's biggest reinforcers (things she works for, or can trade in for) is a burger king crown.   She gets to wear the crown, and for five minutes she is the princess and gets to do whatever she wants, within reason.   Unfortunately her crown broke, so I made it a point to get one for her as soon as I could.

So the other day, I was at a job interview for a new position within my company.  I dressed up all fancy like in a nice black suit and tie. I made sure to stop at burger king to get a crown, then I get on my way home and jump on the highway.  At this point I see out my rear view mirror a pull up next to the car behind me, and this kid sticks his head out the window with a burger king crown on.  He then gives the metal hands/rock on sign to the car next to him.  The car drove by me, and I look inside to see only what can be described as a car full of stoned 19 year olds.  They all had long hair, looked scraggly, they were laughing and listening to reggae.   They ignored me (probably because I was dressed all dapper), and again, pulled up next to the car in front of me, and the kid stuck his head out the window with a burger-king crown on yelling / gesturing to the car in front of me.

It is then that I realize I still have my burger king crown in my car for one of the students I work with.   Perfect.   I've had my stoned shenanigans in the past, so I thought these kids would get a kick out of it if a guy in a suit does the same exact thing to them.

I put on my burger king crown and maneuver right up next to their car, and roll my window down.   Holding the crown on with my hand, I stick my head out the window and give them a metal rock on sign with my other hand with a nod.

They FREAK. THE FUCK. OUT.  The whole car is laughing and cannot believe their eyes.  I think I saw an actual ""mind blown"" moment there. The guy in their car with the burger king crown happened to be in the passenger seat, and in a moment of incredulity, throws his body back into the driver in laughter.   This caused the driver to swerve into the guard rail next to him, fucking up the side of his car.   WOOPS.  My apologies stoner dudes.  I hope the story of the guy in a suit with a burger king crown was worth it.   Luckily no other cars were involved, and nobody was hurt.  



"
3j6h91,non_TBI,"This happened minutes ago:

My wife is a graduate assistant at a major university in our state. This semester is her first teaching two sections of 20 students. While fixing her wifi connection I saw that she had an assignment open in another window. I added the line ""I like dicks. Dicks, dicks, dicks. And vaginas!"" Turns out this assignment was about to be posted to her teaching portal.. And she saved my changes. I forgot about it until one of her students emailed her about it.

On a side note, what are the options for a homeless male in a non metropolitan area? 


*UPDATE* 

The file was only downloaded once, by the student that emailed my wife. She corrected it before anyone else saw it. Yes, I know it was a stupid thing to do, hence the TIFU post. It wasn't emailed directly, so no contaminated files are sitting in any inboxes, so hopefully no more damage will come from this. My wife of course is angry, but she is forgiving (some may consider to a fault in this case.)

*UPDATE 2*

I went to my wife's boss and explained the situation. He was unaware that anything had happened, but assured me that my wife will not be held accountable in any way. Only one student saw the line, the rest did not download until it was fixed."
2p2dt3,non_TBI,"So my girlfriend and I were talking about her upcoming holiday to Japan when she mentions that she's lost a lot of weight from walking a lot at her new job.

But instead what comes out of my mouth is, ""When you get back you'll be fat again."" It took her a second to process what I just said (as did I) and we just fell silent from shock.

3pnw1a,non_TBI,"So at work I had this stapler that made funny squeaking noises when the top lid/part was pressed. My colleague (Bob) really hated the irritating sound of that squeaking. To annoy Bob, I placed the top lid/part between my teeth and was making engine noises. Suddenly I sneezed and tried to pull the stapler out of my mouth but teeth clenched it hard in place and stapled the roof of my mouth. I screamed, Bob screamed, sharp pain, blood dripping and Bob totally freaked out. Everyone around me came running and I was taken to hospital. 

Emergency room doctor looked at me, sitting there with my mouth open like a crocodile, asked Bob what was wrong. Bob explained. Doc shook his head and then proceeded to gently use some blunt scalpel type instrument to pry the staple loose and pull it out. GOD.THAT.PAIN. 

Was given two shots and sent home with some painkillers. Was also told not to put anything in my mouth that didn’t belong there. 

I went home, had nothing but juice for two days because I couldn’t even feel my upper jaw and mouth hurt like hell. 

My conversation with HR after I returned to work days later.


**HR:** ""Please tell us again how did you manage to staple the roof of your mouth?""

**ME:** Is this not covered in my medical? 

**HR:** All your hospital bills have been cleared. We're just concerned about how you got injured and should we be worried about any future incidents.

2ovl75,non_TBI,"So I was back in my home town and  my wife and I went to a nice seafood restaurant with some old friends of mine from high school, and some of their parents.  On the way out of the place, we were all headed through the lobby which narrowed to a hall that was only wide enough for  two people to walk shoulder to shoulder at best.  An older couple was coming in so we stepped out of the way to let them pass.  As we were standing there I gave my wife a loving pat on the ass.  I immediately heard ""wrong ass"" .  One of the girls that came with us, an old girlfriend from school, had somehow switched places with my wife.  What made it worse was it was her husband and her parents were all there.  They had quite a good laugh at my expense while I turned as red as the lobster I had for dinner.  Fuck.  I'll never hear the end of this."
3tm9wq,non_TBI,"this happened about 20 minutes ago

My girlfriend and I had just finished in town, so I walked her home, on the way home we were both being a little flirty. After reaching her house, long story short I had her over the kitchen counter very quickly. About 20 seconds into it we hear rustling coming from the closet, instinctively, I pulled out, zipped up. 

She opens the closet and out falls her dad, straight away my stomach drops because he was one of those guys who made it clear I wasn't to touch his daughter anymore than a peck on the cheek, but then in the back of the closet was a woman id never seen before (I knew both parents) and it was pretty obvious that Papa-girlfriend had been doing the naughty naughty with another woman. The dad scrambled to his feet, disregarding the fact that I and his daughter just caught him cheating, and came straight at me, without a second thought I was out the door and down the road, I have no idea what's happened since ive left, im waiting for a reply from my girlfriend, ill keep you all posted.

Tl/dr: got intimate with gf, shortly interrupted by gf's cheating dad, I didnt get to finish. 

Update 1: nothing yet, it's pretty late though, if she hasn't replied by the morning I may go over make sure she's ok 

Update 2: first things first, apologies for the shitty grammar and punctuation, ive always been bad at that. 
Girlfriends mom knows and apparently shits going down at their house, im getting ready to leave my house now and head over for a 'family + boyfriend discussion' I don't think I'll get hurt. 

Extra info for clarity: 
- Girlfriend and I are 18 we both live with our parents until uni starts next Sept. 
- Her dad is a lot bigger than me, I wasn't gonna stay around and get my head kicked in, I knew he wouldn't hurt his daughter, he may be a scumbag, but he's one of those dad's who loves his daughter to much to hurt them. Ngl, her wellbeing wasn't my first thought when he ran at me 
- Mystery woman was in fact a coworker of the dad. 
- I didnt get bummed by her dad 
- I'm not one for blackmail, I would've had to come clean no matter what, even if gf hadn't said anything. 

Update 3: I just left her house, basically, her moms furious at her dad (obviously) but she's 'not surprised'  at mine and her daughters actions, not sure what she's tryna say about me. the dad didn't speak to me the entire time, awkward af between us. Girlfriend Is also furious at her dad but assures me nothing will change between me and her. 
for the best I think the parents are going to decide what happens between them over the next few days. The mom is currently trying to get in touch with the other woman, I wish I could be there for that call but gf will keep me posted on how that goes.

2f04z2,non_TBI,"I was visiting So. Cal with my girlfriend of two years and we decided to make a trip to Disneyland for the day. That morning, she had packed us a nice lunch with lots of veggies and healthy shit. I had no objection to eating healthy for once, as the majority of my meals in LA consisted of Taco Bell and In-N-Out (I'm Canadian so I have to take advantage of this whenever possible)

Throughout this vacation, her and I constantly made back-and-forth jokes about our shitty eating habits and how we had left our healthy lifestyles back at home. 

Well, that morning, she packs a big bag of spinach for us to munch on. Spinach is my favorite healthy snack. However, she did not take into account the fact that it would be sitting in the bottom of her backpack, squished by the weight of other various fooditems, for several hours in the Anaheim heat.

So I'm standing in line for the Indiana Jones ride, it's about 5 o'clock and I'm starting to feel snackish. So I reach into her backpack and pull out this gnarly looking bag of spinach. Most of the leaves had already turned into that flaccid combination of very dark green/brown pulp, not appetizing at all. 

Feeling disappointed, I turn to my girlfriend and say jokingly, ""Everyone here should just leave their vegetables at home. They have no reason to be at a place like this."" She laughed and my heart melted a little bit.

""EXCUSE ME?!?!?!?""

I turn around and a mother with her severely disabled daughter is standing right behind me in line. Both are wearing bright orange shirts with some charity's logo on it and ""DISNEYLAND 2014"" in boldface across the chest. Then I look behind them. There is a large group of people wearing the same shirts. And they all have the same expression of disgust on their faces.

""My daughter is not a vegetable! She is the sweetest, kindest thing ever! Yatta yatta yatta. How DARE you tell me where I can and can't take my own child!""

Realizing what she thought I meant, I quickly tried to cover up my ass. 

""Oh no. No. No. No. I didn't mean it that way! I was just referring to this rotten bag of spinach!""

""WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL HER?""

I pull out the bag of spinach from the backpack. One of the guys from the group walks up to me and says ""You think you're funny? Try taking care of a child with cerebral palsy, let alone suffer from it! I'm sure you wouldn't be fucking laughing.""

Before giving me another chance to explain myself, he walks between my girlfriend and I as to cut off our spot in line. Then he signals for the rest of the group to walk right by us. I had already waited in line for approximately 40 minutes, and now a group of 20+ people felt they had the right to budge us in line because of a simple misunderstanding. 

""What do you think you're doing?"" I ask him

""We're going on this ride before you.""

""What gives you the right to do that?""

""You fucking insulted my niece, that's what!""

My girlfriend is telling me to let it go, but I'm not letting this douchebag get away with this. So I walk ahead to the front of the group to reassert our position in line. The mother says ""no, you're gonna have to wait in line like everybody else."" 

WTF? 

I suddenly felt a hand on my shoulder. People from the group were forcefully pushing me to the back of the line. My brain was about to explode from the absurdness of the situation. Without thinking, I immediately turned around and swung at the douchebag who cut us off, hitting him square in the jaw. By this time, the rest of the people in line were watching us. 

My girlfriend rushed over and pulled me out of there before I heard one of the ladies from the group scream ""I NEED A CAST MEMBER!""

Two park employees came running up to us asking what all the commotion was. The mother of the handicapped girl told them how we had PERSONALLY insulted her child, as well as other disabled children in general. Then they said that I had tried taking their place in line because I thought their group was too large. THEN the one d-bag showed the staff his swollen cheek, saying how I turned violent when I wouldn't return to my place in line. That part was true, but the way he explained it to them made it seem like I went Marsellus Wallace on his ass.

Then I told them my side of the story. They didn't believe it. A nice cast member by the name of Carl escorted us out of the park. I am now banned from all Disney parks for life.

We went to Knott's the next day without any incident or vegetables.

TLDR; my spinach went bad, some crazy woman assumed I was insulting her disabled daughter and I am now no longer allowed to visit the Happiest Place on Earth.

edit 1: The staff at Disney showed us the footage of the incident before we were escorted out. I did punch another man in the face, and that's probably the main reason why I am banned. I fucked up there but I choose not to dwell on it.

3skevx,non_TBI,"This didn't happen today, but I didn't have internet or reddit when this happened. I feel like sharing it with you.

When I was really young I used to think that there were 2 types of diseases: the ones that can kill me and the ones that won't kill me. The ones that could kill me were the ones that I saw my mom being seriously worried about. Between them, cancer and pneumonia.

Eventually, when I was around 7 or 8, I became sick. I had bacterial pneumonia. My mom got worried. As a consequence, I automatically thought I had a killing-tier disease.

The next day at school I could only think about the possibility I could die at any moment. I felt obliged to tell my friends I was sick, but I couldn't remember the word ""pneumonia"". As it was a killing-tier disease, I thought that calling it ""cancer"" would have the same impact. As you can imagine, it didn't.

All my friends told their parents I had cancer. A shitstorm proceeded to happen. During the following days, my mom received several calls from parents trying to share some hope and strength with her. When she went to school to pick me up, people would stop her to talk about my condition.

My mom had to spend several hours of shame explaining to people how stupid her son was.

One week later I was healthy again and glad I wasn't dead.

I'm an identical twin. My brother and I look very alike and all my life we've both struggled with people always mixing us up.

At a party one night, I got drunk. Very drunk. Late in the night, someone found me a comfortable spot on the floor and let me pass out. 

The next morning, I woke up, feeling quite disorientated. I saw my brother lying next to me. He was also awake.

""Hey! Where are we?"" I said.

I quickly realised I was talking to my reflection and I'd passed out next to a mirror.

2x8gs5,non_TBI,"My housemate and I have been friends for ~20 years, and constantly prank each other. 

Early this morning I quietly came home from my overnight shift and heard him in his bedroom. Knowing he was home without him knowing I was home was the perfect opportunity to do something funny. So I took my glasses off (that's important), pulled my shirt up over my head like a mask, and jumped into his open bedroom door with a running start. He was in his bed.

""TIME TO DIE BITCH!"" I yelled.

No response.

I used my best 90's action movie villain voice. ""What's wrong sweetheart?....cat got your tongue? Bwahaha!""

Still no response.

""How about a kiss for daddy?""

The toilet flushed in his bathroom behind me. If this was a movie, there would have been a dolly zoom on my face. I pulled my t-shirt down and put my glasses back on to find my housemate's girlfriend, who just spent her first night over, sitting on his bed with the blankets pulled up to her neck. She was absolutely terrified.

I slowly backed out while muttering incoherently, went into my bedroom, and laid down on the ground face first to hide my embarrassment from the world. I am truly a fuck up.


Edit: Never seen my housemate so gleeful. All he had to do was take a dump and I did all the work in making an ass out of myself infront of company. The g/f is fine and commented that my karate game was a bit weak (I threw a few shadow chops when I first ran in)

Edit: Yes, I realize he could have swiss-cheesed me with a shotgun...."
2tlw99,non_TBI,"This happened tonight while I was out having a beer with a friend from work. I live on Guam and we get a ton of Japanese tourists through here. It's like Japan's Mexico.  Today was especially hot (about 93*f), so I was wearing a tank top shirt that exposes a tattoo on my left arm.

In walks a Japanese couple obviously on vacation. The man spoke pretty good english and decided the bar was a perfect place to practice his english, so he asks me, ""What tattoo on yo arm-uh mean?""

I told him, ""Oh this? My grandpa worked on the flight crew for a B-17 bomber in WW2. This is the pinup from his bomber jacket.""

After it came out of my mouth and the look on the guys face...I don't know the word for the emotion his face showed...I realized what I had said.  He just exchanged a few words with his female friend and they both dourly walked out of the bar into the night.

Guys, I have never felt so bad for something I've said in my life."

When I was ten years old, daddy knocked mommy up for the 5th time.  Another brother!?  Yes, please!

About 8 months into the pregnancy, my mom approaches me and asks if I'd like to be present for the birth.  Hell yes, I respond, I'm all about science!  Up to this point in my life, I was under the distinct impression that all babies were birthed via C-section, so I'm pumped.  For the next few weeks, I am a damn angel; I knew I had been chosen because my parents deemed me ""mature enough"" to handle a surgery, and I did not want that free pass to Babytown revoked.  

Fast forward to New Year's Eve, 1996.  Mom is in the hospital, and we are waiting.  No biggie, I got my ""I Can Draw Dinosaurs"" book, a fat stack of blank printer paper, and a handful of Power Rangers pencils.

I'm on my second Triceratops when things start to heat up.  A nurse hands me a little facemask and some latex gloves.  I snap them on and throw her a wink that would make Ellen DeGeneres weak in the knees.  I'm all business now.  I move up to stand beside my mother, but another nurse pulls me back and tells me to stand closer to her feet, behind the...doctor...

Her legs are spreading...

This can't...be..right...

**ABORT!  ABORT!**

Within thirty seconds I'm fumbling for the eject button, but it's too late.  Before I can pray for Promethean goggles, I'm staring straight down the barrel of Mom's baby cannon.  ""Push!"" they urge.  ""Eat shit and die!"" Mom screams.  Now they're going full ham sandwich.  The doctor is reaching into her cheese factory and I view Hell in all its terrible glory, bathed in vernix and the blood of innocents.

Within five minutes it was all over.  The nurses let me poke the placenta with my gloved fingers, but not even that could console me.  I was dead inside.

TLDR: Got punk'd by mommy.

36k68m,non_TBI,"I was at the park with my daughters 6&7.  I assumed my usual position at a bench in the middle of the park that give me a view of the whole park.  I usually sit there until I'm called to push, help or just watch.  I pull out my phone and start playing Mortal Combat X.  

My 7 year old comes over about 10 minutes in and says the boys are saying bad words.  I told her to take her sister and go to the other jungle gym.  A few minutes pass and the boys head over to where my girls and a few others are playing.  The boys are probably 9-10 years old.  Now I hear them cursing and its echoing throughout the park because they are in a plastic slide.  I walk over and say ""YOU GUYS NEED TO WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE"" loud enough for them and any parents to hear.  

Had they been teenagers I would have said a lot worse and probably told them to leave but they were just young kids.  A few seconds later and young lady who I am assuming was one of their mothers comes over and goes apeshit on her kid.  She is yelling and cursing and threatening the kid and his friends/brothers.  The language she was using was 20 times worse than the kids.  

This caused another mother to come over and yell at the yelling mother.  The yelling mother didn't appreciate it and starts going apeshit on the mother too.  Now the father of one lady comes over and starts trying to break it up and the yelling mom goes apeshit on him too.  

Now all of the kids have stopped playing and are watching and all the grown ups are screaming, cursing, threatening each other and threatening to call child services and to call the cops.

Then I got a text that dinner was ready.  I grabbed my girls and walked to the car and they were all still going apeshit.  "
2vhj5f,non_TBI,"It was 1999, the dot-com boom was booming, and I was 23 and eager to make an impression at my new software startup job.    

I had arrived at work on Monday morning to find a full-blown customer crisis that I worked straight through the night into Tuesday afternoon to solve.   Just as I was about to leave on Tuesday, *another* customer crisis erupted, and I settled in for the second-consecutive all-nighter, pleased to have the opportunity to show my dedication.   

So, here comes the f-up.   It is now Wednesday at noon, crisis #2 is finally solved, and I am near-drunk from 2 days of sleep deprivation.  I am also faint from hunger having not eaten since dinner the night before.   My needs are clear: Wendy's drive-through and get home to sleep.   I pull into the Wendy's lot and my heart sinks: huge lunchtime line.   Too groggy to come up with an alternative, I get in line and try futilely to stay awake.   Twice my micro-sleep is interrupted by the couple in the convertible behind me honking to move forward.  That's not the f-up, though, not yet...

Finally, my turn at the window.   The cashier tells me $9.78, which I know isn't right -- my usual grilled chicken combo #4 costs $5.45 -- but I'm too tired to argue.  I take the bag of food and two (2?  wtf!?) drinks she hands me and drive off.

I rip into the bag -- why are there two burgers in here?   Too tired to care, I eat and drive, focused on getting home safely and into my bed.   Blood sugar rising, my zombie-like haze lifts enough to realize what I have done.  I  forgot to order at the drive-through microphone -- I just drove right by.  That's right, I am eating not my own meal, but the meal ordered by the honking couple behind me.  I guess it's not technically stealing since I paid for it?

TL;DR: Drunk with sleep deprivation I skipped ordering and instead took some random couple's order at the drive-through.

"
46c39o,non_TBI,"TL:DR I was scammed into drive to a car dealership 40 miles away.

This happened about three hours ago. I am still very ashamed of myself. 

I got what looked like a scratch off game card in my mailbox that was from a car dealership a couple towns over. It looked like a standard promotion/junk mail and I would normally throw this stuff away but this card had differing amounts that could be won simply by scratching off the various boxes on the card. Well wouldn't you know it, I had a combination of symbols that, on the key on the right side of the card, said I had won $5,000. I then read the fine print on the back of the card and it seemed legit. No red flags to speak of.  

I am normally EXTREMELY skeptical on these types of things. You can't just win free money, right? So I called the number of the dealership and was transferred to a man who acted very excited that I had won this promotion. I asked him point blank, ""Is there anything else that I need to know? Did I really just win $5,000 on a free mailer that everyone gets?"" He said all I have to do is come down to the dealership and match the code on the back of the card. If it matches and I can prove that I live at the address on the mailer, he would cut me a check for the amount that I won. Keep in mind he didn't say ""$5,000"" he said ""Amount that I won"". 

I'll be honest, and I was still skeptical, but I could really use that kind of money right now (I mean who couldn't right?). I basically laid it on the line and said, ""Listen your dealership is at least 45 minutes away. I am not buying a car today. This isn't like cash back on a new car or anything is it? Please tell me this is for real. I cant afford to drive that far both ways if this isn't what you are telling me it is."" Without hesitating, the man on the phone said ""This is for real. If we verify it and you really did win, we will cut you a check today.""     

So, I hopped in my car and drove the 45 minutes to the dealership. When I walked in I saw a few people holding the same mailer. I was suspicious but at the same time there were several levels of money, all the way down to like $25, that could be won according to the game card so I figured these people had some amount of money as well. I walked up to the sales counter and told them who I was. I said, ""Hey I'm the guy that called about an hour ago. I won $5,000 on your mailer game"". The three guys at the counter cheered and congratulated me. One of them ushered me into an office and asked me for my ID and proof that I lived at the address listed. Once I gave him that he asked me for the game card. He then gave me a form to fill out to claim my winnings.  He punched in the code into his computer and said, ""Alright man, lets find out if you won."" ""What do you mean, if I won?"" I said back. ""One of you told me on the phone that I already had won."" I began to shake because I knew I had been tricked, no, straight lied to earlier. This man looks me in the face and says ""You did win. You won a spot in our contest to see if you won $5,000."" I was speechless. He said ""Don't you want to find out if you won the money?"" I realized then that I had been scammed into driving to this dealership. I said nothing. I looked this man in the eyes for at least thirty straight seconds in dead silence. I was so angry I could barely get words out. I am normally a very calm, easy going person and I hate confrontation, but I was so ashamed that I fell for this. I finally said, ""You mother fuckers lied to me. You lied and told me I had won this money. I just drove all the way from (my town) to (this town) because one of you assured me this wasn't a scam to get me here. I asked you if there was anything else I needed to know, if this was for real, and you said it was.""

He responded by saying it wasn't him, that it must have been one of the other employees. He then told me that my drive ""Wasn't really that far"". I lowered my head, got back into my car, and drove home. 

And that is how I fucked up today. I really hope that the son-of-a-bitch that put this together wins a bunch of money in the lotto and then dies of a heart attack before he can collect his winnings. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I did take a picture of this to send to my wife before I left. I will try to post it if It can.

2s3b1u,non_TBI,"When I was 15, (not today but whatevs) whilst I was home alone I discovered masturbating.

For a prudish shy teenage girl, I was totally addicted, but unfortunately lived in a house with 4 siblings and paper thin walls. Online it recommended using the bath tap or shower head.

So, I ran a bath, added a few capfuls of olive oil bc soft skin or whatever, and lowered myself in.

Now I have advice for anybody masturbating with a bath tap for the first time.

1. Don't fucking put the tap on full blast.
 I swear to God I came straight away, to the extent where my stomach was pulsing and I couldn't see. I hit my leg off the tap where it was burning hot, I don't know even what kind of noises I was making. Thought it was a fit smh

2. Don't put oil in the fucking bath.
After I was done, I stood up and had no idea about the jelly legs. This combined with the already slippery bath meant I fell, hit my stomach off the bath, winded myself and my head on the ground. I remember lying there for a couple of minutes, just looking at the floor. I genuinely thought my family was going to find me dead, naked, and oily.

3. Make sure your parents aren't in the bedroom beside the bathroom.
To this day I have no idea if they heard me, I can't remember if I made any noises, although I'm pretty certain I did. All I know is I left the bathroom redfaced and winded.

TL;DR: Masturbated with the water jet for the first time, was punished by Jesus for sinning.

edit: holy shit so many creeps. yes i put olive oil in the bath makes u so silky smooth try it. thank u, this is my first post n shit blew up!!"
3ldtu1,non_TBI,"In my humanities class we had just finished reading ""The Scarlet Letter"". Tldr the book? A woman is caught committing adultery and has to wear a scarlet, gold-embroidered patch of cloth in the shape of an “A” at all times. A major theme of the book is that the main character is being punished for her sin and secrecy. 

""Ah, secrecy--that sounds like a good buzzword to bullshit my entire paper around. How about I take it one step classier and term the theme of this paper...secretion. ""

I think you know where this is going. I got my paper back about a week later to find that I was given a C. My teacher left a note at the top saying ""That word does not mean what you think it means"" and had circled every time I used any form of ""secretion"" or ""secreted"" throughout the paper. Apparently Hester Prynne, the main character, did not secrete her identity from anyone. Secretion was not the most potent theme of the novel. Annnnnnd Hester Prynne did not feel pressured by society to secrete anything.

2y2riw,non_TBI,"So, a little backstory: 

I live in a nice neighborhood where all of the families are fucked up, husbands drink and cheat on wives, wives pop  xanax and cheat on husbands, children become entitled and  everybody pretty much hates eachother.. Typical Suburban neighborhood. So every summer, one weekend, I throw a Barbeque/pool party where half of the neighborhood drinks all the booze I buy and eat all of the food I cook then get drunk, pass out on the floor, then I cook them breakfast in the morning and then they leave. 

Well, the life of the party was always my neighbor(let's call him B). B worked in finances and was loaded. About a year ago, B's wife informed me that B beat her and their son alot. (Oh by the way their son is 24, still living at home, never had a job.[entitled]). So I gave her and her son a copy of the key to my house so if B was being abusive to either of them, they would have a safe haven. 

Fast forward to now: B's wife divorced him and basically bled his bank account and stocks dry and now B's wife (lets call her A) is a single mom, with more money than she can spend, living with her son(let's call him WTF). 

Last week, I had to go out of town for business and since I am single with no kids and I have 4 cats, I needed someone to house sit for me. So I hired WTF to feed my cats for the 3 days I would be gone. 

The day I returned, I caught an earlier flight and arrived home around 2pm, whereas I was supposed to arrive at 10pm. I enter my home and my garage is filled with cigarette smoke, my counter had prescription drugs sitting on it, right next to lines of cocaine, and music was blaring out of my entertainment system. 
I walk upstairs to my room, and the bedspread is all haywire. I change my clothes and decide to look to see if WTF was even in the house. I walk downstairs to the theater room and I see the back of his head, as if he was simply watching a movie. Except he wasn't. I walk over to chew him out and possibly strangle him, and he is (and this is the WTF WTF part) dressed in women's clothes, masturbating, whilst he has a dildo the size of texas inside of him. 

I walk away.

I walk back 5 minutes later and rip the Dr Dre Beats off of his fucking skull and tell him to get the fuck out of my house and take his drugs with him.

He left.

I clean my house, air out my garage, sanitize the fuck out of every god damn room.

The next day, I receive a text from A. ""Hey. WTF told me that you were mean to him when you got back. Why?"".
I explain in great detail what happened. 
She doesn't reply. 

I haven't heard from either of them.


tl;dr Paid some man-child to house sit for me, arrived at my house to the place trashed and him crossdressing/masturbating on my leather couches.

380jyw,non_TBI,"First off this happened 15 years ago. I was 14 years old at the time and after a long day at school being surrounded by the opposite sex and festering in a pool of my own raging hormones I rushed home to release some 'stress'. I remember vaguely after walking in the house my mother saying something about having an early dinner. I acknowledged her, planted my backpack at the edge of the stairs, ran up to my room and locked the door. Now mind you, I had a strange door knob. Instead of your standard ""push button door knob lock"" mine had to have the whole door knob pushed in and than cocked to the right to be locked. It was a poor design ( I don't think they even make them anymore) and very difficult to lock. 

Anyways, on with my humiliation. I was fortunate enough to have my own computer in my room. My parents didn't know the dangers of the internet back then and I wasn't inclined to be the one to tell them. As far as my parents knew I was playing video games and messing around with AOL. This being the days of dial up, internet porn wasn't anything like the way it is today. There weren't very many videos (and if there were they'd take forever to load) there was mostly pics, and even those took some time to load back then. So there I am in the dark ( I had the blinds closed and a blanket covering my window)  shirt off and pants around my ankles sitting in my computer chair choking my bishop. I find a pic that I like, click on it and let the loading commence. With every pixel that slowly loads I can feel myself growing closer to finishing. When the picture finally fully loads I sit back and gaze with sinful eyes. I can feel myself about to finish when my FATHER WHIPS OPEN THE DOOR AND SAYS: ""Son, dinner's rea-"". I literally came at the same time he opened the door, as he was saying ""Son, dinner's ready"" my boyhood was shooting into the air and down onto my chest and stomach. The worse part was for a brief moment my father and I locked eyes. For what seemed like an eternity, for which in reality was only half a second, the door quickly slammed closed. 

There I sat, covered in my own shame. I quickly cleaned myself up and reluctantly headed down stairs. I was relived to find my father at the head of the table acting as if nothing happened. My mother was bringing things out from the kitchen and from what I could tell had no idea what had just transpired up stairs. I sat myself at the opposite end of the table and my father looked up at me. He had asked my this same question since I was a child almost every time before we ate a family dinner. Except this time it had a little more sarcasm behind it. He said: ""Son, Did you wash your hands?""

TL;DR: I was teenager, didn't lock the door right and came in front of my dad."
41e50k,non_TBI,"This just happened 2 minutes ago.

I was trying out anal for the first time on my own, on the basis that my straight male friend said it was amazing.  I had a dildo from a joke birthday gift, 8-inches jelly dong.

So I'm putting it in and I push it past the second sphincter which didn't really hurt much, and suddenly I lose grip on it.

I try to push and reach it to get it out but it's stuck past the sphincter.  At this point I start to panic, mostly because I'm leaving for an 8 hour flight in roughly 5 hours, and message my homosexual internet friend for advice, while making posts on two internet forums and /r/sexadvice .

He recommends me the squatty potty (google it) which after a minute of relaxing and then decently hard pushing, yields the 8-inch dildo.

So yeah, TLDR; Lost a dildo past second sphincter, gay friend gave shitting advice and I got it out."
2l5p1v,non_TBI,"I am the pastor of a mainline church in a small town (around 3,000 people) in the American Midwest. In America, yesterday was Daylight Savings Time, when we move the clock back by one hour. 

Our church has one of those carillon bell systems that chimes the hour, plays music, etc. Our is relatively un-annoying though, as it only plays twice a day: noon and six p.m. 

Yesterday morning, I was in the middle of my sermon when the bell begins to toll an hour early. Crap. Forgot to set that clock back. Oh, well, finish preaching, walk up to the balcony and change the 12 back to 11. Good, right? I go about the rest of my day, doing visitation and having meetings, not thinking anything else about it.....until I'm woken up at midnight by the tolling of the bells. 

The first ten seconds, I'm trying to figure out if it's our church or the Catholic church across town. Nope, way too loud to be them. Why are our bells going off now? Oh, no. When I changed the 12 to 11, I didn't change it from PM to AM. They're off by twelve hours! 

For the second ten seconds, I'm thinking ""Ok, fine. Just twelve tolls and then it's done."" Until my wife asks, ""Does this mean it's going to play the ten minutes of music it does at noon?"" ""SHIT!"" 

At this point, I'm up and running. Throw on pants, dive in the car and drive the two block to church. Run into the building, through the sanctuary, up the stairs to the balcony, (tripping in my slippers the entire way), and confront the bell system.....only to find it's apparently in lockdown mode while playing. 

This is one of those cold nights where sound carries forever. The church sits on a hill at the very center of town, so everyone in our city is hearing this. Dogs are starting to bark. 

However, I stare dumbly at the panel for the next 60 seconds or so. These systems are VERY expensive. The only way to stop this one playing now is to unplug it mid-song, and I have no idea what this is going to do to this system. Finally, as it begins to play ""Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus"" merrily to a small, waking town, I pull the plug. 

I plugged it back in, waited for it to boot, then fixed the time. Went back to my car and drove home, looking for people glaring out their windows at me. The next morning, I'm now waiting for two things: complaints to be made, and for noon to arrive to see if I broke the bells. 

EDIT: Sorry, walked away from this not realizing anyone would actually care. The bells played as normal at noon. No one has called to complain YET. 

As to the ""OMG, that's annoying at noon"" complaints. The church sits dead center of the town at the main intersection. The fire department and police stations are across the street. Semis are constantly clanking through the intersection. The grade school is down the street. We're even on a river, so there's a fair amount of noise from boat traffic. Those bells are BY FAR not the loudest thing going in town during the day. Besides, I'm a relatively young pastor (in my 30's). These things were installed around the year I was born. It's not like I ring the damn things myself. 

EDIT #2: Thanks for the gold! I only have a vague idea of what it is, but it's appreciated anyway!"
3mc92b,non_TBI,"On New Year's Eve 2012, my girlfriend of six months and I were about to leave her parents house to go to Boston. Her parents were about to go Cape Cod. It's important to note that her Dad didn't like me yet for no reason other than I was banging his daughter.

I take a quick poop upstairs before we all leave. Clogged it. I re-flushed in hopes it would work the second time. The water overflows all over the wooden floor. I frantically start cleaning it up with a couple towels when I hear my girlfriend scream from the kitchen directly under me, ""Mom! Water is coming through the light fixtures!"" They all rush upstairs and GF's mom asks to be let in to help me. I open the door to the scene of a flooded floor and one pathetic nugget swirling around in the top of the bowl. The worst part was her sweetheart mother (who is a nurse) insisted on cleaning it up. Her Dad escaped to the car without saying a word to anyone. 

We're still together. Her dad likes me now.

EDIT: I know I should have turned the water valve off but I panicked. If I was on home turf I would have averted this crisis. "
35fmfc,non_TBI,"Only my luck would let this happen a day before Mother's day.  

I was in Macy's shopping for a mother's day gift for my mom, and while I was in a text conversation with her regarding stuff she'd ""always wanted"" (yeah there are no surprise gifts in my family), my girlfriend Molly started sexting me.  It was really weird being in a serious conversation with my mom and at the same time responding to my very inconveniently timed horny girlfriend.  I responded to Molly a few times as I tried to gather myself and focus on choosing a gift for my mom.  

Unfortunately, both my mom and Molly were texting me at the same time.    I don't know how I lost focus of which text conversation I pressed on, but I was *sure* that I chose Molly's conversation.  I was wrong.  I sent that fateful text as I checked out at the register and was paying for my purchase.  

Immediately after I sent it, I saw that I had one unread message from Molly at 3:42 (it was 3:56 pm).  I yelled out a huge ""OH SHIT!!!"" right in the store.  The entire area by the checkout counters became dead silent for about four seconds.  Everyone just stared at me for those four fucking long seconds.  I immediately jolted out the store.

My mom is a REALLY religious Christian, and she doesn't even know I have a girlfriend (it's *very* frowned upon in my family unless it's for marriage), so it's not like she could even have guessed who that text was meant for.

It's been one hour.  I haven't heard back from my mom yet.  I am scared to go home.  FML.




**[UPDATE] 8:50 pm:** After wandering aimlessly FOR FOUR HOURS holding that 30+ lb set of kitchenware (my arms are freakin' killing me!!), my dad sends me a text ""Come home please.  Your mother and I need to discuss college options with you.""   'College options' my ass!!   That topic's never been brought up yet, *EVER*!  My bones are shaking from just the thought of the awkwardness that is about to ensue......   Goddammmitt....




**[UPDATE] 1:45 pm (Sunday):**  Okay, so I finally gathered the courage to go home after like 6 hours of freaking out.  I got home at around 11 or so last night and sitting right in the living room were both my parents and the priest from my church!!!  They started preaching to me and quoting passages from the bible.  OMG!!  My head was spinning.  It was PURE torture!!  Fucking nightmare.  They even said that ""they reached a unanimous decision that I should see a psychologist. and that there is always hope for cases like mine"".....  WHAT THE MOTHERFUCKING FUCK????????  I couldn't gather the strength to *even talk*, let alone execute any of the strategies described below.  Long story short I got grounded and my cellphone was confiscated ""until further notice"".  I wasn't even allowed to go to church with them today (*finally*), because ""until I get my head straight, I should not be in a holy place of worship"".... Currently my phone is taken away.  I have no idea where it is.  Maybe I'll go look for it.  My parents are at church anyways right now...  They won't be home for another 2 hours at least.


**[UPDATE] 3:13 pm:**  I went looking for my phone in my dad's closet while my parents are at church.  I found my phone in this box he apparently keeps random stuff in.  [YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT ELSE I FOUND IN THERE!!](http://imgur.com/R0msJzA)  Okay, so that may not be so crazy to the rest of you, but to *my* family that is a HUGE no-no!!!  My parents are so unbelievably against birth control of any form, and consider others who use it to be sinners.  OMG OMG OMG!!!! The tables have turned like crazy right now.....  I'm wondering if I should use this leverage now, or wait until a different situation occurs (because this one is pretty much over)???  This is insane leverage I have on my parents!!"
2brs5t,non_TBI,"So I work in a kitchen.  People move fast and very often have sharp or searing hot things in their hands. As a safety measure we say ""Behind you!"" as we pass by to cut down on accidents.

I was walking home from work at around 4 am.  I see a woman walking the same direction as I am, I appear to be moving a fair amount faster.  I've been told I make little to no noise as I walk, so I suppose she didn't hear me, but as I went to pass her I nonchalantly said ""behind you"" on reflex.  She must have jumped a foot in the air, screamed at the top of her lungs, and sprinted off.

I hope she's not scarred for life O.o"
3u7imn,non_TBI,"Didn't actually happen today, but rather a few weeks ago. 
I had been growing ghost peppers in my garden all summer to use in salsa and stuff like that and when fall came around I had a lot left over. 
One night, when I had some friends over, they saw the peppers and begged me to give them some so they could see how spicy they were. I initially refused but a few days later decided to bring a few in to lunch (because I thought it would be funny). 
So first I give a pepper to friend #1, telling him to start slow with a little piece, and he proceeds to eat almost the entire pepper. Within a few minutes he's running around the lunchroom with a completely Red face saying he feels it in his ears. Funniest shit ever. Then a different friend who is Indian and eats spicy food all the time asks for one and I'm like hell yeah that was funny. So he eats the entire thing and basically has the same reaction. At this point the teachers are noticing two kids running around and acting like crazy people so I get the hell out of there and go to my next class. 
I later found out that after I left, a different classmate (who's a huge idiot) took the peppers and tried to lace other people's drinks by rubbing the seeds in there. Karma got the best of him as he accidentally got the residue in his eyes and spent the rest of the day in the nurses office and ended up with detention while nobody else got in trouble. 
So now I'm know around campus as the stupid guy who brought in ghost peppers. 

Edit: A lot of people are arguing that this was a win for me. In some ways it was but it also created some inconveniences for me; my school is pretty strict and it took some maneuvering to not get in trouble. Some teachers/parents don't respect me as much and I had to deal with the wrath of my parents who were furious (not fun). I wasn't quite sure where to post this but this subreddit seemed like a decent place to share the story"
2wjeue,non_TBI,"First off, I am happily married with a kid, and I'm completely naive. 

I have back problems. Once and a while it gets really bad and sometimes the only way to relieve my pain is by using a jacuzzi. I don't own one. It was really killing me today.  So I looked around for a spa with a jacuzzi.  I find one. It's in the middle of the Korean section of town. I think, ""Great. It's like the public bath houses in Korea."" 

Go in pay the money. Everything seems cool. Take off my clothes put a towel around my waist, wash and get in the jacuzzi. A few people say, ""hi"". I notice some of the guys are middle eastern but most are asian. It is clear that the Asian people are the regulars.

I'm feeling relaxed, and back is feeling much better. I decide to have a look around. There's a sauna room. It's completely dark, but I think, ""Hey. I hate bright lights when I'm trying to relax."" 

I look around some more and find a lounge room. Two guys are sitting in there. I sit a little ways away. I'm watching the TV but notice one puts his arm around the other guy. I don't think much of it. I tell my self, ""eh they're probably a couple."" I leave because I don't like PDAs.

So I go into the sauna because I love the heat. Big mistake. It was dark for a reason. Some dude is giving another dude a blowjob while another guy was watching. 

I'm not a homophobe. If this was a hetero sex club I would have noped the fuck out of there just as fast.

I skip the shower you should have before you leave a spa. And I walk to go change into my clothes. As I change my clothes an Asian guy is changing next to me. He says, ""Kind of a disappointment today. See all the dark young guys, but they don't want anything."" 

I nervously laugh and say, ""Yeah. Right."" WTF? I'm worried this guy is going to think I'm not into dudes. Like if he figures out I'm not gay/bi he's going to screech like in Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I take my key to the front desk, don't say bye to the attendant and speed all the way home to take a shower.

~~I'm all freaked out now. My family would probably disown me if there was even a rumor that I went into a gay bath house while being married. My face is on all the cameras outside the building. I don't think I'll ever tell my wife. But~~ I'm worried one day that a picture will show up somewhere  of me going into a gay bath house.

TL;DR: Google led me to a gay bath house.

UPDATE: Will Probably Tell My Wife. Thank you Internet for making me less stressed. You are my non-sex club spa.

UPDATE 2: Talked with the wife over breakfast.  She went from  confused to ""WTF why did you say, 'Yeah. Right.'?"" to ""OK"". Thought she was a little pissed. Waited in akward silence for a about 30 sec. Then she asked, ""Did anyone have a better looking butt  than me?"" I knew we were all right.

CLARIFICATION: My wife was not angry. Her WTF was more bewilderment at the fact that I said, ""Yeah. Right."" and that the fact that sex clubs exist. She's from the middle east.

FURTHER CLARIFICATION: Nobody has a natural booty as good as my wife does. Nobody."
3cq0go,non_TBI,"A couple months ago there was this AskReddit post about products you use that are intended for the opposite gender. I read something about these nasal pore strips, and how satisfying it is to see what they remove from your skin. Having never have heard of these strips, I continued reading curiously. It was mentioned that these strips are very expensive, but that you can put glue on your nose, let it dry, and peel it off for the same effect. 

Not really sure why, but I gave it a go. Once it dried, I peeled it off and examined the glue. It appeared as though nothing came out of my pores. I wasn't really disappointed, I just didn't care. The next morning I woke up with a pimple on my nose where the glue had been. I looked like Rudolph. It was the kind of zit that causes a throbbing, distracting pain. With each pulsation I cursed at that damn Reddittor under my breath. 

The next day I woke up and noticed it was even bigger, redder, and more painful. Fed up, I tried to pop it, but to no avail. 

The following day, the redness had spread up my face into my eyes. One was completely swollen shut. So I went to the doctor and they gave me some antibiotics. After a couple days of the medication, I was not getting any better, so I went to urgent care. 

I was diagnosed with MRSA in the face and admitted for a week stay at the hospital for constant IV Antibiotics and 4 incisions in my nose. I was told that if I had come a day later, it would have likely spread to my brain and I would have either died or suffered brain damage. 

I now have a scar on my nose. Fuck you, redditor. 

TLDR followed redditor's advice, got MRSA in the face, almost died."
38pz7a,non_TBI,"Sit back, read and enjoy my misfortune.

Today was my 25th birthday, my friends invited me over to hang out. I get all dressed up to head over to my friends place.

As I get there, I need to pee. I hadn't been feeling well for the last couple of days so as I am peeing, I need to fart...

So I do... but its not. Liquid poop, my jeans immediately are soaked and I reach back to check and raise my wet, poopy hand to my face to smell...

yes, it is in fact poop...

Like a small part of me had hoped it would be water off a bush or something else.

I panic, 25 years old and up until today could say, ""I have never actually shit myself."" well not anymore.

I do what anyone would do and drive home in shame, well little did I know that all my friends were inside ready to surprise me as I came inside the door at their house. I literally drove away from my surprise party.

For some reason, I had a bathrobe in my car so I wrapped myself in that (my jeans were drenched) and climbed into my car.

As I am driving home, next thing I see red and blue lights... ""Are you fucking kidding me..."", I pull over. Cop approaches window, leans in and immediately reels back. ""What the fuck is that smell?""

Now I'll be honest... as a 25 year old man, I started crying.

Me ""I'M... sob... I'm... sob... SO SORRY BUT... officer, I uh... sob shit myself.""

Cop ""You what..?""

Me ""I pooped myself, man...""

Cop ""You are serious?""

Me ""Yes sir.""

Cop ""How old are you sir?""

Me ""I'm 25... its my birthday and I pooped myself.""

Cop ""Um... hold on a minute here, I'll try get you on your way.""

Cop disappears for a few minutes, I assume getting the last laugh out as he tells his buddies then comes back

Cop ""Alright sir, you have a good night.""

Me ""Uh... sob I'll try, sir.""

Cop ""Well shit son, not like it can get any worse... Sometimes, shit happens.""

TLDR - Went to pee before a surprise party, tried to fart and shit my pants. Drove home and got pulled over by a cop, made fun of my shitty situation. 0/10 would not recommend


EDIT - Holy fuck, did not expect this to blow up. Few things. 

1. Went to friends house (where surprise party was)


2. Went to pee in bushes near house before going inside


3. Went to fart, shit myself


4. Left house (where they were waiting) and drove home.


5. Got pulled over, made fun of by cop


6. Got home, found out next day I missed my party. Sad.


And to whoever gave me gold, What the fuck? Donate to some charity or something next time not some dude with too much trust in his butthole. 


Also 7. I had ""Herb"" in the car as well, forgot to mention. Contributed to my ""Oh, fuck I'm going to jail covered in shit."" crying.


8. I apologize for the layout and writing of the story, I am bad and should feel bad."
2lzp04,non_TBI,"This actually happened two weeks ago and before you start thinking I made this up let me just say that I didn't just go up to the CEO and say this out of nowhere. It was completely accidental and just the worst luck imaginable.........

I've worked at this place for a little over 2 years. I don't want to mention the name of the company but it is a major, probably the largest, pharmacy/convenience store company in the country. They have stores everywhere. I was a cashier and on this particular day I was working the afternoon shift. It was around 5:30 in the afternoon and pretty slow in the store. 

So I was in the middle of restocking the shelves (for anybody that's never worked a retail job that's what you do when you're the cashier and there are no customers to ring up). I was stocking the shelves in the alcohol aisle when I saw a customer walk into the aisle and start browsing our alcohol selection. It's worth noting that I noticed this customer was wearing a nice suit and tie and seemed to be some sort of businessman but didn't think anything of it at the time. As I was trained to do I walked up to him and politely said ""Anything I can help you with today sir?"" And he responded ""Nope"" which I think was a little rude but I didn't care so I told him just to let me know if he needed me for anything and just went back to stocking shelves. 

Now here's where it starts to get a little messed up. I noticed he was heading towards the register so I of course started walking to the register to ring him up. He saw me walking towards the register and when I was seriously no more than a few feet from the register he said ""Come on let's go. Is this how you are trained to treat you're customers? Just keep them waiting all day?"" Now this struck a cord with me because of how close I was to the register and because of how fucking rude of a thing it was to say. But since ""the customer is always right"" I just said I was really sorry and didn't meant to waste any of his time and began quickly ringing up his items. But once I got to his liquor and scanned it he said ""So you aren't going to ask for my I.D.? Are all the employees here this lazy or are you the only one? Get you manager out here."" 

Now I was mad and offended. I had no idea who this fucking guy thought he was and why he was acting like he is somehow better than me. In all honesty after he said that I was livid inside and remembered back to my manager telling me that if we think it is necessary we can refuse business to a customer if they are harassing us or being threatening....etc so this is where I fucked up by saying ""You know what man? We don't want your business. You can fuck off and get the fuck out of here right now."" 

I realized a lot of things right after I said this. I realized that I was yelling, that I over reacted, that I was probably going to get fired, that my manager was watching me from the back of the store, and that the customers shirt under his suit jacket had the company name stitched into it. The customer then identified himself as the CEO who was in town attending a conference (I live in a big city) and that I was terminated. My manager agreed, of course she had to agree no matter what, and so I had to grab my stuff from the back and leave. 

My manager later got in touch with me and apologized for having to agree or she would lose her job and also apologized for the CEO being such a huge dick. Thought I would share just how badly I fucked up. Now I've got to get back to looking for another job haha."
2n9rsp,non_TBI,"This happened Saturday morning. I was trying to block it out of my mind but, to no avail, here I am. 

Some background: I'm 23, a female, and I recently got into strength training. I don't want to be grossly bulky, but I want to be fit. 

Saturday morning, my brother texted me. He had come over to eat breakfast (I still live with my parents, and he visits on the weekend). So I dragged myself out of bed. We decide we want waffles. My mom makes them. Nothing unusual has happened at all. 

As my mom is cleaning up, we are all in the kitchen just chatting. I walk up to my brother. I'm impressed with how my triceps are coming along, so I say ""Hey, dude. Feel my muscle."" Being the older brother he is, he gives me a good punch. He then tells me to feel his, so I punch him back. Then he tells me to punch his abs. Then comes the most terrible moment ever. 

My brother says to my mom, ""Hey, mom, do you have muscles?"" 

Some background on my mom: She's 57 years old; stands a mere 4'10"" tall. She's been working out with me. She is one of those moms that acts like shes 25, but that's ok because she pulls it off. She's full of energy and spunk. 

So after my brother seals our fate with his damn question, we both look at my mom. I'm expecting a tacky, ""Yeah, yeah, check out the gun show."" *pose*pose*pose* Oh how I wish it had played out like that. Dear Lord. Nothing and I mean NOTHING could have prepared us for what happened next. 

My dear, sweet, 57 year old mother turns around. She begins to say, ""Heck yes, I have a sick pack"" all the while pulling up her shirt to show off said six pack. Reddit, this is where it went downhill so fast. As my mom pulls up her shirt to show off her abs, she forgets that gravity is a bitch and she isn't wearing proper undergarments-- well, any undergarments to be correct. 

So there we stand, my brother and I, getting flashed by my 57 year old mother. Being a female, IDGAF. I instantly bust out laughing. I turn around to face my brother. Bless his dear soul. His eyes are filled with such regret for asking the question that got us in this position. As I am crying from laughing so hard, my mom is apologizing  up and down while laughing her ass off as well. My poor brother had no choice but to join in-- what was seen couldn't be unseen. 

After we laughed for a solid 5 minutes because it was so damn awkward, my brother peaced the fuck out. I simply texted him saying ""TIFU by asking my brother to feel my tricep"" and it was spoken of no more. *Shudders*

Edit: Thank you for gold, extremely generous Redditor! You made my day!! :-) (Also thanks for all the upvotes everyone. Getting on the front page is crossed off the bucket list. Getting gilded with gold is too! You all ruleee!)"
2inkvu,non_TBI,"This was about [ten years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2iodmt/user_takes_the_title_of_today_i_fucked_up/), first proper job out of college working for a 60 person company that fixed and resold servers. I had just got my own workstation alongside the guy who trained me in. He was a nice and super strait laced old dude, the wildest thing he did was eat a chocolate bar around 3pm every day. 

Knocking off time for him was 4:30 and I'd finish around 5. One day around 4:15 I look over and he's nodding off at his desk. Personally I have no issue with a quick nap at work so I keep an eye out for the boss and let him at it. By 4:30 he's fast asleep, but it's his home time so I go to wake him up and he's mad groggy, looking at me almost like he's drunk saying ""what's the problem?"". I decide to let him sleep it off for another little while. 

About twenty minutes later, when I'm not looking, the boss comes over and tries to wake him up. Then he goes and gets the first aid guy. They half walk half carry him to the canteen and get him to eat his chocolate bar (apparently he was busy and missed his 3pm sugar fix for his hypoglycemia) while they call his wife to come pick him up.

So yeah, that was the day I covered for someone as they started to fall into a diabetic coma at their desk.

EDIT: Added a link for anyone complaining about the fuck up being ten years ago (read rule 1)."
3czfi6,non_TBI,"I am an old hand at masturbation. Like a grizzled and salty sea dog that has seen too many years on the bow of a battered tug boat, I think I’ve seen it all through a haze of white pipe smoke. **nods sagely**. Only a few haggard superstitions from lands still inhabited by dragons remain. I’m no longer the masturbateur of my teens or even my twenties. I have learnt and grown along this epic voyage into the masturbator I am today. And just like any long voyage, games pass the time. Except instead of “I Spy” I have become exceedingly good at the game of Things Not To Put Your Penis Into.

Actually there are surprisingly few rules for this game. They say to someone with a hammer, everything is a nail, and I’ve nailed most things, even the things that are nailed down. A Walkman? Sure, put some Blu tac around the gears and wear a condom and let it glide under the head. Various fruits, bottles, back massagers? Pfft Child’s play. These weren’t the new-fangled internet days of a million voices coming together as one to solve the problem of spicing up masturbation, they were the cold dark, medieval learn by trial and error of the Before Times. Like alchemists we tested our creations on ourselves, alone and hobbled by our experiments, like Spartan children we were forced to rail against the wild and become victorious.

What I’m trying to say is, I have this shit on lock down. I’m at the stage of life when I should be collecting my notes in a studious leather bound tome to pass onto my children and my children’s children (please no) to guide them forward should the combined maturbatory intelligence of the internet be lacking, what with your electric toothbrushes, vibrating phones and Nicky Minaj ass cheeks these days dumbing all our masturbatory intelligence down. What will you bunch of pillow fuckers do if you’re stranded on a desert island I’ll cry, shaking my fists at the sky - WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN? No Bear Grylls seaweed fuck sleeves for you Gen Y wankers… No MacGyver rubber band and a piece of string lady parts for you.

ANYWAY. As they say, pride cometh before the fall.
As most of these stories start, I was alone. I was painting our new house before we moved in and sold our old one. I was on a deadline. I’d spend hours after work doing the monotonous job of piling more and more paint on top of other slightly less strongly coloured paint. I was stressed and so hadn’t really gotten around to relieving things for a while. Days probably. Anyways I quickly realised the unparalleled freedom I was painting away with. After having new babies not only is sex a fairly distant memory for a lot of people, but even jerking off is only snuck in in fits and starts. Everyone’s asleep? Jerk off. If I’ve actually had enough sleep and am horny in the morning shower? Jerk off. But not the luxurious No Headphones jizzing.. (or conversely, Headphones With No Fear Of Dampening Approaching Sounds Jizzing) Not the edging for hours just because you’re bored and you can.. Not the Jesus Masturbating Christ I Hope I Don’t Have A Heart Attack While Wearing My Wife’s Clothes With A Hairbrush Handle Up My Ass While Looking At A Photoshopped Picture of Her Sister’s Head On Sasha Grey’s Body On The Laptop kind of jerking off. Y’know.. The good stuff.

Suddenly all of the work objects in my house go through the Things Not To Put My Penis In game. The drill? Can I put a paint roller over a thick bit and get it spinning endlessly against the head of my cock? Hrm.. Keep that one for later.. I don’t have a condom or anything to put over it and make it smooth.. The Gatorade bottle?? Bah.. I’d have to fill it with plastic wrappers and oil to get sensation inside… Everything around me is the kind of thing that takes off thumbs in shop class… and I have no lube and no plastic wrap.. Why Lord, why have you forsaken me so? WIILLSOOON! Ok fine, let’s try this. I have rubber washing up gloves and I have soap. I’ve used gloves before.. those clear plastic doctor’s ones.. Soap has been BFF’s with my cock since before I remember.. It’s so simple this just might work! I don’t really have anywhere to jam it into though.. It’s a completely empty house. Normally the easiest thing to make is to unroll and wipe the lube off the outside of a condom and put a lot of lube inside it, then place it in a towel with the base edge poking out and roll up the towel around the length of it and stretch the base ring of rubber around the outside end of the rolled up towel forming a tight sleeve. You then wedge this sleeve in between mattresses, couch cushions, whatever and pretend it’s the doggystyle Olympics and that girl you never fucked in highschool is your reluctant fellow country representative. It’s my lightbulb, my Edison’s sleeve of trial and error to get things just right, my life’s great work. You probably found it on the internet when you were 13 and paid no mind to the fallen heroes that brought it to you.

Here though I only have washing up gloves and soap. I don’t really know why I thought this would be so innocuous. Maybe it’s because it’s been well over a decade since I’ve made any kind of real mistake - I’ve been shooting nothing but net for so long I feel invincible. I’m over-confident and I don’t have plot armour.

I put a little water inside the glove and stick a bar of soap in and really give it a rub about inside the glove to froth things up and I’m ready to go. I get things going the normal way. Savouring my glove vagina like some reserve whore unit in a horrible war against the forces of Onan. Once I am nice and erect I slip it in. Yes, YES my precious! I AM DIFFERENTING! My penis has a new happy place! Strike this down as another win in the win column of life. 
Now do not think I am unaware of soap’s drying effect. I’m not 13 and struggling to remain lubed outside of the bathroom like it’s the first time I’ve tried it. I don’t expect it to be a magical panacea that cures all lack of lubrication, it’s just as long as there is plenty of water in the glove there should remain some slipperiness and frankly I must again state, the house is empty. There are no oils, butters, margarines, hair conditioners. There isn’t even anything I can boil to extract fats from. There is only soap.

**Plateau**

Only.. My wife calls. Shit. Fine. Stop. Phone talk. Yeah yeah, working REAL HARD here honey.. better get back to it, jolly good, tally ho, tea and crumpets. Ok Now I kinda have to get started again.. Only.. there is a sensation starting out this time that I was a little blind to before… it’s not dry.. There is plenty of water in there and it’s still soapy.. But there is a little pain.. I’ve obviously gone on too long and this set back has prolonged this whole endeavour even further.. I’d better get back to it quick smart and finish this thing off.

Now I’m not sure if you’re aware, but being near orgasm is one of the strongest natural pain relievers there is. It’s why using a headache as an excuse to get out of sex is a cuntwhore cutpurse raggard vagabond’s way out. So I’m definitely sensing there is wrongness in the universe, but it’s also pleasant. I guess this is why people mix pleasure and pain, and whips and electrodes are sometimes used in the bedroom.. it’s like a bad itch that I’m scratching.. and like every time your penis goes into a vagina it’s not supposed to, I’m just not thinking straight. I’m completely focussed on the end goal. I’m riding my unicorn down a fluffy rainbow. ITS HAPPENING.

It can’t come soon enough as at least one part of my reptilian brain knows that this whole enterprise needs to stop forthwith. It’s not as if it would be the first time I’ve given myself a friction blister on the side of my wang or something. Salty sea dog, master masturbator and all that.

**Resolution**

Like all sexual mistakes they appear resonant and with almost immediate regret. The Constant of Regret is 28mph, the speed at which ejaculate travels, and much like the speed of light invites immediate speculation about the possibility of time travel backwards to undo mistakes of the Immediately Recent Past.

So as the endorphins leak out of various membranes it’s escalatingly apparent I’ve done damage. I’ve managed to mask the true enormity of the situation. It hurts. Fuck. No really, this is bad. I'm every fallen soldier in a movie with that look in his eyes after he's been disembowelled or had all the skin of his lower body melted off. That pleading look into his buddy's eyes that everything is going to be ok because he can't see the wound. I'm my baby girl who thinks she's invisible when she puts her hands over her eyes and I ask where she's gone. It's Schroedinger's Cock, IT COULD STILL BE OK RIGHT, RIGHT?. I waddle into the bathroom where the light is on and risk a sideways glance down to let the waveform collapse.

BLOOD. WHY IS THERE BLOOD.

ON. THE. HEAD.

MY FAVORITEST BIT.

It’s bright red and fresh. It looks like every gravel rash I had as a kid when I came off my bike ONLY ON THE HEAD OF MY PENIS - It’s some horrible viking death ritual for when the Blood Eagle is considered Soft On Crime. What horrible treachery is this? How could my body work against me like this? Isn’t there an emergency parachute? Some kind of DO NOT WANT alarm? No Darwinian impulse to save the baby making parts? Then I realise if you’re about to come it doesn’t matter whether your cock is mangled and bloody - you finish jizzing now and pass your genes on, then you can bleed out from your cock like a golf course sprinkler system because YOUR JOB IS DONE. The praying mantis she-bitch can bite your head off, you can die stingerless on the ground. There is no great poetry left in you. You have fulfilled your one true purpose and it wasn’t writing that book you always thought you had in you.

Things To Do With A Bleeding Glans

* FuckFuckFuckFuckFuckFuck
* Think of all the good times we’ve had and salute a fallen soldier
* FuckFuckFuckFuckFuckFuck
* Wash some blood off and survey damage?

I pinch the base of the head to restrict or distract nerve signals. I rinse it in the sink and howl. Oh the humanity! OH MISTAKES I HAVE MADE. WHY DOES IT HATES US? Washing up gloves aren't like surgical gloves AT ALL. They have fine texture on the inside like polishing sandpaper and the soap made the rubber gloves the OPPOSITE of slippery. The rubber texture became very very grabby with the soap stripping any natural oils off my cock leaving it super frictionated and proceeded to slough many, many layers of super-delicate skin off while I whacked off like a loon, like some penis shaving savant creating his bloody masterpiece.

I have nothing. No first aid kit, nothing. It’s an empty house. I do however have a foreskin. Oh thank you baby jesus.. soft soothing foreskin… How glad I am right now to have a turtle neck. Sweet holy Steve Job's taint how I love you right now. But like pulling a jumper over a bullet wound, THE FORESKINS THEY DO NOTHING! It hurts like fuck just trying to pull it back over.. And yes even though it’s undoubtedly better than rubbing against fabric, there are sharp, sharp spiking bolts of pain from the raw exposed nerves whenever there is a bump that magically travels through the foreskin which each movement seems to cause. It’s like putting a pillow over someone’s head to dampen a .38 - It’s mostly so you don’t have to witness what you’ve done.

The only thing I have at hand is painkillers. Good stuff too. 12.8mg of codeine and 200mg of ibuprofen. They’re like Tylenol 3’s. I used to get migraines as a kid so I don’t fuck around when it comes to pain. I don’t tough it out and man up.. I just take pills, the stronger the better and get on with life. Anyways. I have a vague plan. Take several pills and maybe by the time I take a shower they’ll have kicked in and I can survey the damage again.

At this point my painting is at an end. I’m calling it a night. Fuck this. I’m not schlepping my bloody stump around the skirting boards of the house. I’m going home and hoping by the time I have a shower I’d move into the next phase of putting a lot of life and distance over this mishap. The knowledge that in a few weeks things that seem bad now will be better has gotten me through a lot in life. There is a road to recovery, a path I can take that will lead me through this. I don't have to run back and forth squealing incredulously. It mostly involves not playing any kind of penis games for a while, but we coo’ right?

**The Worsening**

So I’m on my way home ruing my existence. My penis is crying red tears of blood. I’m having my moon time. My penses. And like a bolt out of the dark it hits me. My baby is teething. Teeth ripping through gums hurts. When it hurts we put on Bonjela baby teething gel. It’s like an anise flavoured local anaesthetic. In the 1890’s they probably just rubbed cocaine on their gums but frankly that’s just too expensive for us and likely to keep her up and crying for longer so Bonjela it is. I fixate on this miracle cure to my ills. I HAVE A LOCAL ANASTHETIC MEANT FOR MUCUS MEMBRANES. HAH! Having a baby was totally worth it just for this moment. All the actions of my life have lead to this final fortuitous crescendo. I high five the universe and drive on! Fuck I’m rad. All I have to do is ensure I have access to this stuff without the wife being suspicious. I formulate a plan. I map out our house. I’ve played enough Hitman, I know how to get in and out without being seen. I’ll grab some Sudocream too, we put that on the baby’s ass to prevent nappy rash. I have penile glove rash.. Perfect. I’m starting to pile up the wins like so many unhatched eggs.

I get home and sneak the items I need into the bathroom. I’m still getting shocks of pain from the nerves and although the painkillers have kicked in, to say I’m approaching peeling back my foreskin under running water with some trepidation is a massive understatement.
I pinch below the base of the head again to help with the nerves, providing another sensation or however it works. I pull back. Yep, still bad. I'm not sleeping this one off, fuck, I'm lucky if I’m going to be sleeping at all. I just have to make it through the next few days… I just have to make it so I can sleep tonight.. With the water running I squeeze a liberal blob of Bonjela out. Sweet mercy here you come.

HOLY SKULLFUCKING BATMAN THE BLOOD IS ON FIRE. MY PENIS IS BURNING WITH THE INTENSITY OF A THOUSAND SUNS FILLED WITH METH CRAZED FIRE ANTS. WHO COULD HAVE FORESEEN THIS? Why is an anaesthetic NOT ANAESTHETIZING? AM I IN OPPOSITE LAND? Soap isn’t slippery anymore.. anaesthesia rounds all your nerve endings up and takes a molotov filled cheese grater to the ends? What. The. Fuck.
ABORT MISSION.

I no longer fear the running water.. The pain level of MERELY GRAVEL RASHED BLEEDING PENIS HEAD is a welcome relief as the Bonjela washes off. AAAAhhhhhhhhh.. Sweet, sweet relief of merely flayed glans under running water, where have you been for the last 60 seconds. 
Why the FUCK didn't THAT work? Why did it do the OPPOSITE of numbing like it was fucking Ramsay Bolton's Flayed Man tincture of Olde Time Cock Healing.

Not at all put off by topical creams I grab a fingerload of Sudocream and cake it on.. FINALLY something that isn’t making my situation actively worse. It seems to at least be neutral in this war. It may launder my gold fillings but darnit, it’s not Michael J Fox holding a burning cheese grater against my cock. I think that holds up as a good guy in any court of law.

I am medicated and covered in a thick coating of Sudocream. The bleeding seems to have stopped or has dialed down to just leaking plasma. I should be able to sleep tonight and begin my long road to recovery. I finish my shower and calculate the odds my wife will want sexy times any time soon. I smile in contentment for the first time in an hour, for I am in opposite land, the fact we have a new baby and I’m not going to get laid before my cock heals is a silver lining this scary, shitty godforsaken place and I’ll take it and hold it close like a r/deadbedrooms safety blanket.

**TL:DR I used a soap filled rubber washing up glove as a fuck sleeve and flayed the glans of my penis like I was fucking a rusty cheese grater until it bled FROM THE HEAD. I proceeded to then make it worse by applying anaesthetic gel for teething babies on it and it turned the blood into rivers of burning fire. I am forever changed and the gods have wrought vengeance on me for my arrogance and pride**

This is a weekend repost after it was baleeted for tarnishing people's weekdays with black dread when only work should have performed that function.

**Update** Holy Fuck front page and Gold! My thank you's are not obligatory, they are for realsies. I am at once saddened that the most popular thing I'll ever do is about a dumb thing I did to my cock on a throwaway account but also happy I managed to spin something good out of the situation and make a few people with hardy attention spans giggle and spread a bit of goodness in the universe (by touching each and every one of you with my bloody cock). You are a funny bunch of fuckers. I hypoventilated laughing at the replies. Somehow they're even funnier than normal when they're directed at you and your misfortune. So the salty tug boat captain thanks his two dubloon benefactors and everyone else for putting some spring in my onetime haggard gait.

Because people are asking, predictably the blunt force trauma of having a baby carve a ruinous hellscape through her vagina made my wife allergic to peen for some time. Because of that she discovered nothing and has no inkling of my plight. It took about two weeks and much Sudocream to heal. I did however tell my brother the very next morning to his great roflfucking schadenfraude as it is a war story that needed sharing.

No, I am not a writer, thanks to anyone who asked though, as that's a very kind inference. I don't have a blog, I don't have a twitter. I barely rise to making myself post sarcastic comments on my friends fb updates. I haven't written a story since highschool English. I doubt I'll do much writing in the future as I've kind of spent my load here and that was only done because I was procrastinating. I'm pretty sure nothing else I do will ever live up to a story about flaying my cock so I'm not exactly encouraged to try and then fail to clear that hurdle for the rest of my life only to be slapped in the face each and every time with a bloody member. Additionally, I'm going to be doing my very best not to create the material for another story like this again.. Thank you to the couple of kind souls who compared it to Chuck Palahniuk, that gave me an involuntary brain boner. I have Lullaby and Survivor but I'll have to check out Guts.
Yeah it could have been edited and snappier, but It's a story about something that happened to my dick, not a Meditation On The Human Condition shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. It was treated with all the time and care a silly true story on the internet about wanking deserved, which is to say, not much. So no I didn't run it past an editor, but I did make sure I enjoyed writing it instead of doing real work, which means yeah it was a bit stream of consciousness, and done to ensure I had no time left at the end to get around to doing the thing I was supposed to be doing. That run on sentence was done just for you guys.

Also I'm assuming about 7 people not old enough to have a credit card and safely get a fleshlight delivered without their parents finding the package have used my condom in a wrapped towel trick. I salute you comrades, plow forth with a mighty vigour.

"
2pu745,non_TBI,"To be honest, tonight would have been incredibly uneventful if it weren't for things unfolding the way they did. I wish it turned out a little better, but I digress.

I'm a construction worker as well as a college student, I do a lot of heavy lifting, and I don't really have much time for dating. I do not live on campus. I live in a small apartment, and the college is only a 15 minute drive away. Last week I was in a relatively minor accident and with my luck, I hurt my back. Bad. I was on a ladder, holding up some very light scaffolding. Next thing I knew, the ladder was falling, and so was I. Out of reflex, I turned to catch myself, but in turning so fast, I actually strained one of the major ligaments in my back and tore some muscle. Went to the ER, had some x-rays done, etc. All they said was I had a minor tear in the muscle and some strain in my ligament (I learned the hard way that we as human beings are not cats, and thus our backs do not work in such a fashion of turning in mid-air and catching themselves) and that I should not do anything vigorous for two-four weeks.

Fast forward to tonight. My professor is young, about 6 years older than me. She graduated high school and college at a very young age, smart and absolutely adorable and sexy to boot. Well, we are both fairly stupid since we both let sexual tension grow between us. I often wondered if other students noticed any sexual tension, but we did not flirt with each other on campus or anything like that. Though I did stay over after class to chitchat, or if she needed help with something. I even stopped by during the next semester when we didn't even have class together anymore.

We live fairly close to each other, and sometimes we run into each other at the stores and at Starbucks and such. We both knew that dating between us is very risky, even though she is technically not my professor anymore, so dating didn't come up. Until today, that is. I finally asked her for coffee, or a day at the public library, something that was fairly benign or mundane. She suggested going to one another's house and watching a movie would be fine with her.

I said that my place was fine, I have a big TV, Netflix, and a huge collection of DVDs. We make it a date and she shows up to my apartment at 8:00 at night. We watch the Dark Knight and eat pizza, and after the movie ends we talk about where we stand... Or should be standing. We tried to talk each other out of doing anything too physical, and to wait the 6 months until I'm graduated. We started weighing the pros and cons of going further than just the occasional hang-out.

But we ended up fucking despite how we knew we shouldn't.
And it was fucking fantastic. While it lasted, anyway. I'm going at her hard and heavy, she's scratching up my back and that just fuels my fire to go even harder. I'm all caught up in the heat of everything, just slamming into her without a care in the world.
And then it happens.

In mid coitus, we both hear this loud POP from my back. It sounded like a steroidal nail gun punched the wall. I was in so much pain that my ears started to ring. I immediately stopped, and she just laid there, eyes and mouth wide open as I nearly buckle on top of her. I'm just growling in absolute pain, wanting to scream and cry like a baby as the burning ache in my back that had been with me all week turned into a stabbing pain that was even worse than kidney stones. And because I lost my shit, she loses her shit, too. I'm stuck on top of her, and she's hyperventilating ""ARE YOU OKAY? OH MY GOD ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? [name] TALK TO ME DON'T FREAK ME OUT."" I manage to collect myself enough to say through clinched teeth ""I hurt my back at work. It's just my back. It's okay. It's okay."" I bet the both of us were thinking ""oh man, people are going to find out. We're absolutely fucked. I can just hear the talking heads on the news. Local construction worker sex scandal with his professor! Oh boy!""

""No, it's NOT okay!"" She lectured me on how I should have just told her before we started, and that we could have done a lot of different, but still fun things. But I didn't think of it, I didn't even -feel- the pain. The power of boner is strong, and overcomes everything. I just stay on top of her, careful not to press my weight on her, even though I wanted to lay flat. But at the same time, I didn't even want to move, just trying to move my lower half hurt. Minutes passed and she said ""You have to go to the hospital."" and I argued with her, I didn't want to go back to the hospital because it was just going to be the same thing I went through last time. Get an x-ray, be told that it's nothing major and get sent home with muscle relaxers and pain pills. Eventually, she won the argument and reached for my landline on the nightstand, she called 911 and told them that we're going to need an ambulance.

As the ambulance made their way I was trying to get off of her, I was trying to move so we could at least put some clothes on, but my back was so tense and in so much pain that I could not move. Soon the EMTs were knocking on the door, ""Just come in! We're both stuck!"" I finally had a burst of dedication and I tried to roll off of her, groaning out pathetically as I moved to no avail. The EMTs let themselves into the apartment, and into my room.

""... Dude."" I heard one of them say, I turned my head to look at them, and realized that one of the EMTs was my friend who had graduated before I did. He was holding back his laughter ""Dude, way to fuckin' go."" I had no idea if he was genuinely impressed or if he was sarcastic, but I didn't care.

They all helped me off of her, and put me on the stretcher. They covered me up and took me to the hospital as naked as the day I was born. My friend gathered clothes for me, and told me that ""my little secret"" was safe with him, and he wasn't about to go tell everyone that I fucked my teacher.

To sum up the hospital visit: I managed to slip a disk in my lower back, since shit was so fucked up that I didn't have much support to begin with, I just made it worse by having sex.
I have a feeling things are going to be incredibly awkward. Or something. I don't know, I'm just nervous to talk to her again because well... This is pretty fucking embarrassing.

TL;DR: Hurt my back at work. Was told not to do vigorous activity. Ended up having sex with my professor. Slipped a disk as a result. I have absolutely no idea how our exchanges (professional or otherwise) are going to be like, now.

UPDATE: She went to the hospital with me, and helped me put on my pants once I came off of the morphine high. She also drove me home and helped me in bed. I was going to add something else to the update but I totally forgot because my pain medication is kicking in.

UPDATE 2: HOLY SHIT I was not expecting this to blow up the way it did. I was expecting this to be regarded as bullshit by the reddit masses and it wouldn't get much attention, but damn. There has been some outcry for updates, and as of now, I don't have very much to update. I wrote this when I got home after the hospital, it was very in-and-out because there wasn't much they can do for me other than give me meds to help the spasms, pain, and swelling, and schedule physical therapy for the next six weeks starting next week. I'm going to try and get up and maybe do some light housework and see what it's like (For the past couple days I've been doing homework, and cooking, which was more than enough for me.) Probably going to be doing light housework and very minimal bending all this week (at the very least, anyway). I'm going to stick to whatever the doctor tells me to avoid the surgery. About the professor and I: She's been calling and asking if I needed help with anything, and if I needed any company. We're going to watch some TV series (something that she likes that I've never heard of) and cook something. I'm very excited to have her over.

For those wondering: Yes, I live in a small town, and it's not very far from the college and the ""college town"".
And yes, this is a repost (THAT WAS WHAT THE FIRST UPDATE WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT. LOL. NOW I REMEMBER.) I posted this on Tuesday, I guess I didn't read the rules? Also, I have a landline for when my cellphone is MIA, and if people need to get in hold of me because of an emergency and i just happen to be at home, or they can leave a voice mail when I'm not."
337rqv,non_TBI,"TIFU Reddit, and i dont think i will ever forget this.

quick preface: i am a 20 [M] in college at a state university. i usually dont post so if this post probably sucks but whatever, i needed to get this off my chest.

So this FU actually occurred today...
while at the local headshop (preparing for april 20) there was a really attractive red haired girl with quite possibly one of the most radiantly attractive smiles i have ever seen in my life standing in line waiting to be helped. as she was waiting, her phone went off and her ringer was r2d2. me, wanting to strike up conversation, told her that was an awesome ringtone, to which she replied that she is a huge star wars fan, which is awesome because i am too! we make small talk, definitely mentioning the new trailer that just was released and whatnot. we were hitting it off well, and we turned out to have so many things in common: we are both huge fans of LoTR, super into gaming, specifically old nintendo console gaming and pc gaming, and obviously smoking (we were at a head shop so that is obvious). then, the absolute kicker of the whole situation was that she browses reddit! everything about this girl is 10/10 and when she walked out the door i thought my friend i was with was gonna kill me for not asking for her number. I've fucked up a lot in my life, theres no doubt about that; but i think this might be one of those fuck ups that haunt me forever.


TL;DR: saw pretty girl who is also fellow redditor, hit it off super well, didnt ask for phone number.



edit: didn't expect this to blow up at all...
for those wondering, I'm from southern Louisiana, I'm not gonna go any more specific than that location. I'm pretty sure that if she reads this, she would know who I am. even the guy working in the store was telling me how I fucked up not getting your number...
also, for those taking me so literally on calling her perfect, yes I know I only met her for 5 min, I didn't mean that's she's literally perfect, she just seems like a cool person and I'd like to get to know her better if the opportunity were to arise.
also, thanks for the gold strangers!

edit 2: so to clear some things up,
yes i go to LSU. no, i actually was not at the ra shop surprisingly enough; my buddy and i were at a 24 hour smoke shop just off campus, those of you familiar with LSU should know what im talking about.

edit 3: just logged back on after spending the day celebrating. there really isn't anything to update, no hits yet. celebrated a lot before writing this so... more updates later

edit 4: so, after celebrating for a full 24 hours... people have sent me pictures of random redheads apparently who go to lsu, so far no matches. that being said... i didnt make this post to find her, i made this post because i was at a solid [6] and just felt like putting it somewhere. also, to the people saying we were gonna date/fuck/etc., NO, i just wanted her number to see where things would have gone had i not been a little bitch about it. and if she did/does have a boyfriend, who cares, she could have been a great friend, who knows."
3ipp35,non_TBI,"This happened less than an hour ago....

Let's preface this by saying that tonight my wife and I have been best friends for 10 years, but have only been married for 3 months. We recently moved to New Zealand, where I started a new job. Needless to say, we haven't been getting a lot of 'quality time'.

So my wife and I are in the bath together, enjoying some naked time, and all of a sudden my stomach starts churning a little.  I just tried to not think about it, even though the grumbling was becoming more insistent.

All of a sudden, I feel it.

A fart moving so quickly towards my ass that I couldn't hold it in and it fired out of me, the noise burbling from the depths of my bowels until it met the surface of the water.  Needless to say it turned our bath into a temporarily steamy Jacuzzi.  

My wife stares at me for a silent second, and says ""Great, now I'm just sitting in your beef stew"" before getting out of the bath. 

I don't think she was all that impressed when I, clearly thinking straight, replied with ""Awwww, we still have firsts!"".

TL;DR: Ruined romantic bath with bubbles *eau de moi*"
2zvkt4,non_TBI,"This FU happened last night but I'm still reeling from it right now. 

I work at a youth detention center which, if you aren't familiar with, can be very exhausting work.  Being a recent college graduate,  I still live at home with my mom and two younger brothers.  My younger brothers are very grab happy and tend to help themselves to whatever they want in my room.

So I get home around 1130 last night, exhausted and famished. I settle for a quick dinner of microwaved taquitos and head straight to bed as I have to be back into work by 6am the next day.  Upon my arrival to my room, I realize that my pillow is noticeably absent from my bed. After a quick search around my room I realize that one of my brothers must have taken it. Being as exhausted as i was, I was in no mood to travel through the house, in search of my pillow. I decided to improvise a substitute (I have a pillow top mattress,  so I basically just spoon with the pillow anyway. ) while conducting my search,  I stumble upon a long forgotten cotton comfort underneath my bed, still tucked away inside a pillow case and everything. ""Perfect"" I think to myself as I tuck it between my legs and drift off into the kind of sleep that only a 15 hour shift can provide. I have the most wonderful dream about myself filling with energy, floating peacefully through the ambient abyss. Somber vibrations melt over my body as I drift through a sea of tranquility.  

Wait...

These vibrations are actually pretty intense.

Cue spiders. EVERYWHERE. On my legs. Crawling up my back. In my hair. On my nose. ON MY COCK 'N BALLS. MY COCK 'N BALLS GUYS! Did I mention I'm arachnophobic? 

Hundreds?  You betcha.  Thousands? Quite possibly.  Millions?  No reddit, not millions.  I mean honestly... the sheer logistics alone of fitting a million spiders into one room... just stop it. 

Anyway,  turns out the abandoned pillow I spooned with had become a nesting ground for one huge slut of a spider and I burst all of the egg sacs with one fell squeeze of my sleepy thighs. After what felt like several minutes of my best Robert Plant impression via ""the immigrant song"" intro,  I bolted to the shower and scrubbed myself raw. I haven't been back into my room since.  I called an exterminator which is scheduled for Monday but there'sa good chance I'll set fire to my room before he gets here. 

tl;dr spiders

Edit: syntax

Edit 2: a thousand thank yous to the user who popped my gold cherry.  Not a million though, a million thank yous is just logistically impossible.  Much too many for any one person to give to any other person. "
29bdzh,non_TBI,"I was on my way to my boyfriends house and he had mentioned that I should bring along some of our toys, so I chucked my vibrator into a bag along with clothes and stuff, ready to spend the night there. My dad had offered to give me a lift on his way to work as my car is in the garage, I happily agreed and we set off on the half hour car drive to my boyfriend's house. Now, I should probably mention that my dad is the kind of dad who refuses to accept that I didn't just stop getting older at the age of 7, it took him about a week to get over the fact that I had a boyfriend, and even now he refuses to accept that we would dare go past hand holding... So anyway, about five minutes into the car journey I heard a weird kind of buzzing noise, it took me a few seconds to realise what it was, and I had that ""OHHH SHIITT"" realisation when my bag started vibrating. It didn't help that the vibrator was pressed up against a can of deodorant amplifying the sound painfully. My dad looked over at me, he said ""What's that sound, is it the car? That sort of vibra....."" his face then dropped as he saw the kill me now look in my eyes and realised it was coming from my bag....he immediately turned back to the road and we sat in almost silence (I couldn't exactly pull out my vibrator and turn it off at this point) for what was the longest, most painfully awkward half hour of my life. Consider our innocent father daughter relationship, official over.

edit: To answer some questions, I am 19 and awkward as shit... my current boyfriend is the first guy I have ahem, ""done stuff"" with.. he brought me the vibrator along with some other things for my birthday, and I am not any kind of all knowing vibe genie, but I know that the constant vibration of a rabbit sounds very different to a phone, but that's irrelevant, I am not a smart girl. :("
3o5pnb,non_TBI,"This wasn’t today. I’m male in my 30s now, this happened when I was around 16. I’ve been told by several friends I need to post this partly for entertainment and partly because I might find her. I apologize is advance. I know it’s long but I wanted to have some fun writing this so I wrote it to her in hopes that she finds this. I’m over this now but this was a brutal mindfuck then. 


You were a short, sexy, and nerdy MN Target employee around 2000-2001. You are one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen and I had the biggest crush on you. We were both in high school but at different schools. I was a nerd and not adept with women then. It took me a while to start talking to you. Even then my attempts to talk you were awkward because I was nervous……at first. You seemed to understand and just went along with it. We got to know each other and flirt but before it could go anywhere you had put in your 2 weeks’ notice. I finally worked up the courage to ask for your number which you happily gave. /excitement

With you gone from Target I had to work up the courage to call, only to find that I never added your number to my list. I didn’t have a cell phone then so I kept a list of phone numbers in a notebook. I turned the house upside down twice trying to find the little slip of paper with your number on it with no luck. Since I knew only your first name and the pronunciation of your last name which was spelled weird I couldn’t find you by name. I was disappointed but not through, someone had work probably knew. 
I didn’t have better luck at work. No one knew your number, and those that could have looked up your last name wouldn’t tell me for privacy concerns. They were right to do that but that didn’t help me. I felt like a detective working on his most important case of my life and failing horribly at it. 

Before you left Target, I needed a ride home one day. Since your mom picked you up (we were 16), she drove us to my place while we talked. It felt like a date and even though it was a short trip to my place and in front of your mom. It was October so we talked about Halloween plans. We had arranged a sort of date on Halloween. Where you were going to meet me at my place so we could go trick or treating together. Our quick date/ride home came to a short end at my house. We hugged and agreed to meet on Halloween if not sooner. 

Since you never took down any of my information the only way for you to come to meet me was by memory from going to my house once while we were talking. I wasn’t really expecting you to show but I really REALLY hoped you would. I did wait outside all night for you in case you did show. After you didn’t show, I thought that was it. I thought you were lost to me forever. 

Out of pure luck and randomness or maybe just the universe being a teasing bitch, I ran into you on my way out of Perkins in the waiting area. I think you were on a date with some dude, who wasn’t happy but didn’t do anything to stop us from talking. There was a moment when our eyes met that I was overcome by something and it just felt like we connected instantly. All the nervousness I normally felt when trying to approach women and even you previously (I was a nerd after all) was gone. You must have felt it too as you had this star struck look in your eyes. We shared a moment on your date with another dude. I quickly told you how I lost your number and how I waited for you on Halloween hoping you would show. I asked for your number again but this time asked you to put it in my phone. You eagerly entered your number in my phone and I had you write it down on a piece of newspaper I tore off as a backup. I wanted to kiss you before I left and I think you wanted me to but I already felt like dick because your date was right there watching this unfold. So I left on cloud 9 so happy and convinced I’d have a date with the girl I’d been crushing on for months. 

The next day, I woke up late. So I was extra groggy and rushing to school. My 89’ Beretta (PoS) had this kind of shelf on the dashboard that’s great for holding stuff. It also has a great “feature” where if the passenger window is open and I make a fast left turn everything on that shelf goes right out the window.  I thought I had the window closed enough that it wouldn’t be an issue. It was open just enough for my cell phone to go through. Bear in mind, I’ve dropped this phone many times including on concrete and on metal stairs. Though dented and scratched, it kept on going. Here’s what I think happened to my phone. My phone flew out my window and into the side of an invisible alien space craft where it shattered and fell to ground. Then the ship took off, scared by my cell phone attack. The shitty flip phone was closed when it flew out my window and there was nothing but tall weeds in the ditch that should have broken the fall. How it broke in half and shattered is beyond my understanding. I managed to recover the bottom half of the phone in several pieces but couldn’t find the top. 

I tried not to panic about losing your number in the phone because you wrote it down and I had that slip of paper at home. When I got home after school, I couldn’t find the slip of paper. I never added it to my notebook because I had my phone now. I turned the house, my car, and the alien ditch upside down looking, but found nothing. I was more panicked now but there was a chance they could recover if from the pieces of my phone.

I brought the pieces of my phone to the Verizon store. I told clerk the story thus far. After some laughs, the guy at the store pulled out an unbroken model of my phone to see if we could follow along with the key presses without the screen and a couple other things he could think of. No success and I could see that he really didn’t like giving me that news. He sympathized and gave me a new phone when the warranty I had called for a refurb. That was already awesome of him but he had more. 

I knew the school she went to so I could check a yearbook. Thanks Verizon guy, you are a gentlemen and a scholar! If I could find her in a yearbook, I could get the spelling of her name, which I could look up in the phone book to hopefully find her number. (I still feel creepy about that but you would have done it too.) I tried checking out a friend’s yearbook from her school but there was a possibility that your photo wasn’t there. I also realized I might not recognize you. I’d only ever seen you at work and at Perkins once but I only recall what you looked like at work. At work you always looked a bit stressed, tired, and never dressed up. It didn’t look like you put any effort into your looks but somehow you looked absolutely, inescapably beautiful. If you were taking yearbook photos, you would probably put in the effort to look good and therefore I might not recognize you. Whether that was the case or your photo wasn’t there, I’m not sure but that was my last lead. 

I had nothing else to go on, and that’s where the anti-climactic story ends. That’s what made this so much more frustrating. This whole ordeal felt like it was building up to an awesome climax where the protagonist overcomes adversity, gets the girl, and they live nerdily ever after. It was the making of every romantic comedy movie but with a shitty albeit real ending. This was the first datingish situation I’d ever been in. 

Cheers to you sexy Target nerd, where ever you are. 


**TL;DR** – I finally worked up the nerve to ask out my work crush, she gave me her number and I lost it. Ran into her randomly and got her number again only to have it taken from me by aliens. 

**Edit 1** This blew up. I have more comments than time right now. I'll respond to comments as soon as I can but it might not be till tomorrow. "
3bfddx,non_TBI,"This happened last week. 

I'm starting a new job soon, so I had to do a pre-employment physical, which includes a drug test. In case you didn't know, these drug tests are urine-based. I don't do drugs, and never have, so I wasn't worried about it. 

What I didn't know is that apparently this medical office also tests for glucose in the urine since the test strips are really cheap or something. Well, mine came up positive. The nurse said there was ""only a little bit"" of urine, but that it was definitely above the threshold for a positive test. Urine contains glucose when your blood glucose is elevated, which is most commonly caused by diabetes.

Well lo and behold this poor nurse spent the next half hour trying to figure out what was going on, given that I have no diabetic history and my blood sugar level (a much more reliable indicator of diabetes) was normal. Eventually she decided to just pass me for the pre-employment physical and make me see another doctor to treat my possible pre-diabetes. This entire time, I was completely mortified. I think the nurse thought I was digesting the ramifications of a possible diabetes diagnosis but I was actually quite embarrassed because I knew exactly how the sugar got into my pee.

In case you haven't figured it out yet, I don't have diabetes. The night before I had some ""intimate"" time with a girl. We rather enjoyed whipped cream as a prop... And I fell asleep right afterwards without any kind of clean up. Definitely the last time I do this right before a urine test. I thought I was going to die of embarrassment in that damn clinic. 

TL;DR - getting a whipped cream blow job and then taking a drug test may trick people into thinking you have diabetes. "
2m2h3b,non_TBI,"This morning I get up for work, jump in the car and start the ignition. My engine immediately starts caterwauling. 

Do you remember the messages in your facebook feed about how cats take a nap in your engine block to hide from the cold, or even heat? I found out the hard way they're true. 

A little black cat (less than a year old) jumped out from under my car. She had a loosely dangling rear leg and several skin injuries. Needless to say, the poor thing was scared out of her wits, not to mention in terrible pain. 

Thankfully, an old lady in the street saw me comforting that cat while I was trying to reach several vets (none of whom were in office at that time). She pointed me to where the owners lived. 

So I rang them out of bed, and passed on a couple of the phone numbers I dialed. I'll go check in a few days to see if she's doing fine. 

Accidents like this may be unavoidable, but I still felt guilt and responsibility. 

**tl;dr:** Tap your hood. Cats can get hurt if you don't. 

----------------

**Update:** Kitty cat didn't make it. :( 

I went by that house again last night to see what was up, but there was no good news to be told. Apparently she had gotten a belly wound too. It wasn't immediately visible because it had been immediately scorched shut (and she had black fur too).

Damn shame. "
2etvcw,non_TBI,"I was driving home while on the phone (it's legal here) with Death Sphere Phone Company. I had been on hold with them for 30 minutes, so the thought was to get home and not have to speak with them in the car. I pull up behind another car at a red light and start reading out loud their bumper stickers while the hold music continues.

""I like my husband, but I love my horse."" ""I <3 horses!"" ""If you don't love my horse, then you don't love me."" Etcetera. I then follow with the next logical statement, not on her stickers, but in my mind, and proudly proclaim, ""I fucked my horse!"".

I then register that the hold music stopped at the beginning of that sentence.

From the line, a soft feminine voice, ""Uh...""

""Uh.""

""Um, sir?""

""Uh.""

""Sir,"" *giggling*, ""how can I help you today?""

""Uh.""

I look over at my wife in the passenger seat, and see her with hand over mouth, face screwed up in a rictus of shaking pain from not laughing audibly.

""I'll call you back.""

I hang up and my wife starts laughing at me, as I search my steering wheel for meaning. I still need to call back. Wife is still calling me horse fucker."
3d4osr,non_TBI,"This happened like 5 minutes ago. I (male) work with cousin (female) at a family business. We have a water cooler in the office that had just run out. As I got up to leave the office, she shouted ""remember you need to fill the water butt up!"". I immediately responded with ""I'll fill YOUR butt up"". I'm hiding in the kitchen and I might have to quit work from embarrassment. Oh god.

EDIT: Morning! Just a few things, for the sake of clarity;
1, at the risk of losing all this precious, precious karma, I don't want to do butt stuff with my cousin, it was just me being ""funny"" and firing back a reply that I would normally reserve for a friend.
2, by ""water butt"" I mean ""the water bottle"", it just sometimes gets called that around the office because it is similar to an actual water butt.
3, no pictures of my cousin ya damn dirty apes.
Anyways, she'll be in work in like 2 hours, so we'll see how it goes!

Edit number 2: It hasn't been mentioned all day. Sweeping it under the rug like nothing ever happened. Dealing with it in the correct, british way."
2rmri8,non_TBI,"TIFU by going to a thrift store but this is by no means something that happened today, it was actually about a year ago but i'm loving this subreddit so i thought i would share... anyway...

Normal Saturday afternoon, brought the hubby some lunch at work... driving around town... I'm pretty new in town so im still learning my way around. I remembered passing a Thrift Store sign when i drive to and from hubbys work so i thought i would go check it out.

Note: Many businesses in the area are repurposed homes. It's a bit odd to see so many businesses that look like houses, but i kinda live on the outskirts of town.

I find the place and walk up to the front door and try the handle. Locked. I then notice a post it note taped to the door that says ""thrift shop around back"". Er.. okay. So i walk around the house and all i see is a clearly man made staircase leading to the second floor. Okay... makes sense i guess, they live below, the store is up top.
I walk up the stairs and the door is wide open, just the screen door in place. It's unlocked. I walk in to what looks like a normal kitchen.
My dumbass thought they may have just laid their store out like a house.. I'm checking out the toaster for a good minute before deciding i dont really need a toaster and i walk into the next room.. to see an entire family.. mom, dad, sister, brother, grandma, grandpa.. eating dinner and watching TV. 
I was so shocked all i could muster was a meek ""Is this your house?"" then walked out terribly embarrassed. Almost fell down their man made staircase too...

TL;DR - I accidentally walked into someones house thinking it was a business. So glad i didnt get shot..

EDIT: IT WAS NARRATED! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onNAy2p9KEE

EDIT EDIT: I mean ""man made"" as in they clearly built it themselves

2jn8ql,non_TBI,"Oh, reddit. I goofed up. Throwaway for obvious reasons. This actually happened about an hour ago. Hooray!

So, a little background. My local municipalities are renowned for being real douche canoes. I send the check for my water bill via mail, but apparently this month they didn't get it. I didn't realize until they shut my water off on Friday. I hopped online, paid the bill, and called hoping they would just head over and turn it back on. Nope. I get to wait until Monday. Hooray! 

So naturally, I can't take a shit in my house for the next few days. I long ago used the last remaining flush in the tank. I'm an amateur bodybuilder and I eat a lot of damn food. Today just happened to be my monthly break day, where I gorge myself on anything and everything I deem suitable for the king. Today it was some Chipotle, four brownies, and a BBQ chicken pizza. Now, I had all ready taken a glorious shit at the mall. I thought I was good for a while, and would just head to the gas station when I need to drop another deuce.

Fast forward to around four hours ago. I'm a bit sleepy, and my crush is going to be meeting up with me later in the evening for dinner. I decide to take a couple hour nap. I lay down and all is well. A few times I groggily recognize I'm going to need to poo soon, but I'm in the midst of sleeping and fall back into my slumber. 

Suddenly I'm shocked awake by some pangs in my stomach and bowels that can only mean one thing. The devil shits. There is no time to get to a gas station. Like a prom night mishap, this thing is coming whether I like it or not. 

I start to panic. I'm brainstorming where I can feasibly pinch off a loaf without ruining something. I'm pacing around my kitchen (I fell asleep on the couch; my living room and kitchen are joined) and I see my cat's litterbox. No. No. Yes.. no. Yes. It has to be done. There is no other way. I rip a roll of paper towels off of my counter. Just as I'm beginning to assume the position over the poor litterbox, my phone rings. It's on the counter, and I can see it's my crush. Woman.. I'm in a real bad place right now, and I'm sorry, but I can't answer the phone. 

So, here's where the real fuckup comes into play. All of my friends, relatives, and my crush know where I stash my house key outside so they can just let themselves in and hang out. I have a pretty relaxed relationship with the people I'm close too and they kind of just come and go as they please, which I'm fine with. I love company. 

Turns out my crush has decided to stop by WITH HER MOM TO SEE WHATS UP. 

I tear my shorts off, and just let it fucking rip. If I had been on a toiled seat, I would have achieved lift off. I'm spraying cat litter everywhere with a viscous, cheesy, Chipotle-y mix of swamp stew. I'm in the zone and I don't hear the door unlatch. My crush rounds the corner as I'm letting out the final grunts of victory. 

I see her and just holler 'FUCK!'

I proceed to lose my balance and fall in my shit stew. 

The house reeks. 

Her mother screams, and they both run back downstairs. 

Radio silence since..

Reddit.. I fucked up. 

Tl;dr: Don't make poo in your litterbox, no matter how dire the circumstances, kids. 

Edit: Thanks to Cyae1 for the narration! Awesome! [Narrated] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO-2cSonDpQ&index=53&list=PLl0DkyQa9Aqu_aWjvjzvySIZC8PHUPPO6)

Edit 2: Gilded! Damn. Looks like this is going to graduate from throwaway to main account. Thanks stranger!

UPDATE: All right guys. I read through the comments and here's what's happened thus far. I got ahold of my crush (No, I'm not twelve, it was just the best way I could think to put it. Sigh.) She texted me with a ""Do I even want to know?"" And I just sent her a link to this thread rather than trying to explain it. I figured that would work better, honestly. She ""lol'd"" and said it was fine, although that I'm a fucking weirdo and I should just let her know if I need to take a poop at her house. 10/10, would crush again. She didn't mention her mom's reaction at all.. I know her whole family pretty well though, and she's kind of a bro. So hopefully this conveniently goes away. Or knowing my luck I'll end up marrying this girl and we'll keep a litterbox for all of our children. I don't know. 

For all of you lovely people who question me just making this shit up, that's honestly fine. Pretty normal for any TIFU I guess. Please keep pointing out plot holes and maybe I can convince myself this didn't happen. 

I also am aware you can flush a toilet by pouring water into the bowl quickly, but I only had two gallons of water on hand. It honestly didn't occur to me to put it in the tank.. I  also have an English Mastiff, and he wasn't about to let me use his drinkin' water to poo with. I WAS SLEEPY AND PANICKED AND I HAD TO SHIT, OKAY? IT WASN'T MY PROUDEST MOMENT. 

I'll check back in in a few days and see what is going on and update if needed. Good night, sweet Reddit! 

Edit 3: FRONT PAGE WHAT IS LIFE"
28lj0b,non_TBI,"My girlfriend was over for a few days, and unfortunately I live with my parents while I attend University.

We have a goofy relationship..and more often than not I am doing something awkward or crazy to get a laugh out of her.

She left the room without saying much and I assumed she walked into the bathroom next to my bedroom, as shortly after she left, I hear the door close.

I pulled off my pants and slowly unlocked to door to avoid making a sound...

Got my dick in a full helicopter then burst into the room.

My mom is sitting there screaming at the horror at the tornado of cock headed towards her. (cocknado)

I am so embarrassed.. we haven't made eye contact yet.

Will keep you up to date when the awkward silence ends

Edit: 
Mom: Don't worry about it. Your dad does that all the time...
Me: TO BATTLE!!!!..JK

-She just started laughing while making the salad for dinner and said ""what the fuck Michael""

Edit:Turned out OK. We had a good chuckle at dinner and she knows I was trying to bug my Gf but now she thinks I am a weirdo haha.

"
3sv2ek,non_TBI,"So this fuck up actually did happen today, about five hours ago. 

My girlfriend had just gone downstairs and I was finishing a conversation with her parents upstairs. After finishing the conversation, I headed downstairs, I notice she's in the bathroom. Being the quick-thinking guy I am, I silently run across the room and hide in the corner to wait for her to come out of the bathroom. This way, when the door opened it would be blocking her view from me. For the record, the room is pitch black - I was gonna scare her so well! 

Fast forward 15 seconds of waiting, the door opens and I prepare to strike! Once she walks out I leave my spot from against the wall and go to grab her waist from behind. The next thing I realize is feeling a quick strike of pain to my face, seeing stars, and laying on the floor. 

By this point, she is screaming, I'm cursing, her parents are probably thinking we're having sex in their house. I'm no small guy either at 6'2, 190 lbs (not saying I'm big, but I've started varsity at offensive line for a few years now), and just finished my senior year of football, but she took me down in one hit. 

Apparently I was a murderer for a fraction of a second in the pitch black and paid the ultimate price. I'm proud of her for being able to throw out a good punch if she had to :) 

TL;DR: Girlfriend is Ronda Rousey and I saw stars, will have black eye tomorrow. 

Edit: Turns out she is actually Holly Holm, much more accurate! Thank you all for responding! Glad I could make someone laugh, I can't wait to have to explain this eye to anyone who asks. 

Edit 2: Grammar

Edit 3: Huge thanks to the people who aren't trying to give me relationship advice. While I appreciate all opinions, I assure you I am not manipulative or malicious to my girlfriend. We've dated for a few years now and have laughed about this incident more than I think the average couple would! Keep the comments coming, we're laughing pretty hard at some of them! 

Thank you for the gold!!! You the bomb "
3qiu8z,non_TBI,"You know when you look back at something you have done and just cringe?  Yeah, well this is mine.


Me and a few mates are pretty drunk, standing in line to a club we wanted to check out.  We arrive right on peak entry time so the line was huge, like 'wrap-around-the-corner' huge..


So, naturally, when in a group with your drunk mates you tend to start playing pranks on each other, and my mate Ben did exactly that. 


Ben suggests we play a game where ""we hum the tune to a song and the others have to guess what the song is called""...

Never mind that the game sounded like the most ridiculous, lame and just all-round shitty game in the world, I was pretty drunk and duly accepted my friend's challenge.  

Anyway, Ben starts to hum the tune to the 'Oompa Loompa' song in Willy Wonka - you know, the Oompa Loompa doopedy dooo! I've got another puzzle for you! Oompa Loompa Doopedy Dee! You get the picture..

Drunk me immediately recognises the song and in a blaze of triumphantly drunken glory I jump out of the line into an empty space to capture the attention of all to see.  I knew the fucking song! I had to share it with the world!


Everybody sort of pauses as I jump out of the line and turns.  WTF is this guy doing.. 


I begin to sing in a sweet sweet inebriated melody:
""OOOOMMMPAAHHHH LOOMPAAHHHH DUPEDDYY DOO!!""


Gasps.. Horror.. 
Girls whispering in loud bitching voices ""what a dickhead"" to their friends.
My mates are losing it. Literally crying on the floor laughing.
I of course, have no idea what is going on.. 


That was until I saw the midget standing in line, hands on hips, staring at me like I invented Ebola.


I don't quite remember what happened next.  Whether it be the alcohol or the indescribable feelings of guilt and apology I'll never know..


I did not get in the club. I had multiple macho dudes requesting to fight me on behalf of aforementioned midget.
There was zero chance of me getting laid.
I instantaneously became the ""did you hear about the guy that sang the Oompa Loompa song to a midget"" guy.


I woke up the next morning thinking ""what happened last night?"" and then ""ahh yes, the whole singing the Oompa Loompa song to a midget dilemma.."" Fuck. It actually happened.


To my dear little-person, wherever you are;
I. didn't. Mean. To. Do. It. 
So much shame bro.. 
Please accept my apology.


May the cringe I now will have for the rest of my life make up for the wrongs I did to you..


To Ben, I salute you.  Good job mate.  But I don't forgive. I don't forget.  And I owe it to my little midget friend to get you back when you least expect it.



TL;DR unintentionally called a midget an Oompa Loompa.


Edit: To all of those offended by the word 'midget', it was not my intention to offend. In hindsight I should have used a more appropriate word. I asked my mates what they thought on the matter, and using them as a sample population I do agree it may have come across offensive.  Again, it was not my intention to offend.

To all of those butthurt out there for me being irresponsible and drunk etc., I am trully ashamed of what I did and would not have done it if I knew there was a ""little person"" there.  I am writing in A TIFU after all.. I fully acknowledge that I fucked up. *Throws salt*"
2ubx5i,non_TBI,"WARNING! YouTube link to narration at the bottom that may auto play for some people. Headphone discretion advised! 

So unusually for me, this didn't happen today. It was a couple of weeks ago.

I've been dating my GF now for about a month and a half, and everything is going great (we'll call her Jamie, since that's my generic online name for her). She's my first girlfriend and she's absolutely amazing. She puts up with me being a short, sort of awkward, red-headed theater geek like no one I could even imagine. She's a real heart stopper. That's a big part of why I feel so bad about this.

She was at my house and Dad thought it would be a great idea to go out to dinner. Sweet. He mentioned that he heard about this nice place at work that we should try.

Well we get there and it turns out to be a vegetarian/vegan place. =/ None of us are vegetarian. But the line is short and we're already here, so we decide to stay.

Good choice. I had a great plate of pasta and Jamie had some kind of Asian salad. Everyone had a great time, and it went better than expected. Yay!

We go home and hang out for a while waiting for her dad to come pick her up. He shows up outside and she gives me a hell of a kiss. She's such an awesome kisser. I get all silly every time she does. =) Then she leaves. =(

Anyway, I hop on my computer to hang out on IRC for a while, maybe browse Reddit. After a while, my mouth gets a little itchy. Whatever, just take a couple benadryl and move on. Wait, this doesn't feel right. Is this what I think it is? It is. Where did this come from.

Oh right, Jamie has an Asian salad. With a peanut dressing. 

I'm allergic to peanuts. =|

Shout for mom, check. Epipen, *thwack! Lights sirens, hospital, vomit, pass out.

I'm okay now, but Jamie felt horrible for half a week since she almost killed me. Luckily, we're over it and still dumb teenagers in love. But we need to remember she needs to brush her teeth next time.

TL;DR: Girlfriend kissed me and took my breath away.


EDIT: Wow, this has been amazing! Thanks to everyone for the supportive words and comments. I'm working right now to upvote all of you. Also, someone needs to record that song. XD

EDIT 2: WAHOOOOOO! I've been narrated by /u/Cyae1 ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdUjSdJRXTo

EDIT 3: Major feels to all of those who've shared stories about those less fortunate than I am. That's a horrible thing to have happen, and my thoughts and feeling got out to all of you. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

3d2ke8,non_TBI,"This happened like an hour ago and I don't know if I made the weekend deadline but anyway...

For my 19th birthday my sister decided to get me a bullet vibrator.
So I was having a dabble looking at /r/gonewild today when I decided to get a little frisky. 

Cut to 10 minutes later and I'm watching porn when I get the brilliant idea to use previously mentioned vibrator. Feels pretty good.

Feeling a lil bit kinky now I decide to lube up my little bullet and put it in my ass. Things get hotter and the bullet slips out of my grasp and gets sucked into my butt.

No big deal right? I'll just finish myself off real quick and do the ol' squat and cough and it'll come right out! WRONG!

I'm freaking out by this point so I make a dash to the downstairs bathroom, clearing my throat as I walk past my moms room to cover the slight buzzing.
Squatting over the loo I'm straining to get it out, using one hand to steady myself and the other to try and grab the damn thing.

Cue to getting my hand covered in shit as the fucker finally comes out along with some excess.

BONUS EW! I keep washing my hands and the smell just will not go.
**TL;DR Butt sucks in vibrator. Vibrator comes back out bringing gifts.**"
34askt,non_TBI,"**Posted this in a comment on AskReddit, but I think it belongs here**

This happened many years ago, at a crucial point in childhood when a kid's life begins to be set out in front of him.

So, I'm sure like many of us here, I was awkward as all fuck when puberty hit. Puberty itself was the spark on top of many years of shit; from growing up with a violent sister with borderline personality disorder to physical attacks from complete strangers due to my skin color throughout a chunk of my childhood. Probably one of the biggest things that kept me out of touch from my peers was the fact that they were from rich families and I was not.

My grandparents were wealthy and provided us a great education through private schools in a very high-end, uptight community, but my mom had been hellbent all her life to not rely on them for anything else (except for her vehicles, apartments, houses, Starbucks addiction, and other things, while keeping up the facade of being a ""Make it all on my own"" type of woman), so, I went to school with kids who had parents that were doctors, lawyers, successful-ologists of all kinds, and their lifestyles reflected it. They always had the hottest clothes, the newest tech, and could watch the popular shows on cable and satellite, while I had thriftstore clothes, no tech, and our TV only received Fox. My friends loved the new show Spongebob and would laugh about certain scenes, while I had no clue what the hell they were talking about.

I had one best friend though. He was fun, nice, frequently up to sleep over, watch movies, etc...

It's somewhere around 2002-2003, and my mom had a laptop for her writing that she would let me use at times. The wonders of AOL instant messaging, anime chatrooms, and Gaia Online is where I found like-minded individuals that I could relate to, and I felt like things were okay. I started spending less time outside and more time on a computer, but, even so, I felt good about myself. So, from gaining confidence after a few months of making online friends, I ask my best friend the AOL screen name of my long-time crush.

This girl was ""that one"" that I had been crushing on for years. From 1st grade to the, at the time, present grade of 7th.  So, I gathered my recently-manned-up balls and sent her a message. I don't recall the exact words, but the interaction went something like this **(I've included my screen name at the time for added cringe)**:
  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** Hi.  
**Her:** hi?  
**Her:** whos this?  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** RadicalElation, from school.  
  *(I used to roleplay on forums and chats, so I was all about capitalization and punctuation)*  
**Her:** oh hey whats up?  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** Not much, but there's something I have to tell you that I'm having a hard time trying to tell you...  
**Her:** ok  
*(After a couple minutes of staring at my screen, trying to feel courageous again)*  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** I like you. I've had a crush on you since 1st grade.  
*(Another couple minutes of silence, but this time I'm in shock over what I just actually did)*  
**Her:** i'm sorry. i dont feel the same. we can still be friends tho  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** Oh.  
  
After that, my amazing internet social skills kicked in. Anyone who spent plenty of time on Gaia, Neopets, and various other sites, knows that there were ways of talking, and terms, used that don't translate well to people who don't frequently browse those places. There was one term in particular that, outside of those awkwardly social worlds, was normally a pretty bad one. Scary to some, even. On those sites, though, it was playful, common, and relatively ""normal"".
  
**CuddlesTheKitten:** That's okay. **Then I'll stalk you!  n_n**
  
That's it. That's the sentence that ruined my life.
  
**Her:** omg what?
  
Not 10 seconds later, messages poured in...
  
**Her ""BF""**: what the fuck did u just say to her  
**Her best friend**: omg u creep wtf is rong with u???  
**Her other best friend**: y the fuk would u say taht?
  
A couple other people messaged, saying the same sort of thing. I tried to message everyone back and explain, just that I liked her and I didn't mean anything by it. I started feeling cold and shaky, and had no idea what the hell to do, so I closed the computer, curled up on my bed, just relived it all over and over and until I fell asleep.

I faked sick the next day. I knew everyone at school knew what happened, so I didn't want to face it. There were only 3 grades with each split into two separate classes, about 15 kids each. It was a small school, everyone was friends with everyone, and most of us had been friends, going through the private school chain, since preschool. None of them remained my friends though. 

I went back the day after and no one spoke to me. Just to each other, and then whispers when I was near. I felt more out of place than ever before, and not even my best friend would talk to me. He told me himself, those words, *""I don't want to talk to you.""* Followed by, *""We can't be friends anymore.""*

That was the last day I went to school. I faked sick every day after, which resulted in numerous doctors visits with no one able to figure out what the hell was wrong with me. I became a master of it, managed to get a hold of an identical thermometer that I'd heat up to swap out with the one my mom gave me every morning, and even scalded my mouth by holding hot water in it at the doc's office, swallowed right before my temp was taken, and fooling the quickie digital thermometers they had.

It must've become clear that the problem wasn't physical, because I ended up talking to a therapist every two weeks. The guy was an asshole though, even my folks agree to this day that he wasn't much of any good.

My days were spent asleep, while my nights were spent online. I made more online friends to fill the hole caused by my fuck up, and ended up feeling like they were enough.  It eventually got to the point where my mom stopped trying to get me to go to school, and then, after a year or so, I moved in with my dad. I became even more reclusive, despite efforts from my dad, and the local public school system, to try to get me out, in school and around people. 

This continued until I was 15, until there was a knock on the front door at 4:30 in the morning. Two large men were there to take me away to a therapeutic wilderness program several states away. I spent nearly 2 years away from home in wilderness and boarding schools, which provided many crazy stories of their own, with the last facility losing all records of my credit history, so all the hard work I put in with the ""school-at-your-own-pace"" system they had was lost. I was just credits away from graduating. Came home at 17, just a couple months before becoming 18, no credits, no friends, no nothing.

And that's how one sentence ruined my life.

**Edit**: Since people are asking, I am doing great these days. What I went through made me a better person in the end, so I have no problems with what happened. Even though I have no desire to try to talk to anyone from middle school, I don't hold any negative feelings towards them. 

The reality is that it was just the straw that broke the camel's back. It was really one of the least damaging incidents in my life, but it caused what remained of my beaten-down mental state to collapse. Still, I caused it to happen by being socially inept, which is why it's my fuck up. 

I'm in a very happy place in life with people I love, even if I'm not a success in any financial or social sense. My home is lacking some walls and flooring, and my kitchen counter-top is made of Dollar Tree paper table paper, and I will likely not be able to do anything about these problems any time soon, but I am happy. This was just a cringe-worthy, depressing moment in my history, and it is far in the past.

I hope all who read this are happy as well, and if some of you are not, I hope you get there. I'm open to be talked to if anyone is struggling. I'm no professional, but I have an ear ready to listen.

34qf18,non_TBI,"Obligatory ""didn't happen today"", this was a few weeks ago.  
I was playing with my dog when he rolled over so I could scratch his belly.  As a good dog-mother I dutifully obliged,  until I saw  something that concerned me.. what appeared to be a possible  infection in his doggy nether-regions. I immediately got up and went to my husband in the other room and  told him  ""The dog has what kind of looks like  pus coming from his pens! Is it infected?  Should we take him to the vet?!"" Cue my husband looking at me like I'm an idiot until I finally realized what the goo coming from my dog's dick was and promptly did the heebie-jeebie dance.  Things between the dog and I haven't been the same since.

3ebfbn,non_TBI,"Hi Reddit. Okay, so my fuck up was around an hour ago.

So, I was attending a dinner with a lot of my parents' friends. Although I recognized a lot of them, there were also a few people I did not recognize. I was sat next to an obviously pregnant woman. However, despite being pregnant I realised that she was also drinking quite a bit. And, me being the nosy person I am, was getting quite annoyed by how reckless she was being. So, as she was finishing her second glass and refilling it, I turned to her and said, ""Don't you think you're being a little unacceptable?"" to which she replied with a confused, ""Pardon?""

And, then I started going on this rant-like lecture that went something like, ""Listen, I'm sorry if this comes off as rude or all of a sudden but don't you think you should be a bit more responsible? I mean, there's a *baby* growing inside of you, shouldn't you care more about its well-being and not be drinking?""

So, this woman, who looked to be in her late 20s or so, stared at me for a few seconds, then puts down her glass. I thought she was going to apologise or something, and admit that I was right when she goes, ""I'm not pregnant.""

Okay, so by now practically all the blood ran to my cheeks. I realised that I made the mistake that even many great ones made and indirectly called a woman fat by assuming she was pregnant. And, honestly, I wish it ended here but *noooo*, apparently God hates me or something because in my utter embarrassment, I convinced myself that she was definitely playing some type of practical joke on me like I heard many pregnant women like to do. Because, seriously, there was **no way** this lady could *not* be pregnant. She was so skinny everywhere else, there was no way she would only be fat on her stomach. 

So what do I do? I decided I had to call her bluff, so I said a small ""Yeah, right."" and then, I shit you not, proceeded to place my hand on her stomach and felt around for at least a good second or two. I don't know WHAT I expected. For the baby to suddenly kick as soon as I touched her stomach to assert dominance? For there to be a truth button on her stomach or something that forced her to tell me that she's pregnant? 

Nope. Turns out she wasn't pregnant, and her stomach wasn't even fat. So, basically, she was wearing like this kinda black cocktail, really puffy dress with multiple layers that started right beneath her boobs. So, when she sat down, it like, *pushed* all that puff to the front and it created like this OPTICAL ILLUSION and made it genuinely look like she was pregnant. So, when I decide to touch her stomach, all of that collapsed and I was just kinda molesting her. 

I didn't know what to say. At this point, I knew I fucked up for good. I just squeaked out a tiny ""Oh, right. So you're not."" I was staring at my own hand this entire time. I didn't want to look up and face her. But get this, I was so embarrassed and frozen that I didn't even move my hand for another good second or two until *she herself* had to move so my hand was no longer laying on my stomach. The rest of the dinner was the most awkward one I had to sit through. 

TL;DR - Women's fashion designs made me accidentally molest a woman for a few seconds. Optical illusions are a bitch.

3tceb5,non_TBI,"**Obligatory: This was 7th grade, I'm now a Junior in high school**

So there was this one kid in my class that *everyone* hated. He was the biggest arse to anyone he met, and I think at one point he was even caught wanking in the ladies room. 

Let's call him Derp. Derp was a guy who thought he was super smart, and he and I were kinda mutual friends. Like not the kind of friends who ever text or talk about anything cool, more just like the friends who exchange homework answers. 

Now me: I'm a programmer. I've been a computer geek for the longest time, and ive been a badass with all kinds of coding. This was kinda common knowledge. There was also a rumor that I could hack anything, though that was quite false.

Anyway, one day I decided to prank this Derp. I managed to convince him that I could code him a program that could hack *any* website, and access any account ever created anywhere. I told him I had used it to break into the Pentagon and learn government secrets, and hack apple and screw up the creation of the new iPad. Of course, he believed me and agreed to try it. 

I go home and crack my knuckles, then bring up all kinds of programs. After 2 hours of work, I come up with the master program:

It was an install wizard. It looked very professional, and rapidly installed ""UberHack"" to your system. In reality, it installed a video of various drawings of dicks popping up all over the screen, as well as running a shutdown script in the background. As soon as the video finished, the computer turns off. And this pops up every time you log in. **MWAHAHAHA**

Whelp, here comes the fuckup. I give it to him the next day, all prepared and awesome. As I hand him the flash drive, I repeat ""DO NOT install this on school computers. The blocking software they have can track you, me, and it can even screw up the computers. Do **NOT** install it on any school PC.""

Two days later I get called to the office. He installed it on *not one, not two, but* **22 FUCKING SCHOOL COMPUTERS!**  Once he was caught, he was quick to rat me out as to redirect the blame. I explained myself in saying it was a harmless prank, and could easily be uninstalled with the proper knowledge (which was literally alt+f4 and delete it out of the startup folder).

Miraculously, I got off with a warning and he was suspended for a week. I also was tasked with removing it from all the computers, which was quite embarrassing. But hell, it was funny. And it got me this story.

Tl:Dr: Trolled the classhole by making dicks appear on his pc whenever he turns it on, the idiot installs it on 22 fuckin school computers, didn't get brutally murdered by school officials.

**Edit:** Alot are asking about the program itself. It was **NOT** any sort of virus, and was as simple as an easy shutdown batch file and a video put together into an install wizard and installed into a startup folder.

**Edit 2:** Holy hell, I've never been on the front page before! I HAVE ASCENDED!

**Edit 3:** Alot of people are calling me a bully. This kid was hated for a reason, and that's because *he* was a huge bully and asshat to everyone in the school. He didn't have any sort of disorder, he was just a cunt."
2y7f3g,non_TBI,"Today I Fucked Up by getting kidnapped

Here's the TL:DR - this is a humorous anecdote about the time an awful woman kidnapped me from a bar, took me 2 hours away, and I was rescued by loyal friends. It's probably worth your time, 


Okay so, like many this was not today, it was a few years ago now, but I was encouraged to share this as part of my healing process. By encouraged I mean harassed and by healing I mean harassed. Settle in, it's a long story, but it's my story. So here we go...

Sophomore year of college, last night of the fall semester, I have one final left at 8:30 the next morning. My roommate is packing up to head home for the break and I convince him to stick around and have dinner. He agreed on the condition that he would leave from the restaurant, I then revealed I was already drunk so he would have to drive there and take me back to school. We get to the bar and I promptly order a martini which I sipped once and pronounced it to be gross and ordered a drink called a ""slippery banana"" which included a straw, orange slice, and an announcement to the rest of the bar with a party horn and humiliation. 

My roommate calls our buddy who agrees to come down and join us. Then suddenly a group of women in their thirties walk in and take seats at the bar. We exchange glances and the most awful one, who we shall now refer to as ""Slagathor"" calls me over. I walk to her seat at the bar and she looks me in the eye and says ""Are you gay?"". I said no and she said ""Well you look like a fucking queer"". I said thanks and returned to the booth. 

Somewhere around this time our buddy shows up and we're drunk enough to wander back to the ladies. Flirting begins, drinks are exchanged, someone orders flaming Dr. Pepper's, I spill one on the bar creating a small fire that needed the attention of a wet bar rag, and somehow I convince these women to flash us. Now let me point out that when I said restaurant earlier, I met like an Applebee's, so as boobs are flying, a family of four is trying to enjoy their boneless wings and sliders behind us. The bartender gets pissed and we wander out of the bar. 

Now that we're outside Slagathor begins to insist on seeing my penis, I oblige because I'm a gentleman, she approves. At some point she says something about taking me back to her house because ""I got a 3 month old kid and my husband just got outta jail and I aint had sex in a year"". Red flag? I'm at that stage of blackout drunk where literally anything anyone says is the best idea, and according to my roommate I was very insistent on assisting Slaggy with her situation. 

We get in a truck with Slagathor on my lap and her leathery friend Slaggy Sr. driving. This is the part where I start to see flashes of events that transpired. I remember her rolling a blunt on my lap, I remember a gas station, I remember her kissing me, I remember a parking lot, and then getting in a new car.

This is where the actual ""kidnapping"" kicks in, because I say I want to go home and Slagathor says, and I quote, ""No."" We drive off into the night and I pass out.

The car slams into park, I roll out the passenger door and start puking on the side walk of a very sketchy looking neighborhood. I look up and see Slagathor, squatting IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING ROAD, taking a piss. My instincts kick in and I bolt, I'm running through yards, jumping fences, lose a flip-flop (unseasonably warm evening), and see the beautiful glow of a 7/11 sign. I run to the doors, think about it, step to the alley and throw up Bacardi 151, then crash through the doors and yell ""Where the fuck am I?!"" The line of patrons and the cashiers look at me like a time traveler just asked them what year it is. The cashier timidly says ""...7/11"". I said ""No, like, what fucking city is this"". She tells me, I ask how far that is from my college, she says 2 hours. 

I call my roommate in a panic, he says he's too drunk to drive, so is the rest of the school because it's the last fucking night of finals. He calls a friend who lives a half hour away and tells her I'm in trouble and they need to come get me, he then tells her I'm about 15 minutes from campus. She is a wonderful person for her actions and if this were a military operation I would submit her for a commendation. 

I begin to explain to the cashiers what had happened to me, when I feel a hand on my shoulder and the screeching wail of Slagathor, ""there you are. we've been looking for you."" Slaggy Sr. is there too and she takes my other arm. They walk me back to Slaggy Sr's house where they sit me down on a bench. Some guy walks over and yells at me, Slaggy starts yelling at me about getting her pills? Where the fuck am I going to get pills? I don't know any drug dealers two counties from where I live. I didn't really know any drug dealers where I lived. For some reason I remember a fucking cat coming over, I just sat there and pet the cat because it brought me comfort to see some kind of innocence again. 

After awhile I yelled to the next room that I wanted to leave and Slagathor says not until we have sex, I said I don't want to have sex, she says she'll take me home when she's done smoking her blunt, I said I was leaving, she said ""go fuck yourself"". 

I leave and begin to look for the 7/11 again which is somehow now very hard to find. Then I see it, I march through the doors, past the cashiers, into the stock room and sit down on a case of Pepsi and refuse to leave. They said they would help me but they needed me to come out of the stock room. Much to my dismay they call their cop ""buddy"" to come, I explain the story to him and he shows little sympathy and asks what I want from him. I asked him if he could take me home, he says he can take me to jail. I said I'll just wait for my friends. 

After 2 1/2 hours of insisting to our sober friend that it was ""only like 15 more minutes"", they finally arrive and according to them I was pressed against the glass like a puppy at a pet store, crying hysterically at the sight of her car. My ordeal was over, I took my shirt off for some reason? crawled into the back seat and cried on my friends lap the whole way home. 

I have been sober for 17 months, I know that timeline doesn't match up but I'm a slow learner.

P.S. I was late for my final.

2m982v,non_TBI,"For once in my life, I am actually successfully talking to a girl. Things are going alright, and she sends me some pics so I attempt to return the favor. I take some dick pics with my new iPhone 6. It's important to note, I'm taking and sending the dick pics while I'm pretending to shower. I watch youtube videos on my apple TV while I'm working out so my phone was still set to airplay. 

My sister and mother are watching some shitty show on Netflix while I am ""showering"". If you've ever used an Apple TV you know that if someone from an iPhone sends their signal to the TV it will overrule whatever's currently happening. So their Netflix Show must have been replaced by my dick pic once I opened it in the photos app to determine if it was worthy. While I am touching up my dick pic picture I hear screaming coming from downstairs. I frantically remember ""oh fuck my airplay is on"". That was a bad feeling. They run upstairs and yell what am I doing, I pretend I can't hear even though my shower is certainly not overpoweringly loud. We haven't spoken yet.  


Tonight has been awkward."

Let me keep this short. FML. So you know how when you search Amazon for let's say electronic parts it will recommend other electronics for you. So rewind a couple days I searched Amazon for huge dildos as a joke to a friend. Then today my dad asked if he could use my Amazon account because I have prime. I give him my account details. He then logs in and comes into my room and begins talking to me about how it's ok to be gay. I asked why he was telling me this and he told me how Amazon had recommended me a transparent swirly dildo or some shit. RIP my sanity

TL;DR: searching Dildos one day makes your dad think gay.


Edit 1: so first off. RIP inbox. Second off the joke was he said something that made him seem gay so I searched Amazon for some dildos and sent the link to him. Also no I'm not homosexual or a homophobic

2zgedy,non_TBI,"So this actually happened yesterday however I'm sure most of everyone's posts are.

I should add context before i start. Most of my life i have been a hermit or a recluse if you will. Mostly just sitting in my room playing video games and not really interacting with anyone. Somehow i ended up with a SO (shocked me too!) and at this point we have been together for 4 years. I recently started working at a security company (first job woooo!) in a big fancy condo building as night guard.

Yesterday was like any other day since i started working there however when i got relieved in the morning i followed my routine. Walk to the outside of the nearby mall with the subway in it. Have a smoke and go home. Yesterday however took a creepy turn. While i was standing outside the mall this old man came up to me and started talking to me. I am used to random people talking to me when i choose to go outside so this didn't seem odd to me. The conversation ended with him asking if i wanted to get a coffee with him. I said sure why not. So we go to the nearest Tim Hortons like any good Canadian seeking coffee would and i bought my coffee. He turns to me and tells me he wanted to buy me the coffee. Again i thought nothing of it. We sit down and start talking 
and he tells me how he has a wife and kid and i talk about my girlfriend. Then i get a red flag from him. He starts talking about this bath house he goes to. I start to feel a little uncomfortable but whatever i thought must be a nice old man that likes to get clean in places other than his home. So we finish talking and I say i should be getting home because I have work that night. He decides to walk with me to the subway. 

This is where it gets creepy. As we are waking through the mall he starts to grab and squeeze my arm. There are no words to describe how uncomfortable i was. When we get to the subway he decided he was going to take the subway with me. At this point i wasn't sure what was going on but i was sure it wasn't good. When my stop came around he went for the kicker. ""Do you mind if I touch you? Do you want to come to the bath house with me tomorow?"" I said ""No"" but didn't specify what i was saying no to which i think gave him the indication that i didnt mind being touched so he goes to grab my lovely man bits.... The subway stops and i run out of there so fast that even Usain Bolt was like ""Damn dude! slow that shit down"". As soon as i got on my bus that takes me home I called my SO... she can't stop laughing and explains that the coffee was supposed to be some informal date... I dont know what I'm going to do if i see him again.

**TL;DR Was approached by a seemingly nice old guy, mistakenly had informal date, was molested by old man.**

**Update:** Thanks for all the support, honestly i find the situation to be pretty humorous mainly because that was the least expected thing to happen to me. I thought it was more likely someone would spontaneously combust in front of me than have some old guy touch my no no zone. My SO saw my post, was pretty angry that i didn't mention that when i told her i was being lighthearted about it. Anyway I will update again if anything significant happens.

2lujfz,non_TBI,"Literally happened today, and I ffffed up pretty awkwardly, Reddit.



Technically, it starts a week or so ago when I was moving shelves around at work. My colleague, ""J"" suggested moving an item a little bit more to the left, to which I explained that then it wouldn't line up with the items above and below it, concluding with ""I guess I'm just being a bit anal.""



Apparently [anal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_retentiveness) isn't a term that is used internationally (J is German, if that helps), so she was very taken aback by my slightly crude, Aussie slang. I quickly explained that ""anal"" (short for *anal retentive*) is used to describe people who pay annoying detail to small things (basically). 



She accepted the term, and we moved on.


Today, a customer was at the counter talking to their sales rep, with whom they have a close relationship (more like friends). They were joking and laughing around about how picky the customer was being, and she said ""I know, I know... I'm just being anal!"" 


J immediately lit up, recognising the new term she'd just learnt, and I quickly explained to the confused faces of our sales rep and the customer  **""Oh, I literally just taught J anal!""**




> Oh, I mean... I explained the word... I didn't... Uhh, no, I didn't mean that... Anal retentive, you know? Ughhh....




I floundered like a fish out of water to take back my words, but the damage had been done. Everyone was in hysterics, and news of my fuck up had traveled around the office in minutes.



Now I'm known as the girl who ""teaches anal"". Reddit, I fucked up. 





Edit: Wow. This did quite well over night! 




1. No, OP does not teach *actual* anal. Sorry :c




2. Yes, the term ""anal"" is probably used internationally, 30-something German J had never heard it used in that situation before, though :)



**Edit #2) Most of the responses I've got on here have been quite humorous, so I thank all of you who have had something nice or comical to say.**




**To those of who posting comments like**




>**Yawn**.



**Or,**



>**I've basically seen this post before.**



**I would like to ask you to please consider the following:**




* **Are you paying to read this story?**



* **Am I being paid for the service of providing you with something to read?**




**I believe you will find the answer in both cases is ""no"". So unless you're going to give me some gold for this 'service', please get over it and move on. I wrote this to share the hilarity of an awkward situation, not to make ~~pretentious~~ unappreciative Redditors pleased.**





**To conclude, thank you to all the people supporting my ""anal"" lessons and potential career choices, you're all wonderful!**

2cb9vi,non_TBI,"I'm a graduate student in Oklahoma and I work in a greenhouse. One day while chasing a lizard around the bay where my experiment is kept, I stumbled across a black widow female. I trapped her in a water bottle, brought her home, and put her in a cage with crickets. She ate quite a few crickets and doubled in size while laying two egg sacs. I had smeared Vaseline around the top of the cage to prevent her from escaping, but the thought of having hundreds of baby black widow spiders in a tank just feet from my couch gave me the heebie jeebies.
today, I decided that I would remove the egg sacs from the tank. However one egg sac had already hatched, and there were hundreds of small brown spiders crawling on the web. I was unnerved by the sight of so many spiders, so I picked up the tank with the intention to move it outside. That lasted for about 2 seconds. The lid came off the tank as I held it away from my body and the tank crashed down against the sofa and carpet. Spiders, crickets, and web flew out on impact before I could even realize what had happened.
So, now I'm going to have to bug bomb the entire house, but not before having to spend one very uncomfortable/itchy/nerve wracking night in the bedroom, 12 feet from where I dropped hundreds of miniscule, nearly invisible black widows."

26n3x1,non_TBI,"Sooo...roughly a year ago I was about to take a shower when I decided I wanted to listen to some music to make the mundane process more pleasant. I had already disrobed, so I walked my naked self into the living room to retrieve the computer. My wife was lying between the computer and me, on the floor, face-up, playing with our dog Bert. So I stepped around her, got the computer, then turned to head back to the bathroom. 

Only this time instead of stepping around her, I thought it would be a lark if I pretended to teabag her as I walked by...you know, stand over her and squat a few inches then stop. We'd both share a good laugh at the thought of me tapping her chin with my scrote. You know, something all good husbands do! 

So I walk back over, stand over her face, bend a few inches at the knee--

-- and I tear my quadriceps tendon. 

EDIT: Thanks for the first gold ever, guys! And for taking my dumb ass to the front page :D

3lqndd,non_TBI,"So, I work for IRD, the equivalent of IRS in the United States, and I have 30 sick days a year. I haven't taken any sick days in the past 2 years of me working there. I thought, ""Hey, why not?"" So I decided to have a day off. 
I had a great sleep in, and I thought it would be a nice idea to smoke some pot. I smoked multiple bongs and got a strange call, from my fucking boss. 
She asked my why I wasn't at work, and out of quick & stoned thinking. I came up with the conclusion that I should say I have bronchitis. 

But instead, the words that came out of my mouth were, ""I'm in bed, I have brontosaurus."" 

I now have to attend a disciplinary meeting, this Wednesday.

TLDR: I took a day off and now I'm in a disciplinary meeting."
3bw0tx,non_TBI,"Yes this actually happened today. A little backstory i been working for a electronics store and i recently switched positions for a pay raise. After switching i found i was actually getting paid less than what they said. After i reported they said they'd get back with me. So eventually they told me they sent a ""email"", its been over a month and i texted my boss fuming about my pay and he's like "" Oh OP i was going to tell you you were being bumped up but with a attitude like that wait 90 days. ""   

Edit: So I went in to work apologized to my other manager and he told me the higher up still hasn't replied to the email. So you guys are right my manager is a liar and a scumbag. I can't afford to quit but I am now looking for another job. If you guys want to see what I sent this morning to my manager I'll post it. Btw my first real post on reddit and I'm on iPhone sorry for typos. Thanks for all the advice guys. I want to marry all of you ;)"
2va5zx,non_TBI,"Today was unlike any other day. Being the horny 15 year old I am, I decided to spice things up a bit tonight. I waited the sweet moment for my brother to leave to work so I can proceed with my dirty secret. But today my hand would not do that job. I was too horny for that. I decided to look up some ""homemade sex toys for males"" on YouTube and found one that seemed relatively easy to make. So I grab a ziplock bag, fill it with conditioner, slide it under the couch cushion, and begin my wonderful couch fucking. 
This is where I fuck up. 
It started burning but I ignored it for a few minutes before it became unbearable and decided to just jerk off and slide it in right before I cum. So I'm so close and decide to put it in. 
Now I'm a virgin so I've never felt anything this good in my life before. Anywhoo I didn't realize my grandpa had come upstairs (Everyone else was downstairs). So, here I am pants down at my ankles fucking my couch when I hear the door to downstairs fly open. 
As I previously stated I've never felt it this good so I couldn't stop. 
I came right as he turned the corner frozen like a deer in headlights. He quickly turned the corner and proceeded to tell EVERYONE!
My life is over I'm so embarrassed. 
 and to top it off my dick is on fire.

3her6b,non_TBI,"About 2 months ago I starting having what I described as ""heart flutters"".  I saw a doctor and he said it was probably an arrhythmia and probably nothing to be concerned about.  I'm 34, fit, eat healthy, and this just happens occasionally.  He said that he had had them himself recently (from drinking too much according to him :))

Anyway, today I'm in Bali.  I wake up this morning, go to yoga, eat breakfast, and then start cycling to Ubud.  As I normally do when cycling in an unknown place, I put my phone on voice guided directions and stick it in my shirt pocket upside-down so that I can actually hear the directions.  Very quickly I notice that there's this new ""feature"" (or perhaps I accidentally turned it on somehow, but I can't find a setting for it now) -- Whenever you're supposed to turn, it vibrates at the same time: ""Turn left <bzzzz bzzzz>"".  I immediately thought it was annoying, primarily because of how I was holding the phone.

So I'm cycling, it's fairly hot out (~27C/80F), I'm in direct sunshine, going up somewhat steep hills, and have a maybe 12kg backpack on (that's also strapped fairly tight across my chest).  I approach an intersection and my phone gets confused as it sometimes does: ""Turn left.  Turn right.  Turn left.  Turn right.""  With each of these instructions now comes a ""bzzzz bzzzz"".  My phone starts vibrating for at least 5 seconds non-stop, right above my heart.  I feel my heart flutter and then nothing.

And that's how I died today, in the middle of the road, in Bali.

##### Epilogue

I'm obviously not dead.  I got insanely lucky -- Just behind me, on a scooter, was an Australian doctor.  She performed CPR and later told me what happened.  She said she thought my heart stopped for about a minute.  She helped me to the side of the road, and I had about 10 locals around me giving me water, and candy.  One of them was a taxi driver who very kindly drove me the rest of the way to Ubud for free.

I think I'm okay now, though I'm going to a clinic shortly (I've just been sitting in a Starbucks for the last hour because they have A/C unlike everywhere else).

And I have a date tomorrow night with a really cute doctor :)

__tl;dr__ -- heat + cycling + hills + backpack + arrhythmia + phone vibrating like crazy just above my heart = me dead

2pox5l,non_TBI,"Took out my sim card because my phone was having problems with some updates, so I figured I'd take it out and put it back in and maybe then the updates would start. Well, I did all of this in the kitchen and in between taking it out and putting it back in I spotted some Larry the cable guy chips. Now if you've ever had them you know those shits are delicious(and very bad for you), I needed some right then. Sim card is in one hand, reach in for the chips with the other, my mind is no longer on the sim and I then transfer the chips to my simcard hand without thinking about it,toss them into my mouth and eat them. Soon after when getting back to my update  the sim card was missing..no..i didn't just..i just ate my fucking sim card. Goddamn you larry. Goddamn you. I don't know what to do now. I had phone numbers on there.

2rg7e0,non_TBI,"My wife and I had a minor argument last night, so I figured I'd start the day on a positive note. Get some cleaning done, tidy up around the house, make everything extra nice while she relaxes. Among other things that needed cleaning, we had several sex toys (silicone dildos) that we'd neglected to attend to. Wanting to be thorough, I brought these downstairs, set them in a small pot of water to boil (element on MAX setting), and headed upstairs for a moment to call my dad and wish him well. Quick convo with my dad turns into an involved talk with mom and dad, and about 15-20 minutes later, suddenly my smoke alarm is loudly going off. Having completely forgotten about the dildo boil, I casually get up and prepare to disarm the ""false alarm"" taking place in my house... until a huge waft of black, inky smoke winds its way around the bedroom door. I immediately think ""WHAT IN THE EVER LIVING HELL IS BURNING"" and at the same time hear my wife scream ""&lt;MY NAME> WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!"". I rush downstairs into a kitchen billowing disgusting, black smoke, and see a massive pillar of flame exploding upwards out of the tiny pot, which by now has been boiling dry for probably a few minutes. Wife is panicky, trying to activate the (luckily right at hand) fire extinguisher, failing with it, hands it to me and I finally manage to blast the noxious dildo blaze with the entire contents of the extinguisher.

Set the scene for you... Entire house is blanketed in a disgusting, probably highly toxic smog of burnt silicone, with tiny pieces of chemical ash over everything in the kitchen... I put on two surgical masks and run upstairs to open the windows -- dumb move in retrospect, could've passed out up there and totally died -- but at least this averts everything in our upstairs being ruined by dildo smog.

TL;DR: Tried to ""helpfully clean"" by sanitizing some sex toys; turned them into a roaring hellish blaze spewing chemical toxins. 

UPDATE 1: Placed on my back porch the charred remains of the two dildos and partially melted saucepan (which, by the way, appears to have thrown T-1000-like liquified metal over various parts of the kitchen when I extinguished it). Probably a squirrel picked one of these barely recognizable sex toys and moved it a few feet, at which point it discarded it. Not the tastiest thing they've ever tasted I'm sure...

UPDATE 2: WOWzers. 2500+ upvotes. Thanks Redditors! Glad something positive came out of the Dildolation of Smog.

UPDATE 3: Unreal! Story retold via ""The Men's Room"" at 5pm on Jan 6th, 99.9 KISW FM Seattle!

2v0i07,non_TBI,"So this just happened, and my face is still red. McDonalds as some of you may know is doing this ""Pay it with Love"" promotion. My girlfriend and her son came to have lunch with me and the only real kid friendly place near work is McDonalds While ordering the cashier says ""you can pay this with love, you can give a hug, or high five, blow a kiss"". So I turn to my right with the intent to hug my girlfriend, as I do I reach one hand to give her butt a playful grab while my left hand goes out to a guy standing there to give him a high-five.


It's then I realized my girlfriend was standing on my left, and I was just hugging and placing my hand on a strange woman's backside, all while trying to get a slap hand from her husband. The couple looked to be in their 50's or 60's.


What made it worse was not only did the husband start to go for the high-five and stop, but when I realized my mistake and tried to correct to hug my girlfriend, she recoiled too out of pure awkwardness, making me out to look like some weird fast food molester...


I will be ""paying with cash"" from now on!

2tzmwf,non_TBI,"Vanity is one of the seven deadly sins. 

I run a fashion blog, which in itself should let you know just how vain I am. Today, I thought I looked pretty cute in my tastefully clashing black-and-white patterns and leather boots. I thought, “Hey, I should take some photos after work for my blog.”

I’d started my period this morning with some light spotting, so I just decided a regular tampon would do the trick, with a panty liner for good measure.

Cut to just around lunchtime, when I’m thinking of the delicious salad waiting for me in the break room fridge. That’s when I start to feel it—the telltale trickle. 

Just when I was about to get up to go change my tampon, I felt a gigantic rush flow out of me. A crimson tide, if you will. Blood covered the insides of my thighs, soaking through my leggings. I leapt out of my seat and walked through the office, convinced I was covered in blood. 

Through some sheer miracle, I hadn’t bled through the back of my skirt, and because my leggings are black, no one saw the blood seeping down my legs. I tore down my leggings, managing to get blood all over the toilet seat in the process, and splattering blood spots along the stall wall. It was like a fucking CSI episode. 

I packed my overflowing hell-hole with toilet paper the best I could, sprayed down the toilet seat with disinfectant and wiped off the blood, and charged out of the bathroom and to my car. I keep trash bags in my glove compartment just in case, so I used those as a barrier for my butt, and drove my red ass to Walmart for some giant pads, new underwear, and a change of leggings. 

Luckily I didn’t leave a blood trail all over Walmart (but really, would that have been so out of place?), and managed to get everything I needed, then changed in the bathroom. It was all over. 

So, I took some deep breaths and a Midol and went back to work. Just as I was about to enjoy my salad, I knocked the damn thing over and spilled balsamic dressing all over the front of my skirt.

**TL;DR: Angered God with my vanity, paid for it in blood and salad dressing.**

**EDIT**: Holy shit, front page! Amazing. Thanks for making this crappy day a bit better, reddit. I love seeing how weirded out and confused all the dudes are.

Happened some years ago. Posted this comment in AskReddit and people seemed to enjoy my shame, so I thought I would share here.

36huum,non_TBI,"This technically happened yesterday... but you know, I am calling close enough. Also, to elaborate on the title, I am female.

I woke up at what I thought was just ten at night. Feeling anxious, I took an Ambien. What I did not know was that it was in fact five in the morning. This was due to lag on a seven year-old phone I had to reactivate after my brand new iPhone fell in the toilet.

I always go for a quick morning run at six. Which I got up and did as per my routine.

As I was running, I realized that something about my coordination was not quite right. I turned around on a street I do not normally run on to return to my apartment. At which point, I hit a patch of uneven cement (due to construction) and completely eat shit.

I thought that I was fine, just a couple scrapes. I run to the closest place open at that time of day to clean up. I realize that I am covered in splotches of blood, my shoulder and knee are torn up... and my chin is literally split open.

When I run home to my girlfriend, I wake her up to check out the wound. She becomes alarmed and sends a picture of the gash to her mother, who works in the medical field.

I ended up at the ER for stitches.

TL;DR - Went for a run on Ambien. Got 7 stitches. Yes, I fucked up."
2a570k,non_TBI,"So I am a type 1 diabetic. I take insulin before eating meals since it take 15 minutes to start working. Earlier I took insulin and placed some leftovers in the microwave for 2 minutes. I then proceeded to start a game of league thinking I could eat while I played.
30 minutes into the game I start feeling light headed. But since we were about to win, I ignored the feeling and kept playing. As the game was coming to a close I could barely keep my eyes open, which is when it dawns on me that I am about to pass out due to low blood sugar. With no one else home and too tired to walk I got on my hands and knees and started to crawl towards the kitchen.
I get to the kitchen and since I don't have enough energy to reach the microwave I open the fridge and on bottom shelf grab an old container of orange juice. Despite the orange juice being old I started chugging until my sugar level came up enough for me to stand again.

2dbvnd,non_TBI,"Edit: For those interested, I got 44 PMs in the past 24 hours. A lot were really weird and rude, but most were pretty nice people who just want to see me naked. We shall see.

I am a freshman at [Big State University] and decided that since this is the first time I'm going to live on my own, I should buy a celebratory dildo. I've wanted a dildo for a few years but my parents are uber religious and conservative and with my mom snooping through my stuff at home, there was no way I could have hidden it when I was in high school. I moved into the dorms a few days ago and ordered this (http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KUKg72ayL.jpg) last night. 

I have an amazon account and my dad has an amazon account. Unfortunately, because I set both of them up (my dad is pretty computer illiterate), they both say, ""Hello Katie"" at the top of the page when you log in. When buying the dildo, I didn't bother to check that it was my account before I made the purchase. I guess my dad was using my laptop before I left for school. After dinner yesterday, I got a call from my parents.

Let me set the scene. I'm on my futon when I get the call. ""Hey mom and dad, whats up?"" My extremely conservative, three times a week church going parents, are on their speaker phone. ""Katie, we just got an email from Amazon confirming your hundred dollar sex toy."" My stomach dropped right out through my asshole. This was inconceivable. There was this horrible silence on the line as I was trying to process what was happening. I kinda rationalized that I was going to get yelled, so I squeaked out ""I'm sorry.""

What followed was not a yelling or shouting. I wish my parents had been mad at me. Instead of being yelled at, I experienced a half hour of my parents talking about the benefits of masturbation and why it is healthy and how they started masturbating and how they like to do it now. Since I'm interested in exploring my body, they said I can come to them any time for help or advice. 

I don't want to sound ungrateful. I'm glad my parents were cool with the dildo. The fuck up was when I got to find out in explicit detail how my parents masturbate. 



Final Update: I bought a dildo, my parents found out because it was on their account, and they called me about it. We had a really awkward conversation where they said it was ok to masturbate and some people like to watch porn when they do it but you need to be safe with which sites you visit or you'll get a computer virus. I was flooded with PMs stating that my parents wanted to have sex with me, they must be in a cuckolding relationship, etc. It was fucked up. I was a little mad, but I remember that this is the internet. People are weird on the internet, so I played along. I'm not going to have sex with my parents; my dad doesn't want me to have random sex with black dudes. The edit and updates were generally invented as a screw you to the weirdos who PMed me. The comments have been spectacularly hilarious. "
3v4nlp,non_TBI,"So, I'm 16, living in New Zealand, ready to do my level 1 history exam. I'm not too great at it so I decide to study. I want to get a merit (>80%), so I actually put a decent amount of time into it, at least 12 hours over the course of the week.

Finally, it's the day of the exam. Tension is high, I'm nervous, but I'm prepared. Miss Long - 50 something year old Asian woman who aged worse than John Travolta, kinda looks like a Japanese Calypso - starts calling the student codes. For some reason, I don't hear my code get called, so I quickly ask the teacher if they accidentally missed me out. Somehow, my code wasn't on the sheet, so I run to the office (at this point, the exam has 12-15 minutes until it begins) to see if anyone there knows what happened. Rochelle - office lady, weird obsession with orange objects - tells me that they don't have any record of me being enrolled in Level 1 history. 

That's when it hits me.

I didn't take history this year, I took it last year. I have an accounting exam. In a different building. Which I haven't studied for. Throughout the entire accounting exam I'm wondering whether I have early onset dementia or have a second personality that's a history buff.

TL;DR - I studied for an exam in a subject that I didn't take this year, and probably failed my accounting exam because of it."
34eaeg,non_TBI,"The second part of the fuck up did actually happen today and I still have that sick feeling of embarrassment in the pit of my stomach. 

Little background on the situation, im a first year in University and last year when I was applying and getting interviews for various uni's. I went for an interview at St Andrews University and met this really nice girl on it. She was also hot as hell like at least a 8/10 on a bad day. 

As per usual on these interview days you find a group and stick with it for the day, this girl and I made the same friends and so we spent the day together talking about nerves etc we just generally really hit it off. Important to note at this point I had an unconditional for another university but wanted the interview experience anyway hence my attendance at St Andrews.  

Cue the end of the day and me and this girl walk to our cars, hug and say goodbye, just as I turn around and go to walk away she says: 
""Wait do you want my number, you know so we can like study or whatever if we end up on this course"" 
Me: ""Nah im not gonna be on this course anyway I already got my unconditional"" 
Her "" Oh ok... bye then"" 

And thats it I head on my way thinking nothing of it, get in my car and drive home. Its only later when I am talking to a friend about the events of the day it hits me. FUCK. I cant believe how monumentally retarded I was, I had a shot, she was amazing and I blew it. 

Summer comes and goes and I forget about the whole ordeal, until this semester. I show up for my History tutorial, in a uni at the other side of the country and who is sitting there but the stunning blonde who I shot down without a second thought.  

Commence the search on Facebook to determine her relationship status. Helpfully (or not) she doesnt have Facebook so I'm shooting in the dark here.

Long story short it takes a while for me to work out the courage to ask her out and on the last day, with little chance of seeing her again, as I will not be continuing with history, I finally do so. 

Me ""Yo, so do you like want to go for drinks sometime or something?"" 
Her ""Just me and you?"" 
Me ""Yeah""
Her ""Oh I have a boy friend now"" 
Me: System error ""ah fuck, I mean shit, I mean oh sorry I didn't realize, I'll see you later then... wait no I mean I wont but i'll talk to you late... wait no. Yeah OK im going to leave now goodbye."" 

And thats when I walk away face getting redder by the second. 

TL;DR I'm oblivious as fuck, the universe throws me a second chance but im to late and then insert Ralph Wiggum levels of English from there on in. ""Me fail English that Unpossible"" 

Edit: Still cant English specifically with the words ""shot"" and ""short"""
34tizo,non_TBI,"This fuck up happened last night, and in hindsight it is the dumbest string of events I have ever done.
 I was at a friends house, let's call him Steve-O, to celebrate the Bank Holiday we have here in the UK when we all decide, there's five of us in total, to go out into the garden to smoke some weed. We all smoke and drink until we're all nicely stoned, us being seventeen we all live with our parents so it really shouldn't have come as a surprise to us when Steve-O's dad comes out into the garden to see what were up to. Once he figures out what were doing he goes into a fit of rage screaming at the lot of us about how ""This shit is illegal, I'm phoning your parents yellowstone9098."" and how he'll ""make sure were're all arrested for our behavior."" After about ten to fifteen minutes of Steve-O's dad screaming in our faces I do the absolute dumbest thing I have ever done to life. I take another drag of the joint, offer it to Steve-O's dad and say- ""Toke?""

I've become a legend according to my friends but I'm now grounded from now to end of the summer holiday, and knowing my mum, she is probably going to send me to rehab.

TL;DR Offered my friends dad a joint and now I'm probably going to prison.

I've lived in europe for the last three years and haven't been to one of my favorite stores ever since I moved. Well one week into being in the states I'm walking through target holding a basket by the holes on the side rather than the handle. (Imagine the basket as a comically oversized set of novelty brass knucks).

I try to slip my fingers out of the holes to grab something off a shelf and they wont come out.  Eventually I get my pointer and ring finger out but my middle finger is still stuck. So my wife goes and gets a cart not really believing me that my hand is stuck and I walk around trying to nonchalantly get my finger out of the basket, which is now sitting in the cart. My wife gets me some sampler lotion from the makeup section and puts it on my finger. Still won't budge. I get another idea and we go over to the travel-sized toiletry section and we pop open a small pack of baby oil. My finger is good and oiled by it still will not come out. At this point my finger is starting to turn blue and fat from constantly struggling to get out.

At this point I'm starting to give up on the idea of escaping this finger trap silently and I get the attention of a passing loss prevention officer. I go over all the things I tried and he suggets using some vaseline. So he's over here being a real bro and slathering my finger with vaseline. If I didn't need his help so badly I would have closed my eyes and licked my lips while he was rubbing vaseline up and down my finger to be funny...

Anyway my finger still will not come loose.  So he tries to get a manager on the radio and it takes a long time for him to get to us. In the meantime people are starting to notice what's going on with me and yeah, people are openly laughing.

The manager finally shows up and suggests we call the fire department, I was really hoping it wouldn't come to this but it did. I ask if there's somewhere I can sit where I wont be such a spectacle and I get seated between the starbucks area and pharmacy and sit on a bench trying my best to pretend I'm just holding the basket when people walk by.

Eventually the fire department arrives and they have to use medical scissors to cut all the rings around my finger to get me loose. They then cut one line through the ring my finger is in and I'm able to pull the whole thing apart with my hand.

My finger hurts and I love Target so I'm going to have to face these people who know what a stupid man-child I am constantly.

TL;DR  Local 27 year old man gets finger stuck in target basket, has to be cut out by fire dept.

2cnymh,non_TBI,"There's a girl from my high school who I am very good friends with, and was pretty cute in my opinion. We both had a passion for soccer and also had a few classes together. Naturally, as we began to hang out more and more throughout the year, I began to like her very much. 

Fast forward to the end of the year. Our school had a last chance dance and we both went. We danced together for the night and overall had a great time. When it finally ended (unfortunately), we began talking outside near her car in the parking lot. 

It was just small talk, mainly unconscious yelling due to the extremely loud music, and eventually we began to talk about how great the last chance dance was. I told her that she wasn't too bad at dancing, and then she replied with ""Oh, you don't even know"". Obviously, I asked her what she meant, and she said ""Don't worry about it"". Changing the subject, she then proceeded to tell me about how she got new seats in her car and was wondering if I wanted to help ""break them in(;"".

Not sure what I was thinking for this next part. This hint went completely over my head, and I GAVE HER A HIGH FIVE. WHAT. THE. FUCK. A HIGH FIVE. 

She then smiled a little disappointedly (another detail I failed to notice), gave me a hug, said our goodbyes, and then got in her car and left. As her car disappeared, it hit me. I just cockblocked myself.

TL;DR My crush asked to have fun in her back seat after a school dance, and I gave her a high five. 

UPDATE: I called her up and asked her to get coffee and maybe go to a local scenic spot in my area. Keep in mind, this spot is infamous for hooking up and such because of its emptiness and scenic views. So, I picked her up, and we soon hit it off just like before. It got pretty late and we were just chilling at the parking lot and the topic came toward the last time we saw each other (the time where I cockblocked myself like a handicapped retard). 

Utilizing a technique I picked up from r/seduction, I cut her off during her sentence by saying ""Wait."" and then I kissed her. Things began to escalate, and I'll keep the details to myself. Afterwards, she told me, with a smile, that I was an asshole for not fixing the problem earlier. 

Thanks guys and r/seduction coming in clutch! Never again, I promise! Just kidding, knowing me, it'll probably happen next time. "
3mybem,non_TBI,"Due to some anoying genetics from my dads side I have quite a hairy ass, and lately its been getting on my nerves so I decided to take action. After having some less than plesent experiences with waxing and not wanting to put up with scratchy stubble between my cheeks I decided to burn it off. So with lighter in hand I went into my room and sat down infront of the mirror and looked for a spot to start. Not wanting to go too fast I began with a couple of spots on my cheeks, so far so good everything looks pretty smooth I'm feeling confident so I go for a patch on my taint, big mistake. The fire travled up my crack and set alight to a patch of hair under my balls and stayed there I jumped backwards and frantically tried to pat the fire out and managed to escape with only scotch marks to my balls. it's been 5 hours and my ass has only just stoped hurting but the smell of burnt hair is still strong in my room."
2ld3bm,non_TBI,"Just to give some backstory before my big fuck up.. I had organized my first date with this girl I had been talking to for quite some time. The plan was to cook and invite her for dinner and afterwards take her to see one of our mutual, favorite bands. But before the date, after checking my genital area, I decided it'd be smart to make sure they'd be presentable in case anything were to happen afterwards. So I sat over the toilet, grabbed some trimmers, and went off on my bush like I was Edward Scissorhands or some shit. At the end of the cut there was a mound of pubes sitting neatly in the toilet. I pulled on the flusher, closed the toilet lid, and jumped in the shower to clean myself off and get ready for her to come over. 
Half an hour later she enters, we exchange greetings, and the dates off. Date goes *perfectly* and we click *immediately*. Midway through the dinner she asks if she could use the bathroom and I kindly point it out to her. ""Down the hall, on the left."" However, once she stepped out of the bathroom, something changed. It suddenly became harder to keep a conversation, she seemed increasingly uncomfortable, and a sense of awkwardness hung over the rest of the meal.
Confused at what happened, I excuse myself from the table and head to use the bathroom. When I lift the toilet seat, lo and behold, sitting right dab in the middle of the toilet bowl, I'm greeted by that neat pile of pubes I had cut earlier. Of all the nights, my toilet decided it'd be best to break on the night of my date with a girl I had been pursuing for weeks. I head back to the table, get on with the rest of the date, and never bring up a word of that clump. Fml.

tldr; Trimmed my pubes over the toilet, toilet broke, date was met with a pleasant surprise. 

EDIT: Can't believe this blew up overnight and I'm glad you guys are enjoying this TIFU. This is my first reddit post so I've been leaving replies to the comments to give an update on the rest of the night but it seems like it just gets lost so I'll leave it here. 
Rest of the night went a lot better than I had expected. We had a couple drinks over the course of the night which leveled out the mood. On her way out we kissed and she was off. We're still talking today, so if any of you guys are having trouble keeping a girl interested, the secret might be to just leave some pubes in the toilet. 

EDIT: Wow.. to the kind stranger who sent a gold my way, thank you! May toilet pubes always be absent (or present, depending on your preference) in your life. "
2qge76,non_TBI,"I'll make this short and to the point:

-Wife gave me a gaming chair with speakers on the headrest and bluetooth capabilities

-I invited family over to finish christmas leftovers

-Was showing off my new gaming chair by playing music off my phone

-Day goes by

-Some last minute christmas gifts are exchanged

-I put on a family friendly movie for the kids and parents to watch and tell my wife I'm gonna take a quick shower

-...

-...

-My natural urges take over and I decide to ""relieve some stress"" so I throw on one of my favorite compilation videos (to make it quick). I had the water running and I couldn't hear the porn, I figured it was shitty sound quality of the video so I turned it up to full volume... Nothing. So whatever I release the dragon and continue my shower and decide to put some tunes on (just found this awesome band called ""Rings of Saturn"").  Now I know something is wrong because the music is fairly loud... That's when it hit me like a runaway train... I'M STILL CONNECTED TO THE CHAIR!!! I went to the settings, please have bluetooth off, ON!!! AND C-O-N-N-E-C-T-E-D!!!

-I begged for the sweet release of death to take me... oh but he never answered... I felt heavy pressure on my chest and stayed in the shower for much longer than I needed to... Eventually I said ""Fuck it"" just go out as if nothing happened ""they don't know that you know that they just heard you're spanking the monkey"" and that's exactly what I did... 
"
2yttfm,non_TBI,"As is tradition, this fuck up didn't happen today, it happened almost 4 years ago to the date. I was reminded it of it after reading a few other military related posts, and got the same feeling in my stomach just thinking about it as I did when it actually occurred.

Sorry for the length.

A little back story: I was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 to 2011 with the Army, and as the new guy in the unit I was always stuck in the gunners seat of our platoon sergeant's truck because it was off track and wouldn't stay facing a certain direction unless I held it there. I ended up being a good gunner, so even after it was finally fixed I was allowed to stay on the gun. Fast forward to May of 2011, and we are pushing out on a very important mission of extending the green zone of our Area of Operations(AO). So important, that the Commander and Sergeant Major of our Task Force showed up at our Joint Security Station (JSS) to oversee the 2 day mission. For this mission, we switched the .50 cal on our truck with a Mark 19, which is fires a 40mm grenade automatically. Pretty sure the first time I fired it in combat I jazzed all over myself as I watched grenade after grenade shoot out of the weapon and blow up on all over a mountain side we were taking fire from. It was glorious. 

Now to load a Mark 19 is a little tricky. It fires from the open bolt position, which you pull back using two handles located on the side of the launcher itself, and it actually grabs a grenade and holds it in the open position until you push the trigger down, throwing the grenade forward, dropping the shell casing out the bottom, grabbing another grenade. The feeder paws on top of the launcher feed grenade after grenade onto the bolt face, repeating the process over and over. To load it, you put the grenades on the feed tray, one away from where the bolt would catch the grenade, pull the handles back until you hear a click sound which ensures the bolt is locked in the open position, PULL THE TRIGGER, which slams the bolt forward in a blank fire. We call that the ""ghost round."" Now, you have a grenade on the bolt face. You charge the weapon one more time, and you're ready to rock and roll.

As we were leaving the JSS, I began to load the Mark 19. We were expecting heavy contact, so instead of leaving the weapon with a ghost round loaded, I was instructed to get a round in the chamber and put the weapon on safe. This is where the fuck up starts.

I began putting the grenades on the feeder tray, careful to ensure that the ghost round was in the chamber. I began trying to pull the bolt back, but it would not lock in the open position. Instead, I would pull it back and it wouldn't click into place. I would literally pull the bolt back and it would just slam forward like a shitty game of tug of war. I continue to try and fuck with the bolt, pulling it back over and over again to no avail. Everybody in the truck is talking shit to me, even the truck behind me gets on the radio and asks if I need a man up there to load the gun for me. I flip them off and continue to fuck with the gun. 

My PSG (platoon sergeant) calls up to me and asks if I got the gun up yet. As soon as he starts talking, I hear the bolt click into place. ""Fucking about time."" I thought. I told my PSG that I had the ghost round chambered and he yelled at me to get a round on the bolt face and to hurry the fuck up. Without even thinking, I aim in the general vicinity of the JSS, where my company comander, company first sergeant, Task Force Commander, and Task Force SGM, are all huddled in our TOC over a map, and push the trigger down.

""THUMP, THUMP, THUMP.""

Fuck. I watched in complete and absolute horror as three 40mm grenades jump out of my weapons muzzle and spin their way directly towards the JSS. 

""BOOMBOOMBOOM."" Their explosions echo throughout the entire valley, and our radios fucking ignite: ""Where the fuck did that come from?!"" ""Were those RPGs?"" ""Are you fucking kidding me we're 2 minutes out the gate and we're getting shot at?"" ""Where the fuck did that land?"" My truck? Complete fucking silence. You could have heard a mouse fart if it wasn't for the sound of my butt hole tightening up and my knees clanking together. My stomach had literally dropped to the floor, my heartbeat was rattling my tonsils, and I was just holding onto the Mark so tight my knuckles were as white as Michael Jackson. My PSG looks up at me and goes, ""You're so fucked."" 

He gets over the radio and explains to everyone that I had ND'd(Negligent Discharged) the Mark 19, and then it was really fucking quiet over the radio. I'm still shaking like I'm fucking Mohammad Ali, and then the radio awakens with the voice of my 1st SGT. ""We're going to have a fucking talk about this when you fuckers return. Those rounds landed 50 meters outside the J....Charlie Mike.""

We never got shot at that day, either. I figured my only hope at not losing my rank, gunner position, or any credibility gained would be to perform surgery on the Taliban via the Mark 19, but I never got that chance. It wasn't until our exfil did we take minimal contact, and it was when I wasn't even on the gun, and my PSG's radio guy got the kill. We returned to base and I began doing the Michael J. Fox dance all over again.

We ended up completely pulling apart that gun to find that two small, somewhat important springs were bent just enough to cause the gun to not click back into place properly, which saved me from any sort of trouble, but for 2 weeks I walked around scared completely fucking shit less.

TL;DR: I tried loading my grenade launcher to kill Taliban, instead almost killed my Chain of Command.

Edit #1: had to fix a few lines and grammar.


Update #1: Jesus I never thought this would blow up like it did. Pun intended. Thanks for all the comments and upvotes, I'll try and answer some today. Anyways to answer some of the more frequent comments: Yes, I know about gun safety. I know that you should never point any weapon, whether it's a BB gun or a 40mm grenade launcher, at anything you don't intend on killing. Believe me, my internal chain of command made sure I knew of my fuck up.

As far was what happened after, we were stuck at the J on a rotation of security and patrols, so we didn't get back to our larger base for another 2 weeks, hence why I shat bricks for 2 weeks after the fact. By the time I got back to the J, the bigger brass had left the J, so I was left to my chain of command. Again, I couldn't have asked for a better CoC, but they made sure that the burning of shit and obscure jobs landed on my shoulders. After the complete PMCS, the weapon was sent to the FOB, where another PMCS was done. I did a few sworn statements, and that was the last I heard of it.

Okay, a lot of you are wondering about why I was aimed at the JSS. Well, as we left the J, we took a bumpy road out of the J that led us to a heavily populated bazaar. I was the second truck, so the first truck covered the 12 o'clock, I was told to cover the 10 to 8 because after the bazaar was a lot of dead space, meaning spots we can't see, which the MK19 is best suited for since it lobs grenades. Plus, to the right was a densly populated village, and we felt better about pointing a .50 cal over there instead of a grenade launcher. The shit storm I would have been in would have been a million times worse if those grenades landed anywhere near civilians. The outcome could have been the same, but if any sort of news outlet back home caught wind of it I'd be in jail.

So when the group of 6 came in I handed out 5 adult menus, and a child's menu and a pack of crayons to the little one, and everything was great. Until the little one was quite clearly a 45 year old lady who was not looking impressed, and neither is the partner. The family on the whole was looking not impressed. I of course wanted to roll up into a little ball and die there on the spot, immediately, and thank fuck I didn't bring up the high chair

2f1soq,non_TBI,"A couple nights ago I went to a party, and since I don't have my driver's license yet, my mom had to drive me there. The whole car ride to my friend's house she lectured me about not drinking and not doing drugs and whatnot. I patiently waited silently through the whole speech, and as soon as we pulled up, I leaped out of the car and ran inside.

Fast forward several hours later.

The party is ending. I have not followed my mom's instructions like a good little boy, and I am really, really drunk. I'm leaving and walking down the driveway, about to call my mom to pick me up, when one of my friends calls out my name. He's unlocking his car and several others are piling into the rear seats. All of them are drunk as balls, and even though my cognitive abilities are not at full strength, I have the brains to decline and continue walking.

I'm walking down the sidewalk, waiting for my mom to pick up her phone, I hear the start of an engine behind me. I ignore it, and keep walking. Several seconds later, I hear tires screech and think, ""Gee, I hope they don't die on the way home."" A second after that, the car hits me.

I wake up later in a hospital room, and according to the doctor, I've broken my wrist, hip, both legs, and a couple ribs.

**TL;DR** I choose not to get into a car driven by an intoxicated friend, get run over by the same car moments later.

**Edit:** To answer some of the questions people have, uh, here I go.

My friend who was in that car did not crash. FML. He did get a DUI though. Apparently the cops pulled him over later. Not sure about felony DUI or whatever.

I can type with one hand.

My parents weren't too pissed, they were just sort of disappointed but mostly glad I'm okay.

I'm a forgiving type of guy, but damn. I probably won't be seeing my, uh, friend for a while so I dunno whats going to happen with him.

Also, I have no idea why I don't have head injuries or spinal cord injuries. I got lucky, I guess? Or not lucky, but luckier than really not lucky.

3fibp9,non_TBI,"I work from home and sometimes after long hours of sitting on a chair in-front of my desktop, I feel sore. One of the many ways I found to compensate from all the soreness is to squat sit on my chair and continue working. When you squat sit, you can support your elbows with your knees and I find it stretches my lower back too so I like it. Also one of the things that happens when you squat sit is that your butt-hole is exposed to more free space around it as compared to when the chair's cushion is holding it shut. See.. when you fart sitting on a chair, it takes a while for the gas to travel up to your nose. But if you fart while sitting in a squatted position, it takes less than a second sometimes for it to travel to your nose.

About an hour ago, I came back from a heavy sushi lunch. I came back and decided to sit in squatted position on my chair to start working because I was feeling heavy. I had to sneeze and so I did. The first sneeze was not a big sneeze. It was a tiny little quarter of a sneeze. Much like the kicking sound of an old car when you try to start it before the actual ""vrooommmm.."" After the first sneeze - the second one started gaining its momentum. The second one was about to be one of those soul-satisfying sneezes where you take few seconds to slowly suck the air deep in and then sneeze with all the force available in the universe. Right after the first tiny sneeze, I might have farted. Okay, now I know for a fact that I did. But at the time I wasn't sure. So when the second sneeze was in its initial phase of taking in a deep breath, I felt the taste of the fart in the back of my throat and the bottom of my lungs. Gag reflex kicked in and a pressurized regurgitation started travelling up from my inside. By the time I was about to sneeze - the undigested sushi mucous and rice was right in my throat. And I finally sneezed out a hand full of puke some of which got on my keyboard and the monitor. And some of it went in my nasals and up in my head.

TL;DR - Smelled my fart and sneezed out puke. I can taste the sushi in my skull now."

So i get there and im nervous and i immidiately say ""please...whatever i say during this, dont let it leave the room"" they agree and I go under..I remember being told to please stop talking a few times..but other than that..they kept their word and i had no idea what I said...oh but that is NOT the same story for my gf....she picked me up out back after I got wheeled out and this is her story of how it happened in almost exactly her words ""You got in the car and I offered to drive you to get a milkshake for later, at which point you grabbed my breasts and started whispering ""the wheels on the bus go round and round round and round round and round"" and then fell asleep on my shoulder for about 2 minutes...we hit a small bump and you woke up, you thought it would be a good idea to get a new headset for xbox because yours is getting old, you then said that I looked like a jockey from l4d right now....but then as we pulled up to the drive way you asked me to have a threesome with my younger pregnant sister and pee in her belly button because pregnant girls turn you on...(they dont idek wtf) and you said you would slap her stomach like a bongo and you were donkey kong"".

At this point i start to remember what is going on...i went inside and fell asleep on the couch...my gf was apparently pissed and told her sister what i said.

2fhfb5,non_TBI,"Yesterday afternoon, I was just finishing my homework and ready to unwind with some Mario Kart. Last time I saw the game was in my sister's room. I thought she was at a friend's house, so I barged right in to take it back.

I opened the door, and my heart stopped. My sister was home after all, and she was… having a moment with herself. No covers, shorts down, everything on display. She screamed like something from a horror movie, and I slammed the door.

I stood there in shock for a moment. ""Are you getting dressed?"" I asked, hoping to convince her that I didn't realize what she was doing. No way she'd fall for that though. I very clearly got the full show, an image that I fear will be burned into my brain forever. Fuck, this is my little sister. I'm not supposed to see her having a hand party.

I've been avoiding her since."
366cpp,non_TBI,"Some vital background information; This happened about a year ago now. I was 17 and my boyfriend was 18. He lived with his mom, and at the time she was in the process of moving back in with her husband whom she had been separated from. Most of the furniture was out of the old house, and nobody had any real reason to go there anymore, so it didn't take long for a couple of horny teenagers to realize this was a GREAT spot to have sex and not get caught. 

My boyfriend (we'll call him Dan) and I had been on a road trip that day to the mountains of NC where we had gone tubing and swimming. We headed home and a few minutes of road-head later we decided we would stop by the empty house and have some ""fun"" time. We pulled into the garage and before the garage door had even shut we were both completely naked  and making out in the front seat of his car. 

Dan pulled on his boxers and we decided we'd move our extravaganza into the house. This is my real tifu moment; I decided I wouldn't bring any clothes into the house with me. I was already naked and besides, no one would be stopping by. At this point it's vital to know a little bit about Dan's bedroom. It was built on to the side of the house a few years earlier and includes a side door that opens onto a little deck. The only furniture left in his room consisted of a bed frame and mattress(no sheets, covers, or blankets of any kind) and an entertainment center. 

So we continue our fun on the bed, him finishing pretty quickly and as I'm just reaching the brink we hear the most heart-stopping, awful noise. The ""beep-beep-beep"" of the house's alarm system that is warning us that someone has just walked in the front door. We both freeze, not knowing what else to do. Had there been blankets, we would have quickly covered with them. Had we had clothes, we would have quickly dressed. But we had neither of these luxuries and in our realization of the audacity of the situation, we could only lay there and think about how fucked we were. I'm pretty sure at this point my life flashed before my eyes.

There was a whole 15-20 seconds before the silence was broken by a shrill ""DAAANNNN??"" and a set of angry footsteps marching to the door of his room. My coma was finally broken by the realization that if I didn't get off my ass and do something right this second, Dan's mother was going to see a side of me she would probably rather not. 

I did the only thing I could do; I ran out the side door and onto the deck completely naked. It was probably around 5 p.m. and I could hear the laughter of neighborhood children and the sound of a lawn mower in the distance as I crouched on the floor of the deck completely naked, praying to whatever god there was that nobody would see me. It felt like an eternity, but in reality about 2 minutes later I hear the door behind me creak open. I was too scared to move, or talk, or do anything at all. The sound of Dan's voice broke the silence with two words I will never forget. ""She knows.""

It turns out, Dan's mom was so furious that the two of us were ""taking advantage"" of her and the empty house that she completely forgot that she had come to pick up some silverware she had left in a drawer and stormed off to her car and drove away. Dan and I walked to the car and dressed in uncomfortable silence. He took me home and stayed at his dad's house that night. 

As luck would have it, the very next evening was Dan's graduation dinner and I was seated directly across from Dan's mother. She didn't say a word about the incident and continued to laugh and talk with me like nothing ever happened. A year later, Dan and I are still together and that horrendous day still hasn't been brought up. I'm hoping it stays this way..at least until our wedding, if we ever make it that far. Dan and I joke around about that day..but never too much. That wound is still too fresh; it's still too soon. I think it always will be.

2s9ls8,non_TBI,"My bathroom intermittently becomes infested with ants (I live in Australia, if that clarifies anything). They eventually leave when the weather outside improves or, perhaps, when they realise that you can't eat bath products.
I'm a shower person, but today I decided to have a bath. I began filling it but became impatient and hopped in when it was only half full. It is then that I remember that my bath has dodgy spa jets and I decide to try them out. I fail to notice that the jets are positioned above the waterline of my bath. Within three seconds my bathroom is covered in dismembered ants.
The last ant invasion had apparently all died in the spa jet pipes. They were chopped and churned by the jets/pump and were then liberally covering my bathroom and me.

Edit:
-Compulsory: Wow, this blew up over (two Australian) night(s)

-Sorry, no pics (It wasn't exactly on my mind...)

-No, I didn't scream; I just froze and whimpered for a few minutes.

-Thanks for all of your advice on liquidating the poor beasts. We have, in the past, made use of all of these methods and I can vouch for their efficacy. Since, however, the animals often insist on dying on our property, which results in an unsavoury cleanup, it is often easier to let them go about their business until they choose to leave of their own accord.

Besides, as /u/g2420hd mentioned:

> The ants most likely stored the dead bodies in the jets, opposed to mysteriously dying there.

I probably just exhumed their burial site and I wouldn't like to further offend them through mass murder."
352cmt,non_TBI,"This happened Saturday night.  I was at a swanky bar and had been going at it hard for about the last 8 hours or so.  Don't judge!  My girl and I went downstairs to find the bathrooms, which were at the end of this long corridor.

SO, I go stumbling down the corridor, hang a right into what i thought was the mens room.  Down the hall, a guy is approaching me and we're doing that weird dance where you shuffle one way and the other person also shuffles that way, you go back and forth, etc.

As I get closer, I'm laughing with the guy cuz the dance is ridiculous, and I reach out to tap him on the shoulder and say ""excuse me buddy"" to him.

My hand reaches out and hits a mirror.  The guy I was doing the dance with was my reflection the whole time.

Worst is, a staffer in the hallway saw the whole thing:

2sekpf,non_TBI,"So today, I decided to go to the casino and have a try at the casinos interlinked accumulative pokie (slot) machine which has been progressively accumulating money during the past twelve months without it mega jackpotting. It wasn't until November of last year when the mega jackpot maxed out at AUD$1M that everyone began flogging the machines for their chance to win it.

Tonight, like most other weeks on my night off, I tried my hand at the machine and spent a good portion of my nights capital on it in the hopes of winning something. Having made a small win of $250 and feeling kind of chuffed with myself, I got up and stretched and looked out through the second story floor window at the gaming floor below.

After a few minutes had passed a young gentleman took a seat at the machine I had just been using. He slipped some money in and started playing. A few minutes passed and I hear a loud gasp. I look over at him and he's staring at me, ""I think I got it!"" .. ""got what?"" I exclaimed.. ""I've just won the million dollars!"". It was at that moment I was overcome with an emotion which I had never experienced before as I went through the motions of what had just occurred moments before..

Not knowing what else to do and seeing as nobody else had seen yet what had just transpired, I took this photo. Needless to say, I am sincerely happy for this young man and I just hope he uses it wisely.

TL;DR: Was playing pokie machine, got off the machine, someone else sat down and won $1M.

I sprint out with tears in my eyes coming to terms he is already dead. I sprint over with the broom over my head (looking like Gandalf at the end of ROTK) and bring it crashing down on both his arms in an attempt to save him from a crispy death. The crack I hear is not from an electrical discharge but it's both his arms fracturing as he crumples to the floor calling me a cunt.

TL;DR My mate was shaking mud from his boots so I broke both his arms thinking he was receiving an electric shock from a pylon.

EDIT - Front page on my birthday! Thanking you

A few people calling me out on BS? This happened 14 years ago. I'm sure I'm not the first or last to make a similar mistake. I can't do much more to convince you this is genuine

2nd EDIT - Sorry this didn't happen today. 14 years ago I was still using MSN messenger and Facepic. I'm fairly new to the Reddit party (but I brought beer)

Final edit: Cheers for Gold!"
2eedfg,non_TBI,"TIFU by having sex with my wife. This morning I wake up and realize that the kids are sleeping in today. So I wake my wife up and we begin having morning sexy time out in the living room. As we are going at it like teenagers (moaning, loud exclamations of passion, the not so quiet slaps of bodies colliding) the eldest child wakes up, listens to the racket out in the living room and calls 911, telling the operator that ""Daddy is hitting Mommy"". Cue the two police cars screeching to a halt in front of our home. My wife and I, being in the middle of great sex, have no idea that the police are here until they begin beating on the front door screaming ""Police, open the door"". So my wife and I hurriedly throw on whatever clothes are near us and open the door to four police officers asking me to ""step outside"". I ask what is going on, and they repeat the request while another officer walks into my house declaring that he is performing a ""safety check"". Completely bewildered with all of this, I demand to know what is going on. The officer finally tells me that they received a call from a child reporting a domestic abuse incident between my wife and I. As soon as he said that, my wife and I turn several shades of red while we explain to the officers that the ""domestic abuse"" was my wife and I having 'marital relations'. They immediately understand what happened, and with huge grins suggest that we take the kids' phone away if we are going to make a habit of this.    "
2c20rx,non_TBI,"So pretty much every post I submit here is related to my vagina . . . We fuck up a lot.

My family owns a property in the city, and I texted them all stating that I would be spending 2 days there alone just to relax, do some reading, walk around, etc.

The detachable shower head at home has been broken for a few months, so when I realized that the apartment had one I wept with joy.

My Dad works in the city, and has a key to the apartment . . . I figured that since I told them all I was having a mini-getaway, no one would come bother me. WRONG.

I'm in the shower blasting ole reliable at the goods, while letting out mini moans. I orgasm as I moan deeper.

I wash up, grab a towel (thank god) only to leave the bathroom to find my Dad sitting on the couch with lunch for us as a surprise.

I have a mild heart attack as my face burns red. He said nothing, but his face said it all. There is no way he didn't hear me.

Damn you, Dad, why do you have to be so goddamn considerate?! "
2woqxv,non_TBI,"So, this happened Wednesday night in class..

I have been casually seeing a guy a few nights a week. He asked me the other day if i had any toys and if i did, the next time i came to his place i should definitely bring one. I thought it would be fun and what could go wrong?

As I'm getting ready to leave for school i throw it into my purse (first mistake). Now keep in mind, this is an older one, from like 2002.... You barely have to turn the end to get it to come on. I had every intention of leaving it in my car. But alas, i did not. I get into class and throw my purse into my chair and exit back out to grab something to drink. Get back into class and i hear a weird sound. My first thought was that it had to be all the routers and switches we've set up recently. If you're wondering I'm in a computer class and we set up an internal network of 8 Cisco routers and switches. I Don't remember them sounding like this, but maybe today I'm just noticing it more. I grab my purse from my chair and then it hit me. My purse is the source of the sound. FUCK FUCK FUCK. This vibrator is anything but quiet as is, and amplify it with $20 in change and car keys. I start digging through my purse in a frenzied panic, trying to get it turned off before anyone noticed, but it was too late for that. The guys in the class give me this look, like they know what it is, but they're still curious if it is what they think it is. Also, I'm sure me digging through my purse like a crazed lunatic only gave me away.

TL;DR - Today i fucked up my bringing my old vibrator to class, it turned on when i threw my purse into my chair. The sound was amplified by change and I'm sure everyone knew what it was."
3wbpwz,non_TBI,"So this fuck up actually did happen just a few hours ago. It was the end of the work day. My work partner and I had tiled a kitchen backsplash today. Then between 4:30pm and 5pm, as it was getting dark, we had to load up slabs of granite into the back of my bosses truck. They were granite counter tops that we had taken out 2 days ago, and left them outside until today when we were taking them away. Anywho, we're lifting the granite into the back of the truck. Laying them flat. Granite on top of granite. Well, I'm in front, my partner is in back pushing them in. Last big piece of granite. We get about half of it laying down inside the truck bed. I still have my hand there on the front edge of the piece. Before I could move my hand away for him to push the piece further into the truck, he goes ahead and pushes it. Queue my hand getting pushed forward with the granite. Proceeds to slice off the tip of my finger as it catches the piece underneath the one we're sliding. So, fingertip is now gone to halfway down my fingernail. Trip to the emergency room. Bandaged up. Given scripts for anti-bi's and Percs. Now I'm dead-freakin-tired. Ready for bed. Nite ya'll......

Pics for evidence. (Warning: Missing bloody finger tip.)

*EDIT*

Thanks for the replies guys. I didn't really think I would get half the comments you all have made. 

So it's the morning after. I woke up around 2:30am from the pain from my finger, but took a Perc. Was able to fall back asleep after 15 mintues. The pieces of granite that did the slicing were actually two halves of a single counter top. With a cut out for the sink at the ends. The first half was in the truck, with the sink cut out facing towards the back, overhanging the truck bed gate. The one we were moving into the truck, was going the opposite way. So when my buddy pushed, my finger was in the sink cutout area. It's actually a pretty clean slice . They took x-rays, and none of the bone tip is really damaged. But there is just a very slight fracture, maybe just a couple millimeters, but nothing to really worry about. I'm not doing workman's comp. I'm technically self employed, but my boss offered to take care of the hospital bill. But hey, shit happens. Just gotta suck it up and keep on working my fingers to the bone. 

Anyone else got any tips? Just a tip? You know, just to see how it feels? 

*EDIT 2*

TL;DR, because robo-bot tells me to put this in my post. 


"
3ph8v7,non_TBI,"So last night I was incredibly tired but I had a dilemma. I was really craving some gummy bears. So I decided to go buy some. And i told myself that as soon as I got home I was going to eat my gummies in bed and go straight to sleep. 

Before I go on I should say that I have this habit of whenever I get home in my room I always throw my wallet in the air and see if I can make it land directly this small tray on my dresser. And I've gotten pretty accurate to! Its not the most normal habit to have i know, but it's not dangerous. Nothing's close to my night stand that I could damage and my throw is always reasonably accurate. Its just turned into a challenge for me. The higher I can throw it, the better. 

Anyway, so I came home and tossed the bag of gummies and my phone onto my bed and tossed my wallet at the tray. Only...I didn't. *I tossed my wallet on bed and chucked my gummy bears and phone at my tray.* I was soooo tired  that after seeing myself toss the wallet on the bed, my body still proceeded to masuchwo more throws for my gummy bears and phone across the room Because the weight of the items is different they landed no where close to my tray. The bag of gummies just kinda glided and  hit my girlfriend (who was sitting at my desk) on the head.  The phone hit my TV square in the middle with a good amount of force and then bounced off the dresser and onto the hardwood face first. My TV wobbled after being hit (so I recently moved and lost 3 of the 4 screws from the TV that held it to the base. So the TV was already wobbly and my phone hitting it was enough force to cause chaos) and fell off the dresser, onto the hardwood right on top of my phone. But it gets worse. As it was falling and the power cord yanked out of the wall, it tripped u a bottle of lemonade that I had which immediately overturned and soiled my PS4. My gf (who had gotten up in fright from all the chaos) just looked at me with big wide eyes. I stood their, trying to process what happened. Fortunately I had accidental insurance on my ps4 but My TV and phone are both ruined.
I guess the moral of this story is never buy a bag of gummy bears at 1 in the morning, come home and throw your wallet across your room onto a small tray.

TL;DR was super tired and accidentally thew my gummy bears and phone across my room which in turn destroyed phone ps4 and tv


EDIT: okay so a couple of things I wanted to address. 
First off, I think its really stupid how many people are downvoting calling me Karma whore etc. Check my post history. This is a throwaway. If I cared so much about ""internet points,"" wouldn't I have posted this from a main account? It just doesn't make sense to me that so many people are ready to call out me, this sub etc just because the believe a post is fake. Telling me that I must have a camera in this day and age just because everyone else does. I don't frequent this sub, but this is all just kinda of insane to me. Anyway I was not gonna do anything but just to shut everyone up, I will post pictures. My dad is coming over to take a look at my stuff and he has a camera. So when he comes I will take pics. I'll describe physical state of things for now. 


Phone is completely shattered. TV has what my gf calls ""spiders"" because that's pretty much what they look like. They are large star looking cracks that cover the screen when it is turned on. My TV still turns on but you can't see anything out of it due to all the cracks. And lastly my ps4 doesn't look to different but it now only turn on in safe mode which doesn't allow you to do anything really. I will take a pic of everything. I also will take a pic of my teeth because everyone's interested in me eating gummy bears and going right to sleep lol.


I PROMISE I WAS NOT HIGH.  Lol I don't even smoke. Is it so weird that a grown man has a craving for gummy bears at in the middle of the night?


And lastly the reason my ps4 is insured and not the rest of my devices is because I purchased the insurance on the playstaton store, directly from Sony because it was cheap and in my face. I think it was 2 years accidental protection for 60$ or such




"
2p462k,non_TBI,"I'll make this short and sweet.

I was in the kitchen not doing anything special when my girlfriend walks in and says she's hungry.  Seeing this as an opportunity to drop my pants, I quickly undo my belt and say something along the lines of ""well you're in luck, I have a sausage just for you!"" and begin waving it around like I just don't care.

From out of nowhere my dog sneaks up from behind and gives my penis a sniff and a lick.

1d51ly,non_TBI,"Last night I was up until 4 am playing counter strike on my laptop, eating doritos and drinking orange crush until I eventually fell asleep mid game.

I wake up this morning to find a terrible smell of cancer-oranges and my shirt stuck to the bed, as well as sheets that were stained a lovely shade of piss yellow. Apparently the cap on my crush was not on tightly so it leaked all over my laptop mousepad, sheets, shirt, and soaked into my matress which will likely now become moldy. To add to that my doritos also spilled everywhere and now there are ants.

**TL:DR sleeping with your crush is a bad idea**"
29hbrg,non_TBI,"So this just happened and I thought you guys may enjoy this....I devoted today to cleaning around the house and because of this decided to wear comfortable shorts which did not have pockets. Throughout the course of the day I had to go in and out of the house, so I needed my keys on me. Having a lack of pockets complicated matters for me until I realized something.... 

On my keys I have a container of sabre pepper spray so I have the wonderful Idea to stick the thing down the backside of my shorts  and let the keys just dangle outside almost like a metallic tail. The weight of the can and retention from the elastic band kept it in decently in place so I went about my business. 

Eventually I decide to sit down on a rock pile outside my house and feel wetness followed by an intense burning sensation. After a few seconds I register what happened and rush inside. The little lever on it slid out of the safe position and when I sat down it engaged and a solid stream of the shit came out. It felt like Lucifer had just raped me up the ass with his fiery cock.

Grabbing a half gallon of milk from the kitchen I run to the bathroom and immediately pour it on myself to get some relief, getting it everywhere in the process. While frantically attempting to get the red liquid out of my ass crack my finger ended up inside my anus pushing the stuff further in. To make things worse my SO was just arriving home when this happened and discovered me crying, half naked in the bathroom covered in milk... That was a difficult one to explain....

TIL: Pepper spray is some nasty shit, don't be a moron with it.

**Update- Still a bit sore down there, but most of the pain is gone. Thanks for all the comments by the way, I laughed my ass off ( or at least what is left of it.) 

Edit: Just for clarity here I am a man. "
31lt1a,non_TBI,"A little description about myself before I continue my story.

* 20-year-old male
* virginity is strong
* American born Chinese
* visiting China; vacation
* not fluent in Chinese (Mandarin)

Also, to those Reddit users that know me in-real-life, please **DO NOT** expose me.
I already have enough problems to deal with.

This event did not occur today, but two nights ago, however, it wasn't until now that I mustered up
the courage to post this, because I need advice too.

**Long Story:**

Anyway, at approximately 5:25 PM, on a Friday, my cousin had voice called me on QQ (China's version of Skype), recommending me to visit a legitimate massage parlor (I have been incredibly sick throughout the entire week; lung infection). Apparently, in Chinese tradition, a massage, and drinking boiling water will cure ALL diseases (sarcasm).

Fast forward, 20-minutes-later, I threw on a polo t-shirt, skinny-fit jeans, and a leather jacket, then I headed outside. Now, the city that I am located in has two major streets, packed with various Chinese 'mom & pop' restaurants, and miscellaneous stores. Already walked halfway down the dirt road, on the first street, I noticed a stained picture sign of a white lady rubbing a man's back, plastered on the window pane of a shabby, rundown building, and a rusty metal fence that blocked the inside view. I walked into the massage parlor, only to be greeted by a Chinese lady. Moments later, a pot-bellied bald man had appeared from behind the curtains of a room. The sketchy man had requested my purpose. I responded in broken Chinese, informing the man that I sought after a massage. No fucking joke, the bald-headed guy stated in nearly perfect English, ""Happy ending?""

Originally, my only intention of visiting a massage parlor was to receive a legitimate massage. However, since I was already here, and I was prepared to lose my virginity, I gave up my integrity, and said fuck it. I smiled, then gracefully nodded, handing the sketchy man ¥400 RMB (equivalent to $65 USD). The pot-bellied man informed me in Chinese, stating that he'll select his best employee. Afterward, the greeting lady had led me into the 3rd room, opposite direction of the receptionist table counter. The greeting lady had given me a pair of robes and a towel, then informed me to undress, only to leave me by myself. This wasn't my first massage so I knew the basic procedure. After I undressed and wore the uncomfortable satin, I laid face-front on the cushioned tabletop.

15-minutes later (I think, only to be fatigued from waiting so long), I hear the lady's footsteps, hand washing, and the aroma of burning incense, do I finally feel the womanly touch of her hands caressing my back. Moments later, I felt an oily sensation, and the towel wrapped around my waist being untied. Now, prior to my ""dingleling"" being fondled, I had already grew a chubby in the nether region. As the lady pulled my half-erect penis between my legs, I felt her fingertips massaging my foreskin. Fast forward, 5-minutes later, when I had already pre-ejaculated, and gradually moaning louder, I asked in broken Chinese, ""How much for penetration?"" She stopped; dead silence. Momentarily, I slowly raised my head, and turned around, only to be facing an elderly man. I jumped up and screamed, ""WHAT THE FUCK!?"" Later on, I was informed by the bald man, at the receptionist table, that the elderly man, with feminine hands, was legally blind. How does that make my situation even better? Anyway, I received a compensation for ¥200 RMB, because the man at the receptionist table had concluded that I was a homosexual, judging from my skinny-fit jeans, and double pierced earlobes. Fuck my life.


**TL;DR:** I visit a shady massage parlor to experience a ""happy ending,"" only to UNEXPECTEDLY receive a penis jerk session from a legally blind elderly man.


**Now, this is the part where I ask Reddit for advice.** The old man had rubbed a green herbal essence on my genitals, and I had formed a series of rashes, only to remind me of my regrettable decision to visit a massage parlor in China. What are some home remedies to heal these rashes? I'm too embarrassed to visit a hospital, no matter how cheap it is.

**EDIT:** Thank you to http://www.reddit.com/user/ultraberry for the Reddit Gold Star Coin. I am not exactly certain on what it does, but I am extremely flattered that you were willing to spend money to support my cause."
2no5af,non_TBI,"Hi reddit!

Not really a TIFU, happened several months ago. I was in the hospital after rapid weight loss. Doctors suspected Crohn's disease and had to check through colonoscopy. Note: it was an university hospital, full of student doctors who specialise in a given field. In my case, there was this beautiful young female doctor, with warm attitude towards me and all the good stuff (*you know what I mean, boys*). I was joking with my now-girlfriend on the phone about how to flirt with a medical worker (my girlfriend is a nurse). Never had any intentions to do so, and was always respectful to the doctor in question. 



----------------------------------

###Until the day of the colonoscopy came.

I was lying butt-naked on the operating table, with a bunch of staff around me. The anesthesiologist injected me with something and then we talked for about 15 minutes, after which they asked me if I felt dizzy already. Well, I didn't. They injected more of the same sedative, and we talked for another 15 minutes. They asked the same question again, and I was still as fresh as a radish on a warm April morning. 

By then everybody was kind of pissed off this takes too much time. The anesthesiologist said something in the vein of ""this dude requires a horse-sized shot"", injected me a third time, and asked me if I feel dizzy again. Last thing I remember is that I answered ""no"".

Fast forward several hours. Nurses are trying to push me down, my head aches, and I still lie butt-naked on the table. After I calm down and wake up completely, they tell me the whole story.

The last thing I remember wasn't the last thing I did. Apparently, the sedative had some side-effects, namely turned me into some minimalistic half-Bane, half-Hulk. I started trashing around, yelling and even detached myself from the tubes on both of my hands. Then I stood up, still ass-naked, in a middle of a room full of medical professionals. 

And I slapped the buttocks of that good-looking student. When I say ""slapped"", I do mean it&mdash;apparently, my rear-high-five was so violent, the poor girl had to sit down and later leave the colonoscopy room. 

I stayed for another two weeks in the hospital but I never saw her again.

--------------------------

**TL;DR:** sedative in hospital had some side-effects&mdash;after I was injected with a horse dose of the sedative, I started acting violently, slapped a quite nice-looking medical student's ass, all while being butt-naked inside a room with ~10 medical professionals.

At least that story made my future-girlfriend laugh and we got together almost right after I left the hospital.

**EDIT:** Grammar. 


----------------------------

##Update

Man. I never imagined such a response. Some questions have been raised by fellow redditors, which I'll answer below. I'll also elaborate further on the story.

Apparently, this is called [Paradoxical Reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxical_reaction) and is a real thing, albeit rare one. Mine turned out to be quite violent but judging by some of the comments here (""I was held down by 5 men"") not the most violent one. I'd say it was violent enough for me to slap the poor doctor but not violent enough for a more gruesome ending.

I lost 16 kilos in 2 months time.

It turned out I didn't have Crohn's disease. Thankfully, cause it is an awful disease and I wish ""good luck"" to anyone who suffers from it. I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea (I know, right). Doctors told me to stop eating leafy salads, and it did work. I regained 12 of my 16 kilos lost. It is likely related to some stress I've been under. My reaction to the sedative might be related to stress as well.

I never got the chance to apologise to the doctor. I saw her several times outside of the hospital but never got a ""hey-I-remember-you"" reaction. Mind we live in a relatively small town, I'm not some creeper dude who's following her around.

No, they cannot sue me for sexual assault. I was clearly sedated and out of my mind.

I wish y'all good luck. Be careful with any anesthetics, especially if a tube is to be inserted in your anal tract in the presence of an attractive young doctor."
378qax,non_TBI,"So for a nice day out, me and my girlfriend decided to go paintballing.

We get there, buy our paintballs and other extras ready for a day of ultimate pwnage.

Well, it's the first round and I get clocked in the shoulder in the first 10 seconds. Damn. I'm out.

So when we switch sides I decide to carefully consider my route to the objective. Should I go left (long) or right (short)? I chose left because I thought I'd be clever and go a longer route in order to be sneaky beaky like. I eye up a set of barrels as my first bit of cover.

The marshal shouts ""3, 2, 1, game on!"" and I rush to my barrels for cover like I'm fucking James Bond or some shit.

Unfortunately I slip before I get there, fall on my own leg and snap it in half at the ankle.

So, now I'm in a hospital bed bored out of my mind with a fucked up leg. The worst part? They've got Britain's Got Talent on the ward TV and I can't change it.

For anyone complaining that this isn't a true TIFU, I will retroactively state that my footwear wasn't appropriate. So TIFU by running around a forest playing paintball wearing totally the wrong kind of footwear. gg no re"
2n7vpj,non_TBI,"I've just arrived at work and am pretty sure I've been bright red for a good 2 hours. So this morning I jumped on the train, plugged in my headphones and prepared myself for the monotony of an hour long train ride. As my headphones are blasting whatever music Spotify threw my way, being a drummer, I'm tapping my phone like Michael J Fox playing candy crush.

About halfway through my train ride the carriage is pretty much full and an elderly woman comes and sits next to me, so I move over to give her room for her bags and get back to my music session. As I'm zoning out, still tapping away, I feel someone grab my shoulder. The train I catch goes through a pretty shitty part of Australia so naturally I jump up and prepare to put up a valiant fight as I get the living shit kicked out of me.

To my surprise the person grabbing my shoulder is a pretty attractive girl who I see on the train quite a bit. I sensed I'd startled the crap out of her so I pulled out my headphones to apologise. As soon as I start ""I'm so..."" she just sighs ""Hey do you always look at porn on the train?"".

As I'm trying to work out if she's insane or just crazy I look to my phone in horror. While I've been drumming on my phone I've managed to tap on the Reddit icon which has brought me back to where I had left off the night before; the deepest and darkest corners of /r/gonewild.

I turn bright red and sit back down in my chair knowing that I've got at least another 20 minutes of my train ride left. As I'm sitting there in silence, too afraid to put my headphones in, the elderly lady beside me squeezes the top of my hand and whispers ""Don't worry love, it's perfectly natural"". Kill me.

**EDIT:** So a lot of people seem to think that by ""tapping on my phone"" I mean slapping it like a bongo. I don't know if people have the delicacy of a rhino but using your fingertips to tap on a phone makes close to no noise and definitely can't be heard over the sound of the train."
2pvo5n,non_TBI,"So I was taking a leisurely dip in the water, it was quite calm, not much of a swell. Things were great, the sun was shining and not too many people in the water.
After a while I needed to go to the toilet, I'm not sure really what I was thinking, it probably was the combination between ""I've peed in the water heaps"" and ""It's nearly a 10min walk to the restrooms"" when I decided that I would snap a log in the water. 
I mean what could go wrong? It would sink, no one would be any the wiser.

I waded away from everyone and did my business. To my surprise however the sonna'va bitch floated. Shits don't float do they? I'm pretty sure whenever I've looked in the bowl after laying a turd it hasn't floated.

Well I am not sure exactly what was happening, but I had just given birth to two floating torpedo's, hastily making their way straight for the nearest beach patrons.
Immediately I swam after them, I'm no Michael Phelps, but I quickly caught up with them. I grabbed one in each hand. Now I don't know if any of you have held your shit before, but let me assure you, isn't not pleasant.

At that moment I was struck with fear, I was within 5 meters of people and had two slippery brown trouts to dispose of. Simple decision, I'll bury them under the sand. So I dove down and quickly pushed them deep into the sand, pushing more sand over them.

I surfaced just in time to see my GF swimming up to me. No quicker had I buried them, then they had escaped their salty grave and popped to the surface once more.

My GF looked at them, looked at me, looked at them and screamed.

For the past 5 hours I have been dubbed the Pooptanic.



"
3dykz1,non_TBI,"So here is the [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3decx0/tifu_by_watching_a_guy_cheat_on_his_wife/) in question.



This morning I saw Jill for he first time since pancake gate. She came in a little earlier than usual and as guessed, by herself. Luckily there wasn't anyone else in line so we had a few minutes to chat.


As soon as she walked up she started crying. So I of course walked from behind the counter and gave her a hug. Crying women at my counter happens more frequently than you would expect. 7 times now to be exact. Anyway, after the hug and me telling her that I'm sorry about everything she tells me the basics and we decide to have lunch together so we can talk some more.



During lunch I find out what really happened. Turns out that Jill has had one other person tell her that Frank was cheating. She didn't belive that person fully but was of course on guard. Jill went to Frank's office early that day to try to rekindle the marriage if that was the issue. Lunch, conversation and all that without the kids around to sidetrack them. 


Here are some talking points.

* Jill apologized for yelling at me. She said her emotions were all jacked up which I of course told her that it wasn't a big deal.


* Jill already filed for divorce and kicked frank out of the house.

* Before filing, Jill went out and bought a new car with Frank's money. Apparently the joint account money was mostly his as she paid the majority of the bills. His money was mainly savings and spending money.


* I asked about the anal sex thing. She got super red in the face and said that she would never do it even though he asked constantly. Her reasoning was that ""sex is supposed to be pleasurable, not painful.""  I left it there as my views on sex differ. That and it's kind of a sore subject.


* Apparently Frank wants to already move out of the city and start his own practice. 


* Jill wants the kids and frank isn't going to fight her on it.



So all in all it sounds pretty amicable besides the super public blow out. I wished her good luck and she said she will still be getting coffee with me every morning.



As I'm sure people will ask, yes she is now single. Yes she is attractive for a late 30's woman, and she will NOT take it in the ass. 


No clue if the TWIT is single.


TL;DR  Jill is now single and happy but still won't do anal. (Edit) /s

Edit:  Under no circumstances should you ever perform any sexual act under duress. If you do not want to do something, tell your partner plainly and clearly.  If they insist, then leave their asses.  Communication is key y'all!

3bshlb,non_TBI,"So, not today but today is my first post on reddit! So hello! 
Anyways, I was just in the Dominican Republic, wife couldn't come cause of work and I had a voucher that was about to expire. So I went by myself.
I've travelled all over the world and have always stayed in the cheap areas. So, I was in Sousa found a hostel and unpacked, had a swim, then like all of us do, I went to a beach bar at about 10pm. I sat down ordered a martini or some girly thing and then a few Min's later a very attractive black girl came and sat down beside me, she started chatting all sexy like and offered me a beer. I declined because I already had a drink but she continued to insist and eventually ordered one for me and one for her. I thought, OK whatever I will drink a beer. So reddit, you know those knapkins they put on the top of the beer? Ya well she reached over and said ""let me get that for you"" and started wipeing the top of my beer. Instantly I was like oh shit, she is somehow putting drugs in my drink isn't she.... After she did that, we cheers and I bring the beer to my lips  it's way fizzier than normal so in the same motion I spit it back in the bottle. She kept on looking over her shoulder and I realized she was making eye contact with about 5 big murdery looking guys I put everything together and realized she and her friends were going to rob, kidnap or worse, kill me. I got nervous... Like my whole body was vibrating.... -She looked at them again- I realized I had about 2 seconds to do something while she was looking over at them so, I reached for her beer and switched mine with hers. We continue talking, my voice is shaky, she and I drink. She gets about 4 sips in before she looks at me with emptiness in her eyes, she is wasted and was slurring her words.... It was drugs! She kept trying to pull me to the back where the bathroom was (where they were prob going to get me) she promised blow jobs and sex. I kept saying no I have to go, I pulled away from her and I noticed the guys were no longer there and a cop had pulled up. I speed walked back to my hostel and my heart felt like it was going to burst like a fruit gusher. I got to my hostel and flew out on the next flight.. Don't accept a drink from a hot chick on the sands of the Dominican.

3uomc3,non_TBI,"So this happened like half an hour ago...
My husband and I have been having some problems with our marriage recently, and so we have both been eager to find new ways to spice up our love life. To give a little context, I have an extreme anal fetish and I've always fantasized about someone pooping in my mouth...gross, I know, but essential to the story.

We start talking about ways we can make this happen. We figure if we use an enema to clean him out, we could melt down a candy bar, shape it like a turd, uhm...*-cough-* insert it inside of him, and then proceed with the fantasy.

Everything was going fine...until he couldn't get it out. No matter how much he tried, the candy bar ""turd"" wasn't moving. I started getting worried that I was going to have to take my husband to the emergency room with a candy bar shoved up his ass. Could you imagine explaining that to people?

As I'm contemplating what I'm going to say to the EMTs, liquid chocolate mixed with the lube we used squirts out of his ass. He was squatting over me at the time, and so the liquid goes into my eye and starts to sting. I'm pinned underneath him, trying to push him off, screaming for him to stop while he's bent over the towels we layed down, chocolate ass juice gushing out from him. Finally, the candy bar ""turd"" fired out of his ass like a torpedo and landed with a disappointing thunk on the floor.

We stared at it for a moment, contemplating our failure. Contemplating what lengths the human species will go to when they are horny. Then we both ran into the bathroom. I showered while he sat on the toilet trying to get the rest of it out. He's in there now as I write this....we both feel weird, but the whole thing was hilarious in hindsight and oddly enough it brought us closer, so mission accomplished?

TL;DR Shoved a candy bar up my husband's ass. Neither of us were ready for the results.

Edit: Omg our first Reddit gold! Thank you so much, I'm glad we could brighten people's day a little with our horrible fuck up haha. 

Husband: Thanks so much! to answer a few questions: Yes, its real. All too regrettably real... It hurt, no my poop this morning did not smell like caramel, and no I would not like a Baby Ruth right now. My only regret is that I can't ever tell anyone that my wife and I hit the front page..."
2pal9s,non_TBI,"Before I start this story I should mention that a) both of us have a solid sense of humor, and b) I had my revenge in 24 hours.

I work in a very large building with a lot of different companies and a small restaurant area on the top two floors.

My girlfriend stopped by to visit me on my lunch break, and while we're eating lunch on the top floor, she tells me that her brother's girlfriend convinced her brother to do something by crying in front of him. I made an offhand comment about how I didn’t see how that would make much of a difference and said (in a very superior tone) it definitely wouldn’t work on me. 

My girlfriend asserted that she could totally convince me to do something by crying. I disagreed, saying that because my girlfriend is definitely not the kind of person who cries very often, any attempt to manipulate me through tears would be very obvious and therefore ineffective. I also told her that she probably couldn't pull it off anyway, since she was such an infrequent crier. 

You can probably figure out the rest of the story.

The conversation moved on to other topics, and I had already forgotten about our discussion by the time we go to get in the elevator.

We get in the elevator with three older businessmen and an older grandma-ish woman. Just as the doors close, she starts sobbing out of the fucking blue. 

I announce loudly that the fake tears aren’t going to work on me. It turns out this is a really great way to draw attention to the crying girl in the elevator, and make me look like a massive asshole.

The grandma-ish woman asks if she's alright, and she goes, ""I'm fine, I just had a fight with my boyfriend."" And then my GF turns to me and say, ""You didn't mean it, did you? I promise I'll ask your permission first next time.""

I’m trying to make her break character, so I go “I’m sorry, do I know you?” I swear to God, I almost screwed her up, she half-giggled but turned it into a weird sobbing noise and goes “Do you see how he treats me!” 

I swear to god, if looks could kill.

The three guys were getting off at the 10th floor, so the doors open on 10 and one of them gives me a last look (like he'd like to take me behind the building and beat me to a pulp) before leaving the elevator. Grandma-ish woman is still watching us suspiciously. 

I finally lean over and tell her she won and to cut it out. My girlfriend makes a miraculous recovery, and a few other people enter and exit the elevator without incident. Grandmaish woman tells her to ""take care of herself"" before leaving.

TL;DR: Goaded my girlfriend into making me look like an abusive asshole to prove a point. "
2kkbrs,non_TBI,"Hi there, this didn't technically happen today but I thought I'd share it anyway.

Backstory: When I was in high school all of 17 years old I had a part time job at the Wal-Mart nearby. I pushed carts every shift and honestly was Damn good at it too. Now there was a boy my age named Kevin that also went to the school who was mentally challenged, I don't know what he had but basically he couldn't talk, mouth always open, wrists bent and he smacked them on his chest, you get the picture.

Now the way you had to bring the carts in was through a smaller doggy door type opening in the front glass, it made visibility quite low upon entering the door especially as you had to duck down to get through.

So there I am one day kicking ass at my job like usual. I have about 16 carts in a line that I'm steering/pushing from the back. Approaching the doggy door I look and see that I have a clear path inside. (I mean who walks behind the cart area anyways right?) As I reach the inside of the building coming through I see it.. Kevin is just sprinting out of nowhere across my path. I can't stop the momentum of the moving carts from the back, not for lack of trying though. That's when WHAM I blindside his ass and he just goes flying onto the ground. Screaming and hollering like a dying animal. I run to him to see if he's okay and he just stumbles off and runs to his parents.

Frozen I stand there for about 25 seconds. NO ONE saw it happen.. And I mean he couldn't tell anybody. His parents were on the other side of the store for God's sake, who let's a kid like that just run around unsupervised? All I know is every time Kevin saw me at school from that point on he would scream and run away, nobody but me ever knew why.

Tl;Dr Bowled a mentally challenged kid with shopping carts, scarred him for life.

Poor Kevin.

Edit: Wow, front page? You guys rock! Especially you, Kevin."
2w1k6z,non_TBI,"First off let me begin that Auntie Angel on the YouTube video is a God damn liar. She makes it seem so easy and effortless but it's not. Oh...it's not. 

About a week ago I ran into an article online about a blogger who caught wind of the original video on YouTube and decided to try it on her boyfriend for science. Her boyfriend loved it so I figured, why not?! What is the grapefruit blowjob you ask? You cut the ends off and a hole in the middle and proceed to use it to jack the guy off while sucking the head. 

I sent the link to both article and video to my boyfriend which he proceeded to get as much of a kick out of it as I did. I figured it would be something ""edgy"" and ""kinky"" to try on VDay as a special occasion. Mind you, he told his coworkers about it and showed them the video PLUS he told them I was going to try this on him so the bar was set pretty high!

Come yesterday, we had dinner and on the way home we stopped at a grocery store to buy our new toy. There we were in the produce section feeling and sizing up grapefruits. Thick or think skin? Big enough? Squishy or hard? I felt extremely paranoid and kept thinking we had to buy something else because who the fuck goes to Walmart at 10 pm just to buy a single grapefruit with their boyfriend? Totally suspicious and deviant. So we bought a case of bottled water and I see this guy walking out of the store who glances over at our purchases on the belt and he kinda smirks at me. I'm thinking - HE KNOWS! (When we were feeling up the grapefruits he was standing next to us buying lemons...asshole!)

We make it to the bedroom and considering how easy Auntie Angel made it seem in the video I figured all we would need is a towel. So I have him cut the grapefruit ends off and a hole in the middle - easy peasy, right?

Slip into my nightie and saucily tell him to lay on the bed while I get to work. Okay...this is messier than I thought it would be so I put my hair in a ponytail. I slide the grapefruit down his shaft while I begin to jerk him off with it twisting back and forth while sucking on the head. 

Do you know what it was like? A God damned porno parody, that's what. All I could think of is, ""that lying bitch! This is nothing like the video!"" Don't get me wrong, it made the blowjob taste great but the juice began to leak and squirt everywhere. 

It was running down my chin, soaked my nightie, all over my chest, running down to the floor, soaking through the towel onto his bed and as I later discovered through the sheets and into the mattress. Mind you I'm on my knees trying my best because damn it were going to be kinky on VDay and I'm twisting this damn grapefruit back and forth on his dick trying to make the best of it. 

Everything is covered it grapefruit by now, the more I twist and pump the more it goes everywhere, everything's sticky and scented, and I have no idea what I'm doing anymore. I awkwardly asked if he was enjoying it to which he said he was and that it felt good but nothing Earth shattering as Auntie Angel promised. 

The noise it makes is obscenely loud which mind you, his apartment walls are paper thin so I'm sure his neighbors heard as I could hear noises coming from the other side of the wall. All I could do at that point was count my blessings his roommate wasn't home. 

I gave up and took off the nightgown as it was soaked by that point. The more I twisted on the grapefruit the more juice went every which way. By then I was cackling like a mad woman because I looked like I was trying to squeeze out lemonade by hand except naked and on my knees. 

The grapefruit kept getting thinner and thinner, after like 15 minutes it was pretty much all gone. My hands were starting to sting a little and I didn't want to throw in the fowl like a quitter as he hadn't cum yet. While we had bought two grapefruits, at that point I was like, ""forget this!"" The Mexican food and salsa I had earlier was not sitting well with all the grapefruit and it was starting to come back up. It was in my hair and slowly starting to creep into both all of our nooks and crannies.

I asked him to wash off and he looks at me incredulously. All I'm thinking of is that penis is not going into me like that because it's going to burn or I'm going to end up with a yeast infection. Nope. Mind you it took me a while to realize the juice was probably seeping into his piss slit the entire time so I felt a pang of guilt.  

So while he jumped in the shower I made the discovery on the mattress. It soaked through everything. The grapefruit left a weird, sour smell on the mattress and I began to panic thinking he was going to be upset so I poured some water on the mattress without realizing I was making the wet spot bigger. 

I grabbed the first thing on the floor I could find to scrub the spot dry, turns out it was the shorts he was wearing prior to the deed. Oops. Found a towel and managed to scrub it as best as possible hoping he didn't realize how bad and smelly it was. 

Out of the shower he comes, slips back on his grapefruit shorts and I say nothing. Found grapefruit on the cross I wear on my necklace - sorry Jesus. At that point it was near 1 am, we were both exhausted from the long day, neither of us got off and we kind of just shuffled into bed awkwardly hoping neither of us would speak of this again. Mind you, I can imagine the letdown conversation he's going to have with his coworkers. I'm wincing just thinking about it. Poor guy - he's a champ for letting me experiment on him. 

From here on out when I feel the need to try something out there  I'm excluding anything from the produce section. "
2g4epb,non_TBI,"From a few months ago - I figured I""d submit a post that wasn't sex related.


So I was managing a restaurant a few months ago. For those of you who have never worked in a restaurant, the majority of them are Spanish speaking in the kitchen. My other managers all speak spanish fluently, but since I""m a stupid gringo who studied French in high school, I usually have to communicate with my expo. His job is to make sure that your burger, your GF's salad, and your father-in-law's steak all arrive at the table at the same time. Here's the problem.

My Chef's name is GUSTAVO - but his nickname is PAPO

My Expo's name is JUAN - but he prefers to be called FRANK

My Dishwasher's name is Luis, but I have 5 other Luis's in my place, so we call him COLOMBIA (cause, you know, he's from COLOMBIA)

I have a new server tonight. His name is RAPHAEL.


I""m noticing a lot of items sent back to the kitchen tonight. Burger's not cooked correctly, or without cheese, salads that hadn't been fired as appetizers, cocktails not ordered correctly, etc etc.

So I go up to my expo Frank (A.K.A. Juan) and ask him what's going on?!

""It's Pendejo's fault!""

""Pendejo?"" I respond? ""What the fuck are you talking about!?""

""Him!"" He points to Raphael "" You know, Pendejo!""

At this point I assume that Raphael's nick-name is Pendejo.

Since I'm not an asshole I approach Pendejo and let him know that he's been sending a lot of mistakes to the kitchen. It's okay, but we need to fix the things he's doing wrong. So I begin to shadow him at his tables. ""Pendejo, please make sure they get a steak-knife"" or ""pendejo please make sure we refill their water"" or ""pendejo plug their order in so i can check it.""

Anyway, three days later he no-shows for his shift. I call up my other manager who does scheduling and he says ""Yeah man, raphael said you were an asshole and that he didn't wanna work with you.""

So I go to my bar - I sit down and talk to my bartender (who's peruvian) about ""What does Pendejo mean""


**Apparently Pendejo translates as ""pubic hair"", but really means ""dumbass"" or ""idiot"" or ""retard""**

So the next day I come up to my expo and ask him Why he let me call this poor bastard Pendejo for three days without correcting me.

""I'm sorry man, it was just too funny.""

IN retrospect, I probably would've done the same thing."
2fy7pa,non_TBI,"We have the antichrist as a neighbor. She has called child services on this perfectly nice family multiple times. She complains to my cousin about letting his mentally handicapped child play outside. Any toy that the neighborhood kids loose in her yard is gone forever, and no, she doesn't have a fence. She gets off of her porch and comes down into her yard and takes the toys and breaks them. She truly harasses our entire neighborhood. 

A few weeks ago, some of the teenagers in our suburb blew up her mailbox with what I assume was a rudimentary IED. They did a damn good job of it, because there was nothing left of it the next day, and nobody really heard a loud bang. The mailbox was just scattered in every direction and partially melted. 

After this happened, she freaked out more than usual. She decided that she needed better visibility in her yard to ""see the evil ones"", so she cut down every tree in her yard. She calls everyone in a fairly large neighborhood every day to ask if they terrorized her yard. She's flipped so much that most parents won't even let their kids outside of their house, let alone walk to their friends houses. 

One of her recent decisions was to put custom ""No Parking"" signs in front of her house. She claims it's illegal to park in front of mailboxes, and threatens to call her son, who is a dick of a cop and will try to find some sort of violation on your part. This would have been no big deal, except for the fact that I live in an apartment across the street, and I literally have no driveway, and it's only legal to park on her side of the street. 

The other night, it was really late, and since all other spots were taken, I parked with my bumper in her no parking zone. I woke up the next morning to a call from my cousin, and he said that I was getting a ticket. I rush outside to see her son walking away from my car, with a ticket on the windshield. I was 2 inches farther out than I was supposed to be. 2 freaking inches.

 Instead of fighting the ticket, it was only 20 bucks, I decided that two could play at her game. Someone, not saying it was me, bought around 40 matchbox cars. One day after she left to go to her weekly exorcism er church service,  someone, again, not necessarily me, glued all of these toy cars in front of her house in her no parking zone. Whoever it was used the good glue too, not some cheap adhesive that would come up easily. 

She came home, and thought these were some happy little 10 year old's toy cars, so she went outside with a garbage bag to throw them all out. Watching her try and try to pick them up was one of the most satisfying things I have ever seen, even if it did only last 5 minutes. She called her son, who took a shovel to them, and did a number to the road getting them up. The big homeschooled family in our neighborhood all went outside to watch from the safety of their porch. One of the kids actually taped her screaming at her son to get them up. I hope to get that video soon. They went inside after she started screaming at them. 

After the damage had been done to her road, she tried to deduce who would do such a thing to her. Eventually, she decided that I did it, since she had been nastiest to me lately. She began by posting ""police notices"" on my door that said ""we know you did it"" and ""you are guilty"". She went as far as to make a fake court notice. And yes, it was fake, I checked.

 My boss gave us today off because we reached our monthly quota really early and she's awesome like that, so I planned on spending the day relaxing, catching up on some Grand Theft Auto. Crazy Lady saw my car in my cousin's driveway (I've been parking their for safety) and decide that today was the day she was going to act. She walked over to my apartment's door with a lawn chair, and sat down in front of it. She called me multiple times to explain that she knew it was me, and that I wasn't allowed to leave my house until I confessed. Normally this wouldn't phase me, but despite her age, satan flows though this woman and she is very capable of inflicting harm upon me. I would call the police, but I'm worried her son would respond and not do a thing about it. My floor is the second floor, so jumping out would be a conceivable option, but I'm in a sling right now because of a skateboarding accident. 

So I'm stuck in my apartment with no escape, being tormented with phone calls by my psychotic neighbor who will not let me out. I cannot call the police, and I am out of milk. Any way I try to get this woman away from my door will result in her either suing me or pressing charges against me. I'm a prisoner in my own man cave. And that is how I fucked up.

Update: As of 8:52 pm, she has retreated back to her lair. I'm going to make sure she doesn't see me slip out, then spend the night at my cousins a few doors down. I'm then going to set up a video camera at his house and I'm recording all of my phone calls. Hopefully she repeats this behavior tomorrow.

Update: As of 9:09 pm, I am safely at my cousins house. I left the lights on so she'll think I'm home, and I'll use my phone to turn on some music in the house tomorrow. My boss gave me another day off, so I'm going to watch all day. 

Update: Who took the lids off of her garbage cans? It certainly wasn't me!! Oh well, at least our local raccoon population will eat well tonight. 

Update/edit: She appears to have gone to bed so she can be up early to make sure the neighborhood kids don't step in her yard while walking to school. I also believe that the amount of rodent activity on our street is slowly increasing. I know a lot of you have said to call the police, and I know I should. However, after discussing it with my cousin and phoning a couple more neighbors, we decided it's best just to let her go. If we call the police, they aren't really going to do anything other than tell her to stop. I'm too poor to be able to afford a lawyer or to go to court, and she's not worth that amount of effort or money. While she has cost the neighbors lots of toys and outdoor time, and me my Destiny fund, I'd rather make her life as close to hell as I can imagine as opposed to taking legal action. No punishment from our legal system would do this woman justice. 

Update: Landlord returned my call around 10:20pm, he says he's had a past of dealing with her. He's a strict Catholic and she's some sort of anabaptist, and evidently she came over and broke his statue of the Virgin Mary and his one of Saint Francis. He says she's been told not to set foot on his property again, and will deal with her when he gets home from vacation. I told him to not worry about, I hope I didn't ruin his vacation. Anyways, he'll be gone for the 5 more days, so until then, I'm going to keep pranking this lady in any fun and safe way I can.

Update: As of 6:08am, she has risen from depths of her house and is gazing at the street. Today I watch for her to retaliate. Upon her retaliation will my iron fist come down with Old Testament fury. 

Update: As of 6:45am, the kids are safely on the bus. No problems this morning. She has returned to her home where I believe she is watching the mean streets of my suburb from her bedroom window. I have a camera ready in case she emerges from the depths. 

Update: 8:06am, my cousin leaves for work around 9, so I'm leaving to go get breakfast for him and his wife for letting me crash at their place. Upon my return, I will take some pictures of her latest ""No Parking"" Sign, create an Imgur account, and post them. Just as a pre warning, I will be taking these photos from some distance. I will snap until I get one that can be read. I apologize now for the potato quality to come. 

Edits from reading the comments: Thanks for the tips guys!! I read the local parking laws and checked to make sure what she did was illegal with the parking signs. Needless to say, many of you have great ideas for harmless comedic revenge. I promise to keep posting with photos the next time she does something to me, my neighbors, or my house. In the meantime, I will ponder on more harmless revenge tactics. 

Mobile Update: As of 9:00 am, I received a text from my cousins wife. Apparently shes out in her yard mowing, so I wont be able to return for another hour.

Update: I'm home as of 12:13pm. Nothing crazy has happened yet. She sits, ever vigilant upon her wicker throne. Only two missed calls from her today. Once again, she phoned all of our near neighbors about the mailbox. I have a picture of her no parking sign, and I will post it as soon as I am finished editing all location information out of it. Conversing with another neighbor, he had a darwin fish on his car when he first moved here, now it's gone. He suspects it was her that removed it. I have to go back to my house to get my stuff for work at some point. While there isn't much, my movement is impeded by my cast. I'm going to try to get my stuff at the same time the school kids come by and there's more people outside. Wish me luck!!

Edit: For those saying that she has a legitimate medical problem, I assure you, she does not. She has been nasty her entire life from what I've been told. Other neighbors have tried being nice to her, the homeschooled family even invited her to dinner, which she promptly refused because they were ""Mary worshiping demons."" This family is one of the nicest I have ever met. They routinely give me food and invite me over to do stuff at their house, even when they didn't know me that well when I first moved in. This family isn't even Catholic either, I'm pretty sure they're part of a separatist Mormon group, but I could be mistaken. Regardless, their kindness did not work on Satan, and she called child servies one time, claiming that the parents were giving their kids alcohol. Child services showed up, the family let them search, and surprise, surprise, they didn't find a drop of liquor in a Mormon family's house. If I so much as thought for a moment that this woman was mentally disabled in any way, shape, or form, I wouldn't do anything to her, but she is simply innately evil.   

Update: As of 8:15pm, all that was lost today was my time. I think she knows she screwed up, and won't retaliate today. I've decided to go back to my apartment. I will post the imgur album from there. Thanks for bearing with me everyone!! Oh, and for those that said I should write a script for a show revolving around this lady, I have. I scripted 2 full episodes of it for a writing class, but didn't submit them because I thought they weren't very good. They're written in the exact style this entire post was, so apparently someone in this world will like them. If I get the nerve, I'll upload one of them and post a link to it here.

Update: As of 10:05am, she has called me twice. She held a cross up at the door when I drove past, and she yelled at some kids for cutting through the corner of her yard. Just a normal day for the time being. 

Update: I'm very sorry for being so late with this, I know I've gained a lot of skepticism because of it. Here is the photo of her sign. Once again, I apologize for my lateness and the blurriness of the image. I'm in a cast, give me a break. 
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/oeLyu8r) 

Edit: There are three more of these signs, just like that one. This one is on a telephone pole about 6 feet from her new mailbox. 

Edit: I'm sorry I've been away for a while. Life cae between me and reddit. As a neighborhood, we decided to have an independent investigator observe her for a day to record her various actions against all of us. We all also recorded her phone calls and recorded anything we saw to compare with the P.I. 
In total, the entire neighborhood of about 40 houses received a total of 204 calls from her in a day. She was taped taking a football from a group of kids, she was taped posting fake notices on my door again, and her son, the cop, was taped sleeping in front of his mother's house while on the job. We are trying to use all of this as evidence to get her with harassment charges and forced to move from our neighborhood. The dad of the homeschoolers brother is a lawyer and is taking care of all of the legal matters. I'm out of my cast, and I just bought Destiny. I will post the videos if I'm ever legally allowed to. 

Thanks for the gold, and thank you guys for reading!!

Update: We lost our case. There is a for sale sign in my yard. The landlord is selling the place. I'm moving to a nicer apartment. The neighborhood kids stole her new mailbox. Numerous mystery pizzas have been delivered to her house. I may have my buddy come over with his old monk costume and act like he's performing an exorcism on her house. I'll post a video if he does. "
2oys4k,non_TBI,"Before I begin, it was about 12 years ago, and 1,000,000 % an accident.

I was a gangly teenager, 6' tall and 140lb. Size 12 shoe.

I had just gotten a new puppy - a miniature dachshund. Well, my dad did. I was bringing my laundry from the basement, and had the basket in front of me. The dog, all 1lb of him, apparently followed me down the stairs, or at least 2 of them.

I didn't see him. My canoe-sized right foot stepped on that poor puppy. I crushed him.

I was distraught. I actually called 911. I didn't know what to do.
The cops came. The paramedics came. The Fire Dept came. After about an hour, they calmed me down. There were grown men crying because the scene was so fucking tragic. They tried CPR on the dog for 10 minutes, but I crushed this dog, so it didn't work.

The first responders took up a collection, and 2 weeks later, went back to the same breeder to get the puppies sister - the last of the litter. When the breeder found out, she drove over to my dad's house and dropped the new puppy off. Free of charge.

Horrible experience.

Edit:  Just remembered, that when my dad came home, the firemen had already gone into the garage, gotten a shovel, and were in the process of digging the hole to bury the dog. Above and beyond there.

3qc4cn,non_TBI,"So my teacher usually leaves the room for like 10-20 minutes at a time every day because he also is the in-school suspension person, and he's a hard ass that breaks up fights and whatnot. I was there for study hall, not for anything trouble related.

Anyway, he got called out to deal with some bullshit today and of course left a classroom of like ~30 people alone, as usual. And awhile ago I found [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/5EpFaEd) on imgur and never found the right chance to try it, but I finally did a few days ago (when I did it).

So I type it all in as fast as I can, and I change the 12000 number to either 80,000 or another number, I just hit a random number with 4 zeros after because I was rushing.

As I'm doing it people in the room are just staring at me and asking, ""Dude what are you doing??"" and I just told them to chill and wait. He comes back in maybe ~1-3 minutes go by after I finish and sits at his desk and continues on with his usual thing (just watching youtube videos and going on facebook.) He's got that pissy look on his face that he usually gets when people talk back to him or something.

Like 5 minutes go by and people keep looking at me and shit, and I just told them to wait. Then all of the sudden 'errrrrrr' and his cd tray pops out. He pushes it back in. Pops back out in seconds. He just looks at it like, ""the fuck??"". Pushes it back in, pops back out, and it keeps going in this cycle. And he starts getting fucking red faced and start slamming it in. Pops out again, and he shouts, ""WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON"" and starts just slamming it every time it comes out and I'm dying from laughter at this point.

and he shouts, ""WHO DID THIS? WHY IS THIS HAPPENING THIS WASN'T HAPPENING BEFORE"" and calls the IT guy, who never shows up.

Next day I get taken out of first period and taken into the office, with police and the teacher just staring at me menacingly. They all talk to me and say, ""We know what you did, tampering with communication lines is a felony offense son"" and the entire time they were treating it like I hacked into the schools system and did it from my house.

Now I'm suspended for a week and 'under investigation'

tl;dr played a funny prank on my teacher who make it out to be a serious offence of me hacking into the schools system. "
3hkza8,non_TBI,"Today I had to make my way to my company's main office. As I got there for an unrelated matter, the HR lady hands me my paycheck and says:

 ""We made sure to include your bonus here.""

""What bonus?""

""The extra $20,000 addition to your salary.""

""I'm not too sure what you're talking about but okay.""

""Hang on""

She goes to speak with her boss and comes back and said she made a mistake and needs to change it.

And that's how I gave up the biggest raise I've ever gotten!"
31aaci,non_TBI,"This happened about 2 hours ago. The prank was entirely inadvertent.

I felt like getting something to snack on from the service station, being that most places are closed on Good Friday. So I put my shoes on, put a jacket on, brush my teeth, use mouthwash, floss, and get in my car. 

Within 30 seconds of driving I encounter a random breath test and me and the car behind me are ushered in to be tested. I am fumbling with my wallet to get my license and the cop says it isn't necessary and all he needs is my 'breath'. I jokingly respond something like ""oh I guess I could give you that"" implying I'm doing him a favour and he sarcastically thanks me in good humour. So I blow into the [breathalyzer](http://www.cmm.com.au/articles/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/breath-test.jpg) for about 5 seconds and he checks the reading. He is silent for a bit and I assume he's waiting for the reading to come up. He then asks when the last time I had a drink and I responded with ""ugh like 2 years ago haha"" and as I finished it clicks that somehow it's a positive reading. So I ask and he confirms and it's clear he is confused because the reading is ridiculously high. I realize that it might be the mouthwash I used a couple of minutes go, given I can still taste it in my mouth. I tell him this and he seems immediately convinced that I'm telling the truth and asks if I have a drink in my car to rinse my mouth out with. I find a nearly full bottle of [mountain dew](https://warosu.org/data/fa/img/0070/93/1382131029398.jpg) I discarded and gargle with it. I get tested again and the reading is 0 and he laughs and sends me on my way. The funniest part was it was clear that I hadn't had any alcohol based on how jovial and non-chalante I was about being tested, then realizing the culprit was something as simple as mouthwash.

Edit: This happened in Australia.

2o0cdz,non_TBI,"Over the thanksgiving break, my mom wanted to go to a comedy club with me. On the way there we talked about the classes I was planning to take next semester, and I mentioned that I was taking Yoga (since my degree required one Fitness & Nutrition course).

Ten minutes into his comedy set, the comedian does a bit about how every man has tried to blow themselves but most guys aren't flexible enough to do it. And then he said ""ladies, if your man decides he wants to take Yoga, now you know why."" My mom loses it, screaming laughter, and hits me repeatedly like she wants my attention. I know what she's trying to reference. I refuse to look her in the eye.

No, I did not decide to take Yoga because I want to blow myself. But now mom will NOT. LET. THIS. GO.

2mo4a3,non_TBI,"Today is my day off and my loving wife left me a boiled egg for breakfast. I forgot that she told me about the egg so after while it got pretty cold. 

I decided to warm it up in the microwave with some other food instead of boiling it again. After I took it out I decided to sit in the living in room and watch Californication on Netflix where I stuck the fork in the egg and watched it instantly explode in my face. 

Not only did the egg go absolutely everywhere but I was also pelted by hot gooey egg yolks. To top it off my cat was sitting next to me and got startled by the egg exploding. He ran across my lap and dug his nails into me. 

I just wanted some god damn breakfast. I'm too tired for this shit. Excuse me while I go get the vacuum cleaner."
2thd1s,non_TBI,"So this didn't happen today but back in high school. My cheeks still get red every time I think about this.

My boyfriend my senior year of high school lived in the same neighborhood as I did, so we saw each other fairly often. He was hanging out at my house after school one day, and my parents decided to leave to go pick us up some food for dinner. We had been dating more than a year at this point, so they were okay with leaving us alone. Well the second they left, we got down to business and the blow job train was a'rollin. 

Since we were both really into it, we didn't hear the garage door go up or the downstairs door open. Next thing I know I hear my dad calling my name coming up the stairs. My boyfriend's pants are down. I've got slobber all around my mouth. Apparently my dad had been calling me on my cell this whole time asking about a clarification on what we wanted to eat, so he had a pretty good idea what was up. 

My bf puts a pillow over his crotch and I wipe the side of my face and sprint to the door. I open it right as he's standing outside of it. 

""Hey Dad, what's up?""

""Hey v_jax, I brought y'all the food you wanted from Moe's, but it seems as if you've already eaten.""

Cue silent walkaway. I hang my head in shame. Boyfriend leaves. I eat my quesadilla alone in my room. "
42znqh,non_TBI,"So, my co-worker's butt is broken. She fell and broke her tailbone and has more or less been in excruciating pain since, so when it's starbucks hour I usually volunteer to go get a latte for her.

Naturally, I usually draw a butt on it with a heart, or a bandaid. (I swear this is normal in our office. We're designers, or something. Mostly just a HR nightmare come to life.) So today my other co-worker and I go into the starbucks and both broke-butt's and mine come out at the same time, decaf and regular lattes.

As per usual, I ask for a marker, and draw a butt, this one has a thumbs up sticking out of the pelvis.

Then another decaf latte comes out, and I pause. A woman with a bad case of RBF is hovering and asking where her decaf caramel macchiato is just over my right shoulder. I freeze and look down, sweat beads down my face as I examine the little order strip. The butt cup is tagged with CM instead of L for latte. Oops.

I turned the butt towards me and nervously presented her with her caramel macchiato. She took it, looked at it, her nose wrinkled as she looked to the barista, ""I don't want one with a butt on it.""

I look to the barista with a horrified *I'm so sorry, oh my god I goofed* face. He calmly offers up an additional cup to nestle it into. She reluctantly accepts this censor sheaf, and without looking at me turns her nose up to walk off as I ask for the marker again.

She might have covered it, but she'll know. She'll know she sipped that sweet caramel macchiato out of that butt cup."
3addcd,non_TBI,"Context: My mom and I need to clean house desperately, so we're doing a deep clean and possession filter this week.  Stuff we want we keep, stuff we don't we trash or give to Goodwill, etc.

So I'm going through my room, sorting things into piles of keep and donate.  On my desk I notice a pillowcase.  *Huh, I didn't put that there... I wonder what's inside?*  I look inside to see if I need to sort this.  Inside there's a cleaning rag, a couple of pens... and a dildo.  This is a BIG one too, like a foot long and about the width of a lacrosse ball.

I have no idea what to say or do at this point.  Conveniently, my mom chooses this exact moment to walk in and check on my progress.  She sees me holding the bag and her eyes instantly bug out.  We stare at each other for a good ten seconds.  It's awkward.  I hold out the pillowcase and say, ""I think this is yours.""  All she can do is look back at me, take it, and say ""Thanks.""

TL;DR- Found my mom's dildo while cleaning, palpable tension as I give it back, shudders 4 dayz

EDIT: Holy crap I didn't expect this to be this big. Thanks y'all for making it this big! Not sure if front page yet, but still.

But seriously, thanks to the redditor who gilded me!"
34t34i,non_TBI,"TIFU when I went to see my friend with benefits for a study break. Things got heated pretty quickly, and soon I was going down on him. He warned me that he was going to cum, so I tried to take a quick deep breath so I could finish him off. I was apparently too late, because just as I inhaled, he came and I immediately started to cough violently. Feeling suffocated, I totally left him hanging with the saddest orgasm ever, while I had panicked thoughts of my mother finding out from the coroner that I died due to drowning in cum while giving a BJ. Luckily, I was able to catch my breath, but have been coughing all day ever since. Here's to hoping that I don't develop an aspiration pneumonia and have to tell a doctor what happened today. At least my lungs can't get pregnant!
 
The slightly ironic part is that I actually got ACLS certified today, so I just learned what to do when somebody is choking, but would have had no way to save myself!

tl;dr- I was giving a guy a BJ, and cum went straight down my trachea causing me to violently cough. "
2y47o9,non_TBI,"I was on the treadmill next to these hot chicks, and I didnt want to look like a bitch so I put the speed faster than I usually do. Well it was too fast and I ended up tripping over my feet and landed very hard. It took me a while to recuperate because I had the wind knocked out of me. The girl next to me stopped her workout and started asking me if I was ok. A gym attendant came over to check out the situation. I was extremely embarrassed and felt like a retard so in my most confident voice, I put on a smile and said ""youre on camera, it was just a prank."". 

I thought my acting skills alone would sell that and I would be on my way, but this fucking chick started asking me where the camera was. I pointed in a general direction and said my friend is over there filming. The gym attendant looked annoyed and asked me which guy is filming us, so I started stuttering and looked for the most believable guy. I saw some fat guy on the bicep machine looking at me so I pointed straight at him and said that guy. I told them his water bottle is actually a camera. The gym attendant was angry and said we dont have permission to film here and said he wants the footage deleted. I apologized and said my friend will delete it if you ask him to. The gym attendant immediately started walking toward the fat guy on the bicep machine. Thinking of the extremely embarrassing situation that was about to emerge, I literally booked it out the door. Yeah Im never going back there again. "
3voadx,non_TBI,"My husband and I shower together regularly, as we are big fans of being naked together. Last night while my husband was washing his hair I decided to be a shithead, because thats just the kind of person I am, and I thought it would be funny to shave one of his ass cheeks.  After about four strokes with the razor he turned around and looking puzzled said ""Are you shaving my butt?!"" We had a little laugh, but then he decided everything needed to be evened out so he went ahead with some all out manscaping- balls and all. After the shower we got ready to lay in bed and watch The Babadook.  Normally we would never eat in bed, but as we were in the middle of a busy stressful week, we decided to plate up some nachos to eat while we watched the movie. My husband loves nachos- and goes all out when he makes them.  He shredded fresh cheese, cut up fresh habaneros, warmed up some salsa and put it all on a tray so we wouldn't get crumbs everywhere. We eat our nachos, watch our movie, clean up and lay down to get some shut eye. After a kiss goodnight, husband reached down to adjust himself and a few seconds later starts freaking out. He had never washed his hands after making nachos and just grabbed his freshly shaved balls with habanero hands. We realized what was going on had to run downstairs and pour the last of the milk into a bowl so he could put his junk in it. So there we are at 12:30 a.m. holding his bait and tackle in a bowl of milk in the living room while tears silently stream down his face. Now I'm telling strangers on the internet about it.

TL;DR: Shaved my husbands ass and dipped his dick in milk."
30lsqj,non_TBI,"This literally just happened. 

So my boyfriend and I are long distance, and like most long distance couples, we tend to spice it up via FaceTime. This morning, his sister had just gotten in the car to go to Ikea, so we started having a nice, private session of cyber sex. I was moaning and talking, like you do, when I heard a weird buzzing and stopped hearing my boyfriend's voice.

I kept moaning for a few seconds, and then heard a very scared and apprehensive ""Hello?"" 

The video was still on my boyfriend's face, so I had no idea what the fuck was going on and was legitimately afraid someone had tapped our phones or something.

I hung up. 2 seconds later my boyfriend calls me back. 

His sister had taken his car to Ikea. The bluetooth was on in the car. When she turned it on, the audio synced to our FaceTime call while the video stayed on my boyfriend. My boyfriend's sister heard me masturbating.

Fuck.

edit: for clarity

edit #2:hello fellow redditors. this is your friendly neighbourhood OP. 
for some reason lots of you don't believe the bluetooth scenario. Clearly if I understood bluetooth, this story wouldn't have happened. 
However, bf's house is a bungalow and his room extends out front, and is right next to the driveway. It's probably about 25 feet? I don't fucking know. 

tbh it doesn't really matter if you don't believe me. it won't make it unhappen. I really wish it could, because now my bf's sister knows what I sound like when I flick the bean. 

goodbye and don't make the same mistakes as me."
2gxx5q,non_TBI,"This literally JUST happened. I have time stamps to prove it. And no, I'm not using a throwaway because fuck it all. I'm angry about it. This is also the short version and I'm gonna be leaving out a few technical details.

So I'm a 911 dispatcher. I just started at a new agency in the middle of July. I had three years experience before starting here, so this place decided I don't need any official training. Wellllll.....they're so wrong. 

About an hour ago a poor old lady called 911 wanting an ambulance for her husband because he isn't feeling well. No problem. Wait. They're way out in the country where jurisidictions get hinky. Welp. So I'm looking at my map and it's telling me which ambulance I'm supposed to send. Easy right? NOPE. No one EVER showed me how to page that specific crew. Oh, and there's no instructions written ANYWHERE that tells me how. So I guess. I find the ""correct"" speed dial button on my phone and dial. Problem there is that  THE DAMN BUTTON IS MISLABELED! Cool, so they call back and say ""Nope. Not our area"". Oooookay. 

So I try sending the next closest ambulance. They say ""hey isn't that [agency]'s territory?"". Sure is but I've failed in paging them. Alright well they said they would go. Welllll....by this time it's been 25 minutes. Poor woman calls back and says ""husband is feeling better. We're gonna go in the car"". 

I'm really glad (and lucky) it wasn't something more serious. I could have killed that man. 

Edit: Well this blew up way more than I was expecting. Couple things for clarification. I couldn't ask anyone for help, which I'm more than okay with doing, because I was alone. My coworker had too much overtime so they asked her to leave early. I didn't  have a chance to say anything about her leaving and I don't think it was up for debate. She was told by higher ups that she had to.

Yes, my CAD system told me which ambulance to send. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the mislabeled button and not knowing how to contact anyone after that. I did eventually figure it out after the call was complete after searching through about eight different radio tabs. I know there are no written SOP's at this agency, but that doesn't mean I quit trying. 

So yes, Reddit. Today *I* fucked up. I take full responsibility for the whole situation. I can say it was lack of training and no written SOPs (which is still an issue) but in reality I should have been able to figure it out a lot sooner than I did. "
2o5c0a,non_TBI,"This literally just happened 1 hour ago.

So I'm just sitting in the classroom, working on some stuff when my art teacher comes to my friend and asks him if she can use his scissors. He doesn't mind and hands her the scissors. She starts cutting something, and in the corny mood that I am I say ""Nice scissoring, miss"".
Just as I realised what I said she looks me in the eye with a cold look on her face. I immediately say that I'm sorry after which she walks away and doesn't speak to me again for the whole lesson.

Did I mention she's lesbian?

*Originally I posted this on Tuesday but those darn mods wouldn't let me. It's fine now.*

Okay, so like I said I went into school today and at lunch went to the library. She wasn't there this time around, so I went to the cafeteria.

Now, I had gotten strange looks and some laughs earlier in the day, so I knew she had spread the word with my mastery to masturbate. 

When I went into the cafeteria, I saw her with her friends, so I decided to sit alone at the table across from her. I had no lunch as usual, so I simply stared at her for, say, thirty seconds before realizing I was being cringy so I went up and sat as close to her as possible.

Immediately, her friends either giggled or called me nasty and told me to sit away from them, so I acted. I read every single comment, and I chose was I thought would be the most flattering and best plan by combining a couple of suggestions.

In front of all her friends, I said something like this:

""GF, I'm sincerely sorry for disgusting you. However, I want you to know that the very reason I chose to jack off to you was because I cared about you.""

I obviously wasn't that eloquent, but she was blushing, so I thought I was doing well.

""Over all the naked women on the Internet, I chose your body to lust to. I had hoped you'd think it's flattering.""

I was wrong about how I was doing.

""Don't talk to me anymore"", said GF.

I was desperate, so I used what I learned from NoFap.

""GF, I haven't jacked off to you in nearly a month. Please, I do not jack off anymore. Not in 25 days."" She ignored me.

I left, in defeat and shame. 

We're officially broken up and I'm now known as the fapmaster around school.

33x9sb,non_TBI,"I have some issues with premature ejaculation, and have had for a while. Today I had to go to my doctor to get a rash on my dick checked out, which I knew might be an issue but my doctor is usually a nice old guy, so I figured I'd be alright. When I got there, though, I was told I'd be with a different doctor; didn't recognise the name. Got in and she was FINE. I mean, seriously beautiful. Just the thought of this woman looking at my dick, touching it, made me feel all kinds of feelings and then BAM. Great. So I excused myself, went to clean up (said I suddenly needed to piss); she seemed to think it was a bit odd but I guess she's seen weirder. (I actually just did it again thinking about it.)

Get back a couple minutes later and we discuss the problem, she asks to take a look. I knew this was coming but I figured I just came, so I should be fine, right? Nope. A single rubber-gloved finger touches my tiny flaccid penis and it pathetically ejaculates the tiny amount of jism that was left in me. Hopefully it'll be the old guy again next time.

TL;DR: Came to the doctor's, came at the doctor, came on the doctor.
Alternate TL;DR: I came, she saw, no conquering involved.

Update for those weirdos wanting to know more: She was very professional about it, asked if I wanted to clean up (I did) and then carried on and asked if I wanted help with it (I am seeking medical help and therapy, so hopefully that'll sort it out). As for the guy who asked how much for some unfathomable reason: imagine letting a teaspoon of golden syrup drip down your fingers and you've about got it."
2uynqs,non_TBI,"This happened a couple months ago, but whatever.

I sat down at a computer in the student center at my school.  There's maybe a dozen other computers situated in the vicinity as well as a couple couches and ping pong tables for people to goof around on.  As I started doing homework, I figured I'd put on my headphones and play some music.  I had been telling a friend earlier about a song another friend and I had made in high school that literally just repeats ""b-b-b-buttsex"" and ""do the nasty"" a bunch of times.  I load it up to listen again for a quick laugh and turn up the volume.  As I was listening, I noticed the song sounded kind of muffled, so I turned it up a little more.  It's almost 30 seconds into the song, and I realize what's wrong just as a crucial point of the song came.  As the drop approaches, I scrambled for the mouse to hit the pause button, but it was too late.  The speakers shouted, loud enough for everybody around to hear: ""SEX! IN THE BUTT!""

Post 2: http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2nqcad/tifu_by_sexting_my_girlfriends_sister_and/

Hello again Reddit. It's been 3 ish months since my last post about this and my inbox is having a slow death. Quite a bit has actually happened in the past few months. I messaged the mods who gave me their blessing to post a final update. So this is it... stop PM'ing me.

We shall refer to my gf as ""Megan"" and her sister as ""Amy"".

(January)

After Thanksgiving Amy stopped talking with us entirely. We tried calling, texting, we even went to her apartment and were told she had moved out about a week earlier by her ex-neighbors. Megan asked her parents if they had heard from her and they said that Amy visited saying she was moving to another state (East Coast). Her parents were surprised we didn't know about it and proceeded to ask a lot of questions that we dodged around trying to keep them out of the whole mess.

Megan used her parents phone to call Amy, she picked up and immediately hung up right after she heard Megan's voice. I told Megan she just needed to give it some time and let everyone cool off until things got better.

(February)

Amy called Megan. I wasn't home when the call happened (work) but the conversation was not productive according to Megan. Amy called saying she wanted Megan to know how sorry she was and she didn't mean for this whole situation to be so screwy. Megan told her it was all water under the bridge, she wasn't mad anymore, understood you can't control feelings, I'm a bit of a doofus, you get the point. Amy didn't buy it and admitted she still has some feelings for me, which proceeded with Megan getting really pissed off. Amy getting upset because Megan said it was all fine but apparently it isn't. Amy hangs up. Megan vents to me about how she could still have feelings for me. I was a little pissed at the time as well, but as we all know. Getting over a crush is a lot easier said than done. Megan realized her mistake of blowing up at her, tried calling over and over with no avail.

(End of February)

I got engaged Reddit! This may seem like horrible timing, but Megan and I have discussed marriage previously (Even before this debacle). It was our 4 year anniversary since dating and I could tell she wanted me to propose. (Baby talk, looking for a house, subtle stuff). As you can guess, she said yes! Her parents had given me their blessing and we asked them to call Amy and tell her for us. (Her parents are well aware that we aren't on speaking terms they understand us not saying what about). They did and we didn't get a call or anything from Amy.

(Two Days Ago)

Amy showed up at our door. Tears were shed, many apologizes, congratulation's on the engagement. I excused myself to let them talk, however I'd be lying if I didn't say I wasn't eavesdropping a tiny bit. Short style: Amy has a boyfriend now, got a really nice job out on the East, would like to come to our wedding. Of course Megan and I are extremely happy this whole mess is mostly sorted out. (Was a little awkward talking to both of them together). I'm sure there will be a running sexting joke among us for a while

**Tl;Dr: Amy moved, didn't talk for a month, Megan and Amy talk and get even more angry, I propose/got engaged, Amy comes back, we all made up, wedding soon^TM . Stop PM'ing me please**

Edit: /u/fistkick18 thank you for catching my mistake in the first post. Much appreciated.

Edit 2: Obligatory front page excitement. Also to those pm'ing me, thank you for the kind words on my engagement. To those sending me videos of three some incest... it's still not going to happen.

Edit 3: To those asking for a wedding update, no. I promised mods I wouldn't post anymore about this. Plus it's months away and there's really no need. If anything I'll just make another edit on this post whenever the wedding happens and let you guys know.

Also I'm not going to correct coach to couch. Honestly too funny at this point."
2ggfw6,non_TBI,"Reddit, My whole life, I have been fluffing up, and here is why.

You may think the Shampoo before Conditioner rule is simple, no? Well, so do I now, but, until less than a day ago, this was not so clear too me. I'll start at the begging. My entire life I have been washing my hair the incorrect way. I have been putting conditioner in before my shampoo. Every morning I would get up and assume that everyone experiences their hair to be a texture like the dried up ground of mars, or to think that theirs was very similar to thousands of pieces of straw. But no, it wasn't until I was talking to my friend about how they wondering what would happen if they put conditioner in before shampoo, that I have been doing it all wrong.

This morning, I tried putting my conditioner and shampoo in the correct way round. After my shower, I put my hands through my hair, and it felt like a great goddess and had got a beautiful piece of silk from heaven and replaced it with my hair. It felt so glorious, I realised what I had been missing out on.

So yes Reddit, my whole life I have very much been fluffing up."
2vbltl,non_TBI,"This happened a few years back. Just a typical day in my sophomore year of high school. My first class of the day, Spanish 2, is just getting started. We start going over our new subject material which happens to be asking people their favorite things. Our teacher has us counting off numbers to put us in our groups. Me and the blind girl are the only group of two, which I didn't mind because she was probably the smartest of the class! Anyways, our teacher drew a random card only that the student could see. Mine read ""¿Cuál es tu color favorito?"" Which of course translates to ""What is your favorite color?"" As soon as I read the card to her, silence. As I slowly looked up at me teacher, The whole class slowly turned and stared at me. Of course the blind girl did not have an answer and started crying. I sincerely apologized and went home for the rest of the day. Our teacher never let us be partners again after that day. 

Tl;dr: Spanish teacher set me up."
3xbqdp,non_TBI,"Obligatory ""this didn't happen today, it happened a few months ago"".

A little background: I'm from a North-African country (Tunisia, to be more specific). Our mother tongue is Arabic and French is our second language.

During summer, me and two of my very close friends decided to go to a hotel and spend the day drinking and swimming. 
Everything went as planned and we were having a good time. We had a few beers and started hitting on some girls by the pool.

Here's where the FU started. Instead of speaking Arabic the whole time and being who we are, I decided to lie to those hot girls and told them we were French. My friends had to go along with it.
We were having the time of our lives when we heard a huge fucking explosion. ""BOOM"" followed by 10 seconds of silence and then everyone lost their mind. 

Everyone was running for cover and we didn't know what to do so we got inside the hotel and stayed there waiting for police to come. Our brains didn't realize what happened so we were still speaking French and pretending to be fucking tourists.

Here's where the FU happened. Police arrived at the scene and started talking to everyone in there and making sure no one got hurt. When they spoke to us, we were still speaking French and told them we were tourists (we didn't have IDs or passports with us). No one bought it so they took us in. 

We went to the police station wearing nothing but some shorts and they started interrogating us. We were still drunk at that time and continued to speak French. They couldn't know who we are so they assumed we were trying to blow up the place or giving information about the tourists inside. FML. 

Long story short, even after telling them who we were, they were still trying to find something that would link us to the other suspects. We had to stay in custody for 5 days. And that's how TIFU, reddit. 


TL;DR: Spoke in French, ended up in custody and being mistaken for a terrorist.

3hkxqn,non_TBI,"I was just taking a stroll and decided to kick this rock in front of me. Turned out to be a snail and now I feel like an asshole. 

Edit: I was NOT expecting to this to blow up. And since I helped snail evolution out so much, I'll walk by the same place tomorrow and fuck up every single snail I can find. 

And oh my god, whoever gilded me is a boss and the snail probably thinks it was down just to laugh at him more. If he's even alive..."
3kkam7,non_TBI,"Let me start out the story by saying that I do not normally carry skivvies around in my school backpack, however I had rolled them up in a pair of jeans for when I spent the night at my boyfriend's place earlier on in the week, and I assumed that when I took said jeans out the red lace thong that was carefully tucked within them was also thrown into my hamper. I believed this until I found myself whipping out my spiral notebook from my bag to take notes for a very impatient and vigilant professor with the panties hooked onto the wire binding. Those exact panties were then flung from my notebook, and of course they couldn’t fall out nicely right next to me so I could discreetly pick them up. No they flew through the air in a perfect arch, with my professor’s eyes following them all the way to the ground where they had landed about 5 feet away from me. Mortified, I got up and retrieved my unruly pair of underwear without a word then sat back down with a face that was probably only a shade or two off from the lace undergarment I quickly put back into my bag. The only person who was probably more traumatized than me was the professor who, for the first time in the entire course, found himself completely speechless. 

TL;DR – Sent my underwear sailing through the air at the beginning of a lecture.

2t9eiq,non_TBI,"I (27 year old male) live with a close female(29 year old) friend of mine.  I have known her all my life and she is like family.  

I came down for breakfast this morning and my roommate made a joke about interrupting my masturbating for eggs and bacon.  It was funny.  I laughed, she laughed, her boyfriend laughed.  To take the joke a step further I joked back that I was not doing that, the way to tell is to hand me something after I leave my room, if I refuse to take it with my right hand then she knows.  Less laughter, awkward silence ensues.  I realize I made shit weird and change the topic.  I put the whole thing out of my mind and go to work.

When I got home from work today I went up to my room to read.  When I came down my roommate walked out of her room, handed me some papers, nodded and walked off.  Every time I would come out of room she would come up and hand me something.  Finally it happened.  I was browsing the internet and somehow found porn... After I go to walk to the bathroom and my roommate hands me two books.  I grab them both with my left hand and start walking away.  She bursts out laughing and runs to tell her boyfriend.  

Tifu by giving my roomie a jerk off detector and she thinks it is hilarious. 

Edit:  Today I came down for breakfast and my roommate hands me toast.  I take it with my right hand, walk to the table, swap it with her toast with my left hand and proceed to carefully eat it using only the left.  She had no idea how to react.  After I was done I washed my hands and left her standing there trying to figure out what to do.  

Edit 2 for clarification.  My room is on the only room on the top floor. It opens to a set of switchback stairs and leads to the hallway. Her room is opposite the stairs. The bathroom is down the hall.  I pass her room on the way to the bathroom.  

Edit 3 for yet more clarification.  I won't touch my dick and then not wash my hands after.  I spent many years as a cook and some habits die hard.  "

Do you know in Windows sometimes when you start to type in a text box that you think is the active one, but it isn't?  And you notice only when what you're typing doesn't show in the text box you want, so you click on it to activate it?  That happened to me this morning.  As usual, I didn't really think much of it.
  
So yeah, I was calling someone a fucking cunt on Reddit.  They deserved it, I carry no guilt there.  But as I was typing this literary masterpiece, my company's IT group decided my computer wasn't safe on the network anymore because of lack of reboot to finish installing updates, so I couldn't access anything any longer.  I figured I'd do a quick reboot.  When I did, Windows went through the whole, ""Do you want to save your changes to document ""Resume.docx?""  I click yes.  Come on, just hurry up and reboot and stop asking these ridiculous questions.
  
Computer comes back, and I get distracted by some email from a recruiter.  I send my resume there.  Then I think, oh well, let's peruse the job sites, shall we?  I find four more great jobs for which I'm totally qualified, and gleefully upload my awesome resume.

Got an email right back, ""Hi Lawrence, please check your resume.  I think there might be something wrong.  Thanks.""
  
Opened Word, loaded the resume, and there it is, right in the header:  
  
**LAWRENCEFUCKING CUNT WILSON**
  
Edit:  Thanks for the gold!  
  
Update:  I figured there was no reasonable way I could come out of this cleanly, so I did what any honorable person would do, I wrote a TIFU.  Then I thought about it some more, and thought, fuck it, and sent them the link to this.  The recruiter responded that this was one of the funniest things she's ever read.  But, she there's no way she would submit me.  So, bittersweet.  I haven't heard anything from the other four.

Edit 2:  Apparently in my slumber, this FU made the front page.  Sweet?  Anyway, there is no update really, but, I want to say that I really like the mix of comments; we have them all.  The equal fuck-ups (""I did this too, sorry bro""), the Workplace Efficacy Committee (""how dare you do this while at work!""), the holier-than-thous (""you use filthy language!  you are a vile, disgusting creature!""), the people who laugh at others' misfortune (I like you folks), and the internet detectives (""did you notice he didn't put a space?  something's up.  that space should NOT be there.  I'm calling bullshit!""), and the Reddit Front Page Assessment Committee (""this made the front page?  Reddit is going to hell!"").
  
But yeah, this really happened, exactly in the manner I described in the original OP.  And I only sent the link to this to the person who contacted me.  I didn't send it to all 5.  That would be a really stupid thing to do."
2cs1y2,non_TBI,"This week, I'm on a ""staycation,"" i.e., I'm staying with friends and family in lieu of a vacation trip. The last few nights I had been at my mom's.

Since my brother and I left the nest about a decade ago, she has turned our rooms into guest rooms.  Thus, staying here basically feels like a free Bed & Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner of my mom's scrumpdiddlyumptuous Chinese home-cooking (and no, we do not have General Tso's chicken or the Numba 19 for dinner every night, or on *any* night).  

She had probably gotten used to the feeling that the entire house is her domain (as is her right)... which also means that she has gotten used to not knocking before opening closed-doors. 

My mom and I are close, and I usually tell her about my new relationships, so long as they're at least somewhat one of dem Orientals.

But the times I've had a white, latina, or middle eastern girlfriend, we broke up before she ever found out, or I had no other choice but to reveal it (like bringing the gf to a family wedding or my grad school graduation).   

I've been dating a girl for exactly 3 months, but I haven't told my mom about her.  Why?  Because she's white, or as my mom would say in Cantonese slang, [*gwai lo*](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gwai%20lo).  

My mom being an Asian mother, judges my gfs just as much as she judges me (WHY NO DOCTA DEGWEE, Death_Star_?  Why no Harvard?  Sorry, a JD will have to do, mama).  The girl I'm dating is in summer school so that she can finish a semester early in the State university in our city.  Going to a State school -- unless it's Berkree or U-SEE-ER-A -- is frowned upon by my mom.  Me? I don't care, so long as she's not the type to not know the difference between their and thurr.   So, the combination of a gwai lo/white girl, a State school student, and a girl about 9 years younger than I am is not exactly my mom's dream.  

Thus, my mom thinks I'm single and has zero reason to believe that I'd have a girl over at her house, day time or otherwise.  This is crucial, since maybe she would have been more cautious about opening closed-doors, but that's for later....

Anyway, Mom works 7-4pm.  I invite ""Erin"" over for lunch.  I cook her the Numba 6 since it's a special-ish occasion (3 month anniversary).  She had class from 8am-1150am, and I went to bed around 3am last night writing the next Great American Novel (""Faster than the Speed of Love, Part II""), since I have no time during work to write.  In other words, we were both pretty tired by the time lunch was over.  

We nonetheless head back to my ""guest room"" and fool around for a bit.  Erin's on her rag (which I usually wouldn't mind for sexy time, but Erin's not at that stage yet), so there was a lot of necking and dry humping, and it eventually led to some *me* time, i.e. I got a *deep-tongue* Beej (get it? bc I'm Asian and can't hit her throat, ROR, er LOL).   

Being male, having just finished eating, and having just getting my nuts sucked through my urethra (with her continuing to hoover it after I finished, which is part torture and part ecstasy, you guys know that feeling)...I essentially got instantly paralyzed.

We were both so tired that she left her top off, and my shorts were around my ankles. We snuggled and kissed (yes, it's just my own jizz, show your girl some love and respect).

The bed is feng-shui'd in such a way that the head-to-toe direction goes from the wall to the door, so when you look through the door you see the bed length-wise, beginning with the foot of the bed.

My mom works 7-4pm. We finished around 2pm.   The plan was to have Erin leave before 4pm, i.e. before mom gets home (as a 31 year old, it's embarrassing, I know).  

But we were gassed, flat-out tired.  So tired that we were both half-clothed, and more critically, we passed the F out within minutes.  I figured, a 20 min nap wouldn't hurt, we might even get to watch a Game of Thrones episode together before she leaves.  

But this was no ordinary nap.  This was not a power nap, but a *powerful* nap.  It's the Rip Van Winkle type of nap that makes you feel like you just woke out of a coma and you have no idea what time or day it is. 

Next thing Erin and I know, the door opens slowly with a slightly declarative ""DEATH STAR?"" before fully opening.  No knock, nothing.  

As I hear my name, I instantly realize what had just happened: we napped for over 2 hours and my mom's home.  This is summer, which meant that we were fooling around and sleeping ON TOP of the sheets -- no insta-protection.  

The next 2 seconds felt like 2 minutes, Matrix-style.

Erin's first instinct was to put her forearm over her boobs and reach to the *foot* of the bed for her top, which meant that she had to sit up and bend forward *toward* the door and my mom to grab her top (no doubt that she couldn't cover everything with her thin forearm and bigger-than-forearm boobs).  

Recall, my shorts were still around my ankles.  *My* first instinct was to pull up my shorts while on my back.... which meant that I threw my feet up in the air like I just don't care (well, I did care).... and it was like I was doing a neck/shoulder stand with my elbows supporting me.  This meant that my back and ass faced toward my mom ... and my balls were almost tucked back between my thighs, and I [*monkey-brained*](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=monkey%20brains) my mom.  I MONKEY BRAINED HER.  

And I shot my feet upwards 2-3 times to try to get my shorts on more quickly, which meant that my balls jiggled more and my thighs opened and closed in rhythm, exposed to my mom.  The monkey brain was bad enough, but I also showed her a slightly agape asshole that was no less exposed than the average gone-wild girl too ""shy"" to show her own pucker.  And again, those leg jerks to try to get my shorts on just made my butthole/cheeks open and close accordingly.  It was like my asshole was playing peek-a-boo with my mom.

With that classy display, my mom shut the door as if Jurassic Park raptors were coming after her.  Erin and I were catatonic, in shock.  I honestly can't recall what we said other than ""do you think she saw anything?"" (OF COURSE SHE DID)  Denial was potent and immediate.  It was all a blur after this.  Erin got dressed, I finally got my shorts on like a non r'tard. I opened my door slightly, and I heard my mom downstairs dicing and getting dinner ready.  This gave us the ""OK"" for Erin to slip out.  So she did.

I showered and then waited an hour before coming down.  Here's the thing about many Asian families.  We don't do awkward.  Well, we DO awkward things, but we never talk about awkward things.  It's basically like Fight Club, but for awkward situations.  The first and second rules of awkward situations is YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT AWKWARD SITUATIONS.  Times like this I wish I had one of those ""cool"" parents that I read about on Reddit who makes jokes to break the ice and directly address the awkwardness.  

There was no ice-breaking; the Horn of Joramun could not break the Wall at dinner.   The whole night, it was just curt statements and responses, no eye contact.  My mom was angry, but she couldn't express it via discussion, since discussing it would be breathing life into something that ""never happened"" in my mom's mind.  I was mortified, and while I'm able to talk about awkward things, it would've been selfish to force that upon my mom.  So, the awkwardness just stewed and stewed.   And it's still stewing.  Marinating, really.

We ate dinner, no words, really.  My mom didn't finish her dinner, probably because she can't get the visual tea bag out of her mind, or the image of a ""random"" white girl's boobs spilling over her arm.  Such is life as an Asian family.  Tomorrow, I head to my brother's place up north.  Literally the *only* thing that can remedy this is time, and now my watch begins.  

TL;DR -- My mom walks in on me and my gf sleeping half naked, and she sees boobs along with me upside-down tea-bagging her line of sight, with an element of spread b-hole to bottom it off.  Being Asian, we didn't say a word of it -- or anything -- which let the whole awkwardness marinate even more.

EDIT: TL;DR

**EDIT2:  Thank you for the gold and for all the kind-hearted compliments -- they made my day and were a great birthday gift (bday was 4 days ago).**

2y98qr,non_TBI,"So reading the story about the guy ""fucking the shit"" out of a girl reminded me of this story.

Your typical ""this didnt happened today but a few years ago"" 

So I was  22 and in the Army. I had my share of one night stands and random relationships and so on. So I had met this girl and we dated on and off for a couple months. It wasnt super serious but we had fun and at that time thats all that mattered. We broke up a few weeks before I went on leave (vacation) and hadnt spoke for about a month. As I was coming back we started texting. We werent ready to jump back into dating but decided to be fwb. So talking my entire drive back the subject of anal had come up. I had never done it but was eager to do so. She had done it a few times but she didnt think it was all that great but was willing to do it for me. 

We talked about all the aspects of it, making sure she was cleaned up what I should expect and do and so on. By the time I got back in to town and took a short nap we were ready to hang out. We ended up watching a movie and hanging out. Now I have to explain my barracks. It was 3 separate rooms and a shared kitchen and bathroom. They kept the rooms that werent occupied locked. Thankfully an incident had happened and a guy had kicked his door open and they hadnt been back out to fix it (the guy had moved to another room already) So we decided to use the room bare mattress and all to do the deed. We get down to business and everything is going good and im ready to mount up. So I start going to town and everything is feeling great and she is enjoying it too. I pulled out for a second and I stop...I lock down at my dick and it is COVERED in shit. Its not normal dark brown stuff but it was more of a grey speckled color. I dont say a word but I run to the bathroom. I run to the shower and thrust me dick into the water trying to clean it off without touching it. She is waiting in the bedroom when I come back. As I start explaining it to her she realizes what happened. She glanced down at the mattress and there is grey specks all over the place they trail all the way up her leg and all over the place. 

We formulated a plan to get everything cleaned up and we both shower and she leaves. The story does have a happy ending because I ended up marrying her and weve been together almost 3 years now.


TL;DR Girl pooped on my dick so I put a ring on it.

Edit: holy poop on a stick (or on a dick maybe) batman this blew up! 

Some of the questions I keep seeing:

I was young and stupid she claims she cleaned up multiple times guess she didnt get it all out. 

The gray speckle was the poop. Why was it grey? I have no idea I'm not a poopologist and never cared to research it. She has no health problems, she's having elective surgery at the end of the month and everything says she is fine. 

I think she didnt realize poop was on her. She was probably embarrassed I mean I hauled ass to the bathroom as soon as I saw poop dick.

Edit2: This blew up more than ever! Thank you stranger for the gold! This is the best birthday present a redditor could ask for!"
2rifzf,non_TBI,"This happened in November. I recently found out about this subreddit and felt an urge to share this.

Backstory: I'm a ~40 year old man from Sweden. My parents and I were born in Iran. I work as a professor at a university in southern Sweden. I have a magnificent beard.

After a week in New York City I was on my way back to Sweden from JFK airport. I'd been to a conference for 3 days and doing tourist stuff the other time. This was my first time in NYC and it was amazing!

JFK is a big airport and it took me some time to find my gate. I boarded the plane, found my seat and sat down next to an indian gentleman with a red turban. I closed my eyes and mentally prepared for a long flight back to Europe. After literally 2 seconds I hear a woman shouting ""LOOK ARABS HOPE TO GOD THERE NOT TERRORISTS"". Opened my eyes to see a ~70 year old lady staring at me and the indian with evil eyes. Everyone in the plane was now standing up and looking at us.

I felt more pity then anger towards her as I asked her in a calm way if she thought I had something hidden in my beard. The angry look on her wrinkly face changed to pure fear. ""SECURITY TERRORISTS TERRORISTS TAKE EM DOOOWN THEY HAVE BOOOMBS"" she yelled.

Lets just say the indian gentlemen and I missed our flights and I was searched in ways I didn't think was legal. In hindsight I acually feel more anger then pity towards the wrinkly lady..

**EDIT: Wow this really blew up, even got some gold. OP not delivering beardpic tho. Thing is...I wrote this to prove how easy it is to fool y'all. Wrote it in 10 minutes tops. Don't believe everything you read! I mean, a sikh without a beard? Pff**"
2ir8uo,non_TBI,"I occasionally have weird hallucinations/dreams/sleep walk events. Usually these sleep-events are based on something relevant in my life at the time. For example, when I used to work at Starbucks, a few times I got up in the middle of the night and walked around the bed moving my arms and hands as if I was at the coffee bar making drinks.

My wife is a light sleeper and always wakes up when I start my dream-walks. She used to yell at me to snap out of the dreams but over time, she has grown accustomed to it and basically ignores it now.

Last night, I watched the Tron remake.

And then, I got up in the middle of the night, picked up my iPad air and threw it really hard like a frisbee. Ran after it. Picked it up and threw it at the window in the bedroom. Window didn't break but made a horrific noise. I actually remember hearing this noise in my sleep and thinking that maybe I shouldn't be doing so much Tron stuff. But I still ran over to pick it up again for another throw. Threw it back really hard at the first wall.

At this point my wife was screaming really loud for me to stop. I snapped out of it and went back to bed.

The iPad still works but is badly dented in a couple corners. And I have a couple holes to patch up in the drywall. Wife thinks I need to see a sleep specialist."
2uacbu,non_TBI,"I don't often get to see my grandmother, but this time I made a special effort to drive the 4 hours to my house. My parents couldn't make it and I didn't want to drive all that way alone, so I invited my new girlfriend Jess. Jess is one of those kind, thoughtful people who love talking to old people and all that kind of thing, so I thought it would be nice for my grandma to meet her.

So we get there, and it's full of old people, maybe 7 or 8 of them. My grandma is pleased to see me, and Jess and I are the center of attention for some time. We eat some sandwiches and drink some champagne  and whatnot. Then it hits me, the sudden and overwhelming desire to poop. Occasionally this happens to me, like, maybe once every couple of months, especially if I have been working out a lot earlier in the day. Anyway, I go upstairs to the bathroom, but some old dude is in there.

I wait and I wait. I'm there for about 5 minutes and I'm now having to clench my butt every 10 seconds to stop the poop from coming out. I knock on the door and ask if the person will be much longer. No reply. Oh god, why won't they reply. Are they dead? I can't wait any longer.

My grandma has a weird set up where the toilet and the bath are in separate rooms, but right next to each other. I bolt into the room with the bath, hoping a toilet will appear. It doesn't, but I have an idea. I run downstairs clenching my butt the whole time, sneak past the living room and grab a bunch of the little party serviettes. They're pink, with pictures of party hats and candles on. I have a whole wad of them.

 
I reach the bathroom again, shut the door and bolt it. I positively rip my pants and underwear off. Then I desperately begin lining half of the bathtub with those serviettes. Placing each foot on the side of the bathtub and holding onto the wall for support, I let the poop fall out of my ass. There are a few wet farts, but the poop is quite solid and falls out in two well formed, large logs. They lie neatly on the serviettes and I briefly stop to imagine them with candles in. Chocolate log cakes. I'm suddenly filled with pride looking upon my creations. But, I'm sorry friends, my grandma can't find you here.

I wrap them both up as neatly as possible. Little party parcels of poop. I take one carefully in my hand, he's heavy. I open the bathroom window and look down upon the new extension my grandma had built onto the house. It's like another living room, but almost entirely made of glass, glass roof and walls. I can see that during the time I have spent pooping, the party has moved into that room, I can see there's some kind of special set up, a table with snacks and whatnot, everyone gathering around it. That's how big and clear these windows are, I can see everything.
But, the only way of getting rid of these parcels, is by throwing them out the window. Or at least, that's what my giddy post poop brain is telling me. I decide to launch it at an angle, about 45 degrees out of the window, it should be inconspicuous enough for no one to notice, and land nicely in the neighbor's yard. Hopefully someone will mistake it for cake, or an animal will eat it before anyone notices. That's what I think to myself as I enthusiastically launch it out of the window.


Only, the log is much softer than I thought originally. If you have ever tried to throw an overfull water-balloon too hard and had it explode in your hand before you are able to fully launch it, you will understand what happened next. I threw it too hard, and it was too soft. Part of the log collapsed in my hand. I don't exactly understand the physics, but, the poop broke into 2, one part, the smaller part, launched over the house extension, but not quite into the neighbor's yard. The bigger part, fell directly down onto the glass roof of the extension. I watched in slow motion as it fell, the wind blowing most of the party serviettes away, only one holding on tight to the body of the log. The log hit the glass roof with a small but audible thud.


Holy crap. Everyone looked up. Crap. They kept staring. Crap.

 
I ducked inside the bathroom and closed the window. What do I do now? I put on my pants and look bleakly and the second log sitting in the tub. Its little brown head poking out and looking at me in disappointment and fear. What was going to happen to him. ''Don't worry little buddy, your coming with me, there's nowhere else I can put you''.


I wrap him up tighter, to keep him safe. It's me and him against the world now. There's no way I can see out of this situation, no excuse I can think of. My girlfriend is going to leave me and my grandma is probably in the middle of a cardiac arrest. I grab my last friend in the world and place him carefully in my pocket.
I walked downstairs, like a prisoner about to be hanged, I was thinking of all the things I did wrong that led up to this moment. I was tempted to leave, just walk out and drive home, but what about Jess. I waited in the hall, hoping she would come out, but she didn't, no one did.


I walked into the extension, hoping that no one would really notice. I was wrong. Everything was silent. Some of the old people were still staring up at the poop. I decided against my better judgement to look up and see how ad it was. God it was bad. The glass was seemingly magnifying the poop. It looked even bigger from this angle. I can't lie though, part of me was proud.
And then the most awful thing happened. I laughed. I couldn't stop giggling. I was so nervous, I just laughed. I made eye contact with my grandma who is now standing directly in front of me. Somehow, in that split second, I decided all of this would be so much better if it was a joke. ''It's just a joke'' I blurted out through my high pitched giggles.


She started to cry. Full on sobbing, tears running down her face, she couldn't even speak. I don't know what she was trying to say, but the words wouldn't come, and I, well, I just carried on giggling.
I now knew it was time to leave. Jess was in complete shock. I grabbed her and made for the door. I didn't know what else to do. She didn't say a word. As we left the house, desperate to get away from this place as quickly as possible, I plunged my hand into my pocket to grab my keys.


I plunged my hand into my pocket.


My poo pocket.


The consistency was indescribable. Soft, with hard lumps. Gooey, but almost silky. I immediately pulled my poo covered hand out of my pocket, poo and bits of wet serviette were stuck to my fingers. I shrieked. I stood there, staring at my hand. Jess took one look at me, came closer, as if she didn't quite understand, then she realized what it was. We made eye contact, I don't know why, but in that moment, I thought a smile would make everything  better. It didn't. Without a moment's delay, she turned away and vomited. It was only a little vomit, like orange spit. Maybe a glassful. But still... I made my girlfriend vomit.


She didn't look at me again, she literally ran back into my grandmother's house.


I stood there, knowing I needed to leave now more than ever. I searched for my keys but to no avail. The theory I have now is that they must have fallen out of my pants when I so enthusiastically ripped them off during the crisis.


So, I put my hand back in my pocket in order to hide it and walked down the busy main street for 20 minutes in order to get on a 3 hour train to go home.


I haven't slept since getting home. I haven't heard from my grandmother or girlfriend, and I have no idea how to retrieve my car.
"
3fi84q,non_TBI,"Ahhh, fuck it. Here it goes...


Last year I (27yr old male), had a 7 month tumultuous hell hole of a relationship, with a gorgeous, insane cocaine fiend (27yr old female).


Now in all honesty, although I had been clean for 18 months prior to meeting this sexy fuckwit, I had had a drug career spanning 12 years that would make Charlie Sheen's eyes water.


I've ingested drugs that have altered my optical world into a completely different dimension, akin to a jaded R-rated Disney movie. Snorted powders that have resulted in my penis hiding inside my body, resembling a tiny frightened vagina, and on one binge in particular, mixed two tabs of acid, with powerful horse tranqualiser ketamine, which resulted in me perpetually looking inside my boxer shorts to see if I'd soiled myself, every 45 seconds, for 9 straight hours.


But your hear for shit arent ya? So I'll continue.


I had had no inclination that my SO had a habit of her own for the first 6 weeks of our 'relationship'.


However, on one Friday night, she arrived at my apartment for drinks, and dick-in-mouth related activities, and I could instantly spot something amiss.

She paced back and forwards throughout my pad, demolishing glass after glass of cheap wine, and filling my head full of, at this point, only verbal shit. As someone who had pushed my body above and beyond its chemical limits, I deduced, that cocaine was the culprit.


My only fear at this point was that she had hoovered all of the pretty, white powder to herself, and that I was going to be subjected to hours of unrelenting verbal drivel, sober as a judge. This would be an unbearable evening. So, I come forward and come straight out with it,


'So have you got any coke left?'


She looks perplexed, startled. She can't believe she's been rumbled. With her Oscar winning 'I'm not on high grade Cocaine' performance. Oh Please. The ambient lighting in my apartment is reflecting in my eyes, off her sweaty, glistening forehead. She's clenching and unclenching her fists, the shit she's talking about, oh the shit she's talking about. Quit the game sweetheart, your on drugs, and I fucking want some too.


After explaining how I knew, to her pretty, stupid face, she proceeds to reveal the merchandise. It's good, and there's plenty to get both our hearts racing. We begin snorting the ill gotten gains like a pair of truffle hunting pigs. Fuck yeah, I'm high, let's fuck.


I don't know if you readers have partook in a good rail or two of high grade Cocaine, but if you haven't, allow me to explain.


The first line fired up your snout will instantly release a months worth of constipation, at a speed that makes the speed of light look like snail pace. It truly is the most effective laxative. It's unfathomable.


She has not shat on me yet.


We begin indulging in cocaine fuelled sex and its incredible. The sexual chemistry is immense, every breath of each others is felt, every desire noted. You haven't fucked, until you've fucked in coke.


In my head, I imagine my dirty little coke fiend and i, are like gods and goddesses, picture Brad Pitt and and Angelina Jolie. Proper Hugh Grant romcom shit.


In actual fact, we were two out of breath, sweaty, stinking coke heads, filthily fucking in a shithole apartment, in the arsehole of nowhere. But I digress.


Another thing about decent cocaine, is that it can revert a mans prick into the pitiful size it was as a child. Don't ask me to explain how, ask science.


Were 69ing, and she is trying to make do with what can only be described as a nub of wrinkled skin, attached to two sorry looking balls. She's one lucky girl, I'm a great catch.


I dart my tongue in and out of her sopping hole, then ass. Hole, ass, hole, ass. Asshole. That's where shits made.


I apply fingers.


Fingers in asshole, toungue in pussy.


Fingers out of asshole, enter tongue, enter foreign object.


A nugget of foreign object descends, and HITS MY FRONT TEETH.


My eyes water, my nose points north, my tongue recoils. Drawing her produce, into my fucking mouth!


Now I don't expect you to know what human shit tastes like, and nor should you. Dig deep in your memory, and think of the foulest smelling fart that youve had the displeasure of chewing. Times that by an incomprehensible number. Then times that by ten. Your still nowhere near what it tastes like.


So yeah, I ate some shit. 


Tl;Dr arrange my funeral, bring the wreath, she opened her hole, and shit on my teeth."
27jfgg,non_TBI,"Sigh... this just happened about an hour ago. I just woke up and felt the urge to do my morning wee. I walked into the bathroom and as I did I noticed a rather large house spider lurking next to the toilet. Now, I don't have a *fear* of spiders per se, but once they get to the point that you can hear them thump on the floor when they fall off a surface I start getting a bit panicky.   This particular spider wasn't enormous, but it definitely wasn't small either. So, I sit down, whip out my phone to check if anybody had anything interesting to say on Facebook (no) and felt the sweet release of urination. Ah, bliss.   Now this is the part where everything went horribly wrong. I unrolled some toilet paper and folded it over, ready to wipe when - oops. I dropped it. Thinking fast I snatched It just as it hit the floor (yes the floor is clean) and brought it back up to wipe. Wait. What was that on the paper? Some fluff? A hairball? These are all the thoughts that were going through my head as I brought the paper ever closer to my lady parts when I should have been thinking ""ABORT NOW, FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING"". But no. The paper engaged. Then, as I was wiping I realised what had happened. In the split second it had touched the floor it had landed directly on the spider and it had hitched a ride to its urine soaked death.    I took the paper away and saw the spider sat directly on my vagina. The next part still baffles me now, but in between my scream and jumping off the seat I decided in my wisdom that I also needed to make sure this thing was dead. So I punched it. Yes, I rammed that fucker into my pussy as hard as I could. At this point I'm crying and trying in vain to wipe the spider corpse out of myself but I'm just smooshing it around. So I'm just covered in tears, snot, urine and spider guts and I haven't even had coffee yet. The half hour shower I took still hasn't made me feel clean and I can't even begin to explain to my husband what the hell happened.         Edit:  Thank you very much for the my first gold :) I didn't realise it was my cakeday too! And thank you to everyone for their comments, I feel much better now. Some quick answers to some questions I've been getting.. No the spider didn't go ""inside"" me when I hit it it was a term of phraae, however in the aftermath of wiping I can't be sure where any parts of it have ended up without putting a blowtorch down there which I'm not willing to do. (sorry for my lack of formatting I'm on reddit is fun and it doesn't seem to like page breaks?) "
395u8b,non_TBI,"This one is from back in my kindergarten days...

So there I was, one of the few white kindergarteners in my south side Chicago elementary school. One day, I'm hanging out on the playground when this little black boy runs up to me and asks, ""will you marry me?"" I panicked and kicked him in the shin and ran away. 

Shortly after, I'm sent to the principal (who is also black). She asks me why I kicked the boy, and I began to panic. I was only in America for a short time, and my English was very poor. I quickly thought back to when I didn't want to deal with peanuts, because I did not like them, and I would say I was allergic to them and bam! No more peanuts to be dealt with. Using this logic, I didn't want to deal with this situation, so not knowing what allergic means, I told my black principal that I was allergic to black people. Shocked, she called my mother, who had even poorer English, and my mom confirmed, that yes, indeed I was allergic to black people. After all, what in the world could allergic mean?

Tl;dr: terrible English led to unintentional racism. 

Edit: I see some people are linking me not liking peanuts with not liking black people. The way I wrote this, I can see how that indeed comes off as intentional racism. I meant I didn't like eating peanuts, and I didn't like being in this situation. The way the principal spoke with me made me feel like I was in trouble because she felt that I kicked the kid because he was black, and therefore I said ""I'm allergic to black people."" Most of my friends were black (since it was a predominantly black community), and I continue to have black friends that I love dearly (though I get people can have black friends and still be racist). I honestly did not mean to offend anyone with this, and I'm sorry for those that I did. "
2czids,non_TBI,"I stopped watching porn about a year ago. There were a variety of reasons, but the important part for this fuck up is that I don't watch porn. How do I get myself off, you ask? I write sex stories. I get a story in my head, type it out, and do the deed. 

Here is where this becomes a fuck up. A month ago, I was horny and home alone, so I wrote a story. It wasn't a sexual fantasy that I would want for myself, but it was fun to write. In this story, a guy writes a story about his wife totally dominating him in a variety of obscene ways. Wife finds the story and plays it out for him. You can see where this going. 

I wrote the story, got off, and forgot about it. Flash forward to last night. I get a text from my wife right before I leave work. ""Meet me in the bedroom when you get home."" This is great, I think. We've been in a little sexual slump lately and a good bang is what we both need. 

What do I see when I get home and walk into the bedroom? Wife in leather corset and thigh high stockings with a riding crop and strap on dildo. Short skirt and panties (for me) on the bed. Fuckkkkkkk. The worst part was the look on her face. It was this really hopeful look, like ""I would never do this normally but I'm trying really hard to make you happy."" She read the story and reasonably assumed it was what I wanted.

The selfish part of me wanted to explain the situation and back out, but I thought of how embarrassed she would feel. Therefore, I said ""fuck it, lets go."" Did I get fucked in the ass wearing panties and a skirt? Yes. Was it worth it to make my wife feel good about herself? Absolutely. 

Edit about what I've learned, my wife's reaction, and the story: I've learned a lot in these past few days. First, more guys are into being penetrated than I thought. Second, I would have totally dismissed being submissive a few days ago. After a mostly good experience, I realized that I need to be more open sexually with my wife. More communication about our wants and needs and so forth. I should also work to try new things that she might like. Third, I have discovered that one can contribute generally quality content regularly to his favorite subreddit for years and accumulate roughly 600 link/comment karma and zero Reddit gold. That same individual, who involves himself in a misunderstanding that results in his whipping, cross dressing, and penetration of two of his orifices by both body parts and a plastic phallus, can gain two months of gold and over a thousand upvotes. An interesting phenomenon that I judge neither positively nor negatively, though I thank my wealthy benefactors. 

I told my wife that I had never intended to act out the story and was pretty shocked when I arrived home. The fact that we both enjoyed ourselves made it less a confession and more a casual aside. She responded that she had never expected to actually go through with it  until it was happening. We agreed that we could occasionally incorporate some aspects of our previous evening into foreplay and sex, but it would not become a regular thing. 

Finally, the issue of the story. What my wife found was the first of a five part saga where the narrator's life spirals out of control as a result of writing stories that essentially come true. Part two would be an extension of the first but incorporate aspects of public humiliation. Part three would deal with homosexuality, four with cheating, and five with the resolution. I am pretty glad that I only finished most of part one. If I had the thing finished, or worse partly finished, she probably would have thought I was insane or a complete deviant. I am conflicted between posting what I've finished (part one), actually writing the entire story and posting everything, or posting nothing. I almost see the story like the conclusion of a Stephen King novel. It exists better in your imagination than on paper. Anything I wrote would cheapen what you have envisioned. Thus, I need some time to think it over. 

Edit 2: Thank you to /u/Cyae1 for narrating my adventure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRTBkh8Ej4o&index=38&list=PLl0DkyQa9Aqu_aWjvjzvySIZC8PHUPPO6"
2hbqsg,non_TBI,"So I made [this sex calendar](http://i.imgur.com/th1wVCM.jpg) as a joke for my boyfriend who's in town right now. I put it on the fridge so I can reference it from time to time ... specifically when I want it. 

Fast forward to yesterday, for some reason my power wasn't working correctly, in some rooms it was on, in others it wasn't, so I called my dad over to see if he could figure out what was going on. I completely forgot about the calendar on my fridge and he walked around the apartment checking appliances to see what worked and what didn't. It wasn't until I went to get something to drink from the fridge that I saw it and realized I had to hide it immediately, which I did. I wasn't sure if he had seen it, but he hadn't said anything so I hoped for the best.

Then, in the evening I get a call from my mom. She just wants to talk like always, but then she says my dad said I have very interesting choices of fridge decorations. I didn't know what to say, I just laughed and pretended like I didn't know what she was talking about, but now I have no idea how I'm going to look my parents in the face the next time I see them.

tl;dr I made a calendar that said I want my boyfriend's dick every day and my dad saw it."
361yrw,non_TBI,"So today I got home from work, tired and tense and in need of a shower. I immediately had the brilliant idea to take the edge off my mood with a little help from my brand new $100 vibrator, but I couldn't decide which to do first, the shower or the ""me time"". Another brilliant idea emerged: I could simply do both at the same time, and if it resulted in me lying in the bottom of my tub muttering heated endearments to my shampoo bottle, so be it. 

The vibrator had been advertised as fully submergible so I didn't think there would be any problem with taking it into the shower, even though the cashier at Cirilla's had told me that that particular line of vibrators tended to have an issue with the charging port on the bottom where the seal would wear down after a recharge or two and no longer be waterproof. I ignored this nugget of wisdom in favor of awesome shower bliss and all seemed to be right with the world.

That is, until I actually checked the vibrator after using it. I was still in the shower but even still I could see definite droplets emerging from the charge port seal. Shit, I possibly ruined my new vibrator. I spent so much money on that thing. What could I do? I immediately had my magnum opus of brilliant ideas, which was to immediately try to suck out the water. The charge port wasn't on the business end so I figured it couldn't be that gross.

Cue the taste of blood to remind me it could be that gross because Aunt Flo was in town and apparently had accompanied the water up the charge port. There wasn't much water in the vibrator but I still got a definite taste of uterine lining. Nothing makes you realize your own stupidity like having to trace back the line of thought that made sucking liquid out of a recently used vibrator seem like a good idea. Vibrator still works though, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.

TL;DR: Didn't believe my new expensive vibrator's advertising would lie to me so I ended up sucking period water out of it to try to save it from frying."
2fjx7w,non_TBI,"So I met a girl on tinder and she seemed really nice and pretty, so after a week or so of talking we decided to meet up, before I even met her at the bar I get a text that says you better not be in this for the sex... I didn't even bother answering, I get there and she is 50lbs heavier than in her pictures and later find out they were from 4 years ago... She eventually starts talking about how she isn't happy with her size. I am a bigger guy myself so I told her why don't you do what I do, I go to the gym and diet and I'm down 20lbs so far, she called me an inconsiderate asshole... So then later we started talking about snowboarding and I showed her pictures of my Vermont trip and she saw one of me and my close friend who happens to be a girl, well apparently she didn't like the fact that I had a close platonic friend because all she did was question me about her for an hour, I eventually said I'm sorry I have to go and left her with the bill for my two beers. As I'm on my way home I get a text that said look what you are missing out on, it was a nude picture of herself and two videos of her masturbating and the last text said she would have played with my g spot... It was not a pretty sight and I  just blocked her number... So yes that was my crazy date

2egi4m,non_TBI,"First off; I am sorry for not articulating myself too well, English is not my first language.
Well, when I read all this TIFU posts I find myself thinking: ""Done that"" to a scary amount of the posts, but then it hit me, I havent seen anything like this TIFU before so here it goes.
Just to make things clear: In Norway drinking age is 18. And the sexual age is 16.

To long to read? It's in audio now.
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbT2yhil7U&index=2list=PLl0DkyQa9Aqu_aWjvjzvySIZC8PHUPPO6

This happend about 10 years ago, I was 17 years and the legal drinking age in norway is 18, but I looked older so I snuck in to a bar. I was drinking, having fun and start to talk to this lady. She did not drink so we talked about that for a while while I was getting more and more drunk. I remember that I thought ""she got nice teeth"". Yeah that drunk. Oh.So.Drunk.

Out of the blue she asks me if i wanted to go to her place. I thought ""well I've done worse"" and well we left. She told me she was 28 years old, and I was impressed. I was finally getting an experienced girl. Maby I could learn something new from this chick...

Well we get to her place and she gets undressed, so did I. She goes down on her knees to give BJ, I remember thinking ""how long does it take to get the D in her mouth"",she finally started and wow what a BJ it was, the best I've ever had. Better than any sex I've ever had before.

Well after a period of time I was done and that's where I realised the FU. She looked up at me and smiled and SHE WAS FUCKING TOOTHLESS!!! She had taked out the fake teeth and layed them on the floor under her. I never noticed that because....well... Shitfaced. Enough said. I started screaming like a girl and started walking backwards, I didn't see the shower curtan and fell in her shower while hyperventilating making small squeaky noises. For F sake!!! she looked like a toothless bulldog eating mayonnaise.

Well needless to say, I was scared out of my wits so I ran over my clothes, taking them with me, hiding in the kitchen, trying to get dressed. She came out to the kitchen and she had put her teeth in again, I was still scared as hell so I ran out. She started calling me but I did not answer, but after constant calling for 2 hours I took the call and the weird thing was that she started apologizing to ME!!! I was shocked. On top of it all I needed a place to stay for the night so what the hell. Long story short. I dated her for a year and had a whole year full of fantastic BJ's. 

Oh, and she had a gum-disease, and that is why her teeth fell out.  

And yes I know I was an asshole for reacting like that, but I panicked.


TLDR: got a BJ from a toothless girl, got scared, fell in her shower while trying to escape."
3teyo3,non_TBI,"I have a deal with the company I work for where they pay for my train fair, i.e. I buy a monthly ticket, give it to the secretary and then get reimbursed for it.
So every first of the month I buy the ticket at the ticket machine before getting on the train and for the rest of the month just keept it in the same slot in my wallet.
Unfortunately due to friction during the course of every month the writing on the ticket fades more and more and four weeks in the letters are just barely visible.


I had received multiple complaints from the ticket inspectors (understandably, I basically showed them a white piece of paper at the end of the month).
Once I had almost been thrown off the train.

After about half a year of this I have an idea, friction won't be able to harm something that is laminated, right?
The tickets are small enough to fit into the standard business card size lamination pouches of which my company has plenty lying around, perfect!

So feeling pretty good for having this genius idea I set everything up and wait for my little problem to disappear as the pouch with the ticket gets slowly pulled into the machine.

About 20 second later I see the ticket appearing on the other side, but wait, why is there just a laminated black bar coming out and where the hell is my ticket?

Then it hits me, thermal paper!!
(For those of you who don't know, thermal paper blackens when heated so you don't need printer ink/toner, used for tickets and such)

The thing about lamination machines is, you can't just stop them, you can't just rip the whole thing out; no, I had about a minute of watching the true ingeniousness of my idea unfold.

So I take the damn thing, go to customer service to try to explain the situation, but after the first sentence she turns her head and says to her colleague 'Great, another one!' Apparently two weeks earlier someone had the same idea as me!

I get a replacement ticket with an hand-written note stapled to my black bar for the rest of the month and head home to my family.

At the dinner table I struggle whether to tell this embarassing but also quite funny story. In the end I decide to tell them.

And here it comes: when I was finished with my story and expected to be made fun of, my dad says 'Funny, the same thing happened to me two weeks ago!'


TL;DR tried to laminate a train ticket that was printed on thermal paper, ended up with a black bar; turns out my dad had the same idea two weeks prior

EDIT: added explanation of the concept of thermal paper

UPDATE/COMMENT/WHATEVER: shoulda coulda woulda. I was so blinded by the sheer brilliance of the idea that at no point did it occur to me to think of alternatives. And the country is Austria btw, so yeah we've heard of rfid/nfc but mostly still use hammer and chisel on a stone plate; and yes, a stone plate probably would have sustained the laminating :)

UPDATE/COMMENT/WHATEVER #2: daamn, 1776 upvotes? Thx you guys! And I hate the fact that due to countless tv series and movies this number even means something to me"
2u6ml8,non_TBI,"So...This happened last friday but w/e.

  I have been hanging out with this girl for about a year now, lets call her ""Yuki"" who is by far the most attractive girl I have ever see (gave up being a model in Tokyo to study). So its a standard Friday, I go to the bar and meet up with a bunch of friends. We are all getting drunk and partying hard when ""Yuki"" comes up to me and says that she is very drunk and feeling bad and wants me to take her back to her place. In the taxi she was getting pretty frisky and playful which I can't lie and say I didn't like... BUT when she said she was very drunk was a HUGE understatement.


 So anyways I carry her up stairs, get her into her place and set her on the couch. She said she was thirsty and that she felt like she was going to puke so I went and grabbed her a glass of water and a bucket. I walk into the living area and she is butt naked bent over the  arm of the couch looking back at the doorway to the kitchen.

  This girl is fucking fit. Kendo/tennis/swimming and yoga have left this girl in flawless condition. I almost died of massive blood loss upon entering the room. She looks over her shoulder at me and says ""I want it bad...I have wanted it bad for so long... I NEEEEED IT"" and then pukes horrible fruity cocktails all over her hair and couch.


 I carried her to the bathroom and got her into the shower and after a few minutes so comes out and wraps her arms around me and kisses me the most nasty second hand cocktail ever. I moved back and kissed her forehead and said that we should try this again sometime when she isn't completely wasted. grabbed her some pjs and got her to bed, then let myself out.


 apparently she didn't go to sleep... instead she txted her semi abusive ex. and now they are back together talking about getting married. FUCK MY LIFE.

TLDR: 10/10 girl gets wasted and tries to fuck me hard, I be the gentleman my mother raised and leave.


EDIT:!!!!!!!! My FU is not moving in on the obvious attraction from  the previous year... let shit get all twisted and weird and let an amazing (but damaged) girl slip past.

EDIT#2!!!!!!! Was drunk and wrote this. Probably left out a large portion that left me seeming a tad rapey. lil backstory.... her ex basically told her she is nothing except tits and ass and ruined her career and life with insecurity since high school. she quit her job to try and go to school and get a real job because she hated herself. some Stockholm syndrome type stuff. TIFU BY NOT MANNING UP AND MAKING THE FIRST MOVE MONTHS AGO!!!

FINAL EDIT!!! Drunk (more than) semi rapey/woe is me sounding post aside. If you get a chance travel. teach English on the other side of the world, save up some money doing that then travel around Europe. and basically get lotsa adventures in. someday you will be old and out of chances. Visit Womb club in Shibuya once at bare 
minimum!!!!!!!!!!

**Hangover EDIT: No I don't think not raping a girl needs praise and no not raping her wasn't the FU in this TIFU. The fuck up was the couple months before all of this because I was kinda being a man whore with people not in my group of friends. Which btw is not hard at all as long as you fall somewhere between Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt on the ""have a white dick scale"" and have the confidence to not be a vegi-boy.


She broke it off with him last night. Turd got drunk and started pushing her around and insulting her with shit like ""Thank me for making you quit modelling!! you are too ugly to be one anymore"" and things along those lines.
Don't care if I never get to give her the D, at least she isn't marrying a soul sucker."

2qpcrm,non_TBI,"This happened just umm 20ish minutes ago. 

I was browsing Reddit and happened upon an especially funny thread. Usually nothing I read here makes me laugh, but that one made me break up. I stifled the laughter forcibly with a mix of fake coughing and just keeping my mouth shut. 

Unfortunately this made my face turn red and my co-worker think I'm choking. She proceeded to tackle me (what?) and do some bonecracking huggy thing she thought was Heimlich. This caused quite a commotion and other co-workers came over to see me pushed against the wall, with the female co-worker sitting on me and crushing me while my face is all red and I'm huffing and puffing. 

On the plus side, my face was in her cleavage for a few minutes, I kind of did enjoy that. "

2q8t7a,non_TBI,"This happened a while ago. I was walking through a busy underground train station on my way to a job interview when I saw an old lady struggling to push her trolley into an elevator (a wheel had become jammed in front of the doors). This interview was super important and I had planned ahead by leaving early and giving myself an extra 30 mins in case something went wrong. I figured I had more than enough time to help this lady out.

I tucked my portfolio (with my resume and all my original documents and certifications) under my arm and offered my help. She gladly accepted. However, as I was pushing her trolley into the elevator, I forgot I had tucked my portfolio under my arm. Gravity and the worst kind of luck took their course and my portfolio fell right down the gap between the floor and elevator doors.

""Oh dear, I hope that wasn't anything important"" said the old lady.

I didn't have the heart to tell her what I'd just lost, half an hour before one of the most important job interviews of my life. 

""Don't worry. It was nothing. Have a great day."" I said, forcing a smile and walking away before freaking out like a mad man! 

I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry and frantically started calling the elevator company to see if there was anything I could do. The guy on the other end just laughed at me and said that the best they could do would be to take a look early the next morning, but added that it was quite likely my portfolio would be wrecked and greasy. Additionally, there would also be a hefty service fee involved. Needless to say, 'distraught' was a bit of an understatement. 

After calming down and debating with myself for a few minutes, I decided that I should still go to the job interview seeing as I had already made the trip. Besides, I figured that the worst that could happen is that I'd be turned down. Now slightly behind schedule, I ran and managed to get to the interview just in the nick of time. 

""Hi, nice to meet you. How's your day been?"" The interviewer asked as I shook his hand. I could tell he was feeling a little uncomfortable. I'd just given the clammiest and sweatiest handshake of my life. 

""Y'know, honestly... I've just had one of the worst 30 minutes of my life"" 

Intrigued and a little surprised, he asked me what had happened? I told him my story and he laughed until his face went red. The rest of the interview went surprisingly well after that. 

A few days later, I got a call. The interviewer loved me and despite me not having a portfolio; I GOT THE JOB!

In closing, whilst TIFU, more importantly TIL that even the worst kinds of situations may surprise you in beautiful ways. 



**TL:DR** I helped an old lady and lost my portfolio with all my original certifications down an elevator shaft half an hour before a really important interview. "
2lompm,non_TBI,"This FU happened yesterday night.

So my sister who lives nearby had to go out shopping for a bit and decided to leave her 5 year old daughter with me. I have exams coming up so it's not the best time to babysit, but being the good brother I am, I agree. 

The night is uneventful and it's getting way past her bedtime so I take her upstairs to my room to sleep. A few minutes later, she comes down and tells me ""Sing me a song so I can go to sleep"". I am really swamped with my studies and being the lazy ass I am, I tell her ""I'm really busy right now, but you can just go on my computer, it's right by the bed, and search 'Go to sleep' on Youtube and you'll find a bunch of songs."" [Yes, she knows how to use a computer (kids these days)].

Anyways, a few minutes later, my sister returns. She comes in and I tell her, proud as ever, that I put her to sleep by playing a lullaby on Youtube. So we walk upstairs, and as we near my bedroom we can start hearing a song.. it sounds nothing like a lullaby. Walk in and all we hear is ""... AND GO TO SLEEP BITCH! DIE MOTHERFUCKER DIE, BYE BYE, MOTHERFUCKER, BYE BYE! GO TO SLEEP BITCH! WHY ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?! WHY?! DIE MOTHERFUCKER!""

I don't even know why I said to type ""go to sleep"" and not ""lullaby"" or some shit. I'm retarded. Pretty sure I'm not babysitting her again. "

I guess I should edit this since it's getting a lot of attention.

I was planning to use my electric clippers, but they had been unused for so long they didn't hold a charge, despite being plugged in all night.

I did cut the beard down with scissors after discovering the clippers didn't work. It was originally 3 or 4 inches long before I cut it. But I didn't have time to cut it super well cuz I was late, so I sorta panicked and tried to improvise.

It wasn't a job interview, I was returning to work after being on disability for awhile.  Yes, I still have the job.  And yes, my boss is already well aware I'm a dumbass.  

As to why I waited until the last minute, it's kind of a long story, but I was sort of living out of my car/couch surfing the prior week, then I moved into a new place over the weekend and just finished unpacking the night before.  I'm also very lazy and like to sleep in.

I'm gonna dip out now and let you all enjoy my stupidity. No further questions.

3ttbxz,non_TBI,"So as of right now, I have been in the Detroit Airport since 2PM 11/21. My flight to visit my grandmother for the holiday break is now delayed yet again until about 10:30 AM....hopefully. 

Anyways, so yesterday I was on my merry way to visit my grandmother in Kentucky from my university in Providence, RI. I've been flying ever since I was a baby, so as usual I just went ahead and proceeded my travel plans as I normally do. I expected an hour long layover from my flight from PVD to DTW, and then an hour long flight to Indianapolis from DTW. Now this is where I fucked up. While I was about to board my first plane, the people at the service desk announced that the plane was overbooked and they needed two people to let go of their tickets in exchange for $700 in Delta travel money. As a poor student, I was intrigued by the offer, but alas my grandmother was driving two hours from Evansville, Indiana to meet me at the airport. Due to frugality and guilt, I declined the offer and continued to wait to board the first plane. About twenty minutes later after the first class boarded, the flight agents announced that they upped the amount to $1,000!!! I really wanted to take the offer, but like I said before my grandma was already in route to pick me up. As much as it pained me, I thought of all the badass places I could potentially visit with the $1,000. Again, I declined the offer. 

Fast forward to when I am on the 1st plane ready to fly in the sky like the fucking magic school bus, the pilot announces that we have to go back to the gate because it started to snow. At that moment, I instantly panic as I have checked in my carry-on voluntarilY since it was too big to fit in the compartments provided. I have about $3,000+ borrowed camera equipment from my school and I get nervous that things might break because of the snow. I've read multiple times that camera equipment and electronic in general should not be exposed to extremely cold temperature, let alone snow/water. 

We come back to the gate at about 6PM and I ask if I can have my bags since I am worried about potential damage. They inform me that there is nothing they can do for me since it was put in the giant storage thing under the plane. I continue to freakout in my head, but remain cool and calm when taking to all the of the agents. (i mean i need to act like an adult right). Call grandma, apologize for not being able to land in Indy, and schedule an alternate plane to get me to Evansville. 2nd plane is supposed to leave at 8:30PM, I'm pumped. Get on the plane, the pilot informs us that this plane needs to be ""de-iced"" so we need to chill for a quick minute. Fast forward about 2 hours and it is finally our turn to be de-iced. They de-ice us and the pilot lets us know that during the process the chemicals accidentally damaged some equipment. We have to go back to the gate and they cancel our flight at about 11:00PM. Luckily, Delta is giving out complimentary hotel and food vouchers. Me, being a poor student, jump at the opportunity.  Get my hotel voucher, and head out to catch the shuttle for some much needed rest. I have a small sweater, and it is freezing balls outside. AWESOME....the shuttle ends up super late due to the ice and I end up checking in at the hotel by 1AM. Get to bed by 2AM and then wake up at 6AM to make sure I get back to the airport on time. I get to the airport, check-in, same ol' same ol'. Sit down eagerly for my 9AM flight to visit my grams and they delay me another hour. I'm here in the airport writing this now. I really hope I get to leave today. 

TLDR: had the chance to get $1,000 for free, declined and ended up stranded in Detroit without food or clothing. 20 hours into vacation spent in the airport. SWEET

UPDATE: My flight left at 11:30AM and I am now safe in my grandma's house. The airline lost my bag and it is now in Indianapolis. They said they would be able to ship it to me by 5PM today...hopefully. Thanks for all the awesome response! Yes, I have learned a lot from my experience and now realize all the mistakes I made. Nothing I can do about it now, but learn. Yes, I am a Visual Art student who is doing a thesis in photo from Brown and I take classes at RISD! 

UPDATE TLDR: Home now, lost bag, learned a lot."
3458xz,non_TBI,"So this is not today, but a few years ago in high school.


I had failed my classes (THANKS WORLD OF WARCRAFT, at least i got all classes on max level so it was kinda worth it) and was forced to redo the entire year. The first day of school I didn't know anyone in my new classes and took an empty seat in my economics class. A very attractive girl took the seat next to me (we were grouped in pairs). 


In the following weeks, we hit it off pretty well. But not much happened aside from the chatting. Around november/december she got very close physically, to the point where her leg was always touching mine during class. 


We were both invited to a christmas party of a mutual friend. I had a few drinks and I, somehow, became the center of the party. I had learned how to shuffle (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2KXS5DYho) a few weeks back and danced my ass off. It seems this beautiful mating dance aroused my potential mate significantly. 


I eventually took a break from performing my mating dance and sat on a table. Suddenly she, and a few of her friends stood in front of me. I have no idea why she brought her friends. We talked for a while and then she tried to kiss me. The most logical response was to slap her in the face obviously (fist half closed) which is EXACTLY what i did. I was blessed with good reflexes thanks to my dad, who liked to spar with me when I was just a wee little boy. Threat evaded! What does this girl think... Fucking with me huh?! All she said was ""YOU SHOULDNT DO THIS!! WHY??"" 


It was only after I left for college that I realised that she indeed wanted to fuck with me, but in a different way. I was an average guy who played WoW, skipped classes and smoked pot. And for some reason this girl liked me very much. The thought of her liking me didn't even cross my mind ONCE during ALL THESE MONTHS of her foot-fucking and rubbing me. 

I have plenty of other stories like these if people are interested.






"
27sbaz,non_TBI,"Ok this happened yesterday but didn't think of posting about it here till this morning...

I had a long day at work yesterday and when I got home all I wanted to do was relax so I got a drink and took a nice hot bath. I had my phone with me texting and browsing facebook. I decided to update my status and took a pic of my legs in the bath and posted how nice it was to be home in the bath. One of my friends messages me and said did you know you can see for vag in that pic? So I went and looked and even though I didn't see it on my phone when I took it I had not been low enough and at the bottom of the screen you could clearly see my freshly shaved vagina. I took the pic down but it was up for awhile..so friends family coworkers all had the chance to see it. I don't know who saw it and who didn't before I took it down. 


Update: So yesterday morning I get called into my supervisors office and he is there with HR and they ask me to sit down to discuss something. Basically they said I could do whatever I want in my personal life but I need to keep the company's best interest in mind. In paticular postings in facebook that could reflect poorly in the employees and the company. I was asked to please keep this in mind and I had to sign a form that I understood and that they were not saying what I could post but that I needed to represent the company positively. They never said anything about the photo but obviously that had to be it, I was balling by the time I left and I avoided my supervisor the rest of the day, today I called in sick. I don't want to face anyone. "
3augge,non_TBI,"The FU happened a few hours ago, but the motion has been set couple days ago…  
&nbsp;  

It was a beautiful weekend, the weather was sunny but breezy and I spent it with the pretty lady that I've been dating for the last six months. Moonlight shines in and it was sexy times. Grabbed two condoms and used one first night. Second night rolls around and we talked about how we're both tested clean so... You get the idea.
Now this was a rental place so naturally when we leave we clean the place. I cleaned the kitchen and she cleaned the bedroom. Proud of our cleanliness we left with smiles on our faces.  
&nbsp;  

Fast forward to earlier today, 9am. Time for a meeting with my staff. Everyone gets settled in and I start the agenda. About 5 minutes in I needed my laptop to show performance stats, and without my knowledge my pretty lady had bequeathed me with the unused condom that is wedged between my iPad and laptop. With one swift move, I pulled my laptop out of my backpack and the surprise condom came flying out, landed right smack in the middle of the conference room table.  
&nbsp;  

My jaw drops half way, my mind is blank, and I blinked in slow motion.  
Silence ensues. Then bursts of laughter while my face turned into boiled lobster color.  
One of my minion said ""Boss, you had a good weekend?”  
The other minion quickly added ""maybe he didn't have a good weekend... cuz…""  
&nbsp;  
Aaaaaaand the rest of the meeting was not productive.  
&nbsp;  

Throwaway account... Cuz my minions are all redditors..  
&nbsp;  

Edit - hope you, and my minions, all got a good laugh, I have an excellent team and specifically used the word minion because thats our office humor.  
Everyone on my team has a minion or two on their desk. So many happy meals were eaten that month..   
I have no doubt someone is going to be pranking me by hiding condoms in my office…  or my car.. or crap.. don't give them ideas..  
&nbsp;  
TL;DR - Didn't use condom, end up using it in a group setting. "
2bxpa2,non_TBI,"Unlike most fu's this literally happened this morning. To make things clear I do smoke weed once in a while and have nothing against ADULTS smoking weed. So today the secondary school where I teach were holding a quranic recitation for eid celebrations. As a closeted atheist I had no choice but to volunteer in ""gods work"" as most of the teachers did too. I got info from the class snitch that two students have brought a megafuckton of weed to sell to ""aid"" celebrations. I got them and got the weed. As a drug enforcement agent wanna be i made them burn it all in class with everybody still inside. The coughs of a few students made me realized my collosal fu. I evacuated the class but by then most were mildly high. This being nigeria, nothing is going to come out of this, but i really did fucked up.
Edit: took a while but i've upvoted every single comment on this thread both positive and negative (except deragatory comments, fuck those guys). Long live karma!"
3juksl,non_TBI,"Okay so this happened around 3 months ago.  Keep in mind I'm a guy who likes role-playing and tends to make a lot of puns. So I had been dating this girl for about a month and a bit and things were going really great. 

We were alone one day and we were spooning (I was the big spoon) and I had my hands resting around her waist under her shirt. Eventually she gets an idea and says 'Hey wanna touch my boobs?' And being the horny teenager I am, I'm like 'hell yeah I do!' And thus began the moment I began to fuck up. 

Okay maybe it was because I was a bit nervous but for some reason as I started working my way up to her boobs I began to commentate (in David Attenborough's voice) like I was some explorer on an adventure to her boobs. 

After crossing the Grand Canyon (her belly button) I eventually got to her breasts where I said ' Wow I must have fallen and died in the Grand Canyon because it feels like I'm in heaven'.. I thought it was pretty smooth and I think she thought it was kind of cute. (Looking back she probably didn't it was pretty lame) 

But it didn't last long because I was instantly back into explorer mode. 
'Hmm it looks we've reached uncharted land, I'm going to call it...Boobsville'
And this is where I really started fucking up. 
'Shh I need to watch out for booby traps' I started to giggle a little bit but I kept it together.
'Don't get too close to the natives, they might give you the Boobonic plague.' At this point I was trying so hard not to laugh I was holding back tears. 
Eventually I got to her nipple, where I couldn't help but say 'Wait a second, how the hell did we end up in Nepal' and then proceeded to laugh uncontrollably to the point where I could no longer continue my boob exploration adventure. 

She broke up with me the next day. I'm not sure if it was because of the boob incident but I still don't regret it and I would totally do it all over again.  

TL;DR my girlfriend let me touch her boobs and I fell into a booby trap, got the boobonic plague and went to Nepal before we broke up the next day. 

Edit: Wow I can't believe this post got gold, thank you so much."
34vege,non_TBI,"Just did this. In a waiting room with limited seats and other patrons randomly disbursed. A mom and her son walk in. I have an empty seat on their side of me, so I slide over so they can sit next to eachother. She gives me an odd look and says, ""thank you, but we will sit over here."" So I look at the seat I just offered to her child... it's not a seat... it's a trash can. 

TL;DR I politely offered for a child to be thrown away.


edit: Hey reddit! /u/MarkReadsReddit did a great narration of my FU.  [Check it out!](https://youtu.be/UxaPq9uL0SI)"
2yrct2,non_TBI,"This story actually happened about 6 years ago. My sincerest apologies for the length of this story, as I am verbose and often include too many details. But I think reddit might enjoy this. 

It was a sunny warm Sunday and I had been hunting for the recently released G1 Android phone on Craigslist. After emailing back and forth a few times, we arrived at a great price for not one but 2 phones! So, we arranged to meet at an apartment complex about 30 minutes away. I gathered my cash and drove to the location.

I was stupid and young at the time, and did not comprehend how dangerous the part of town I was heading into was. But, I felt relatively safe upon arrival since it was a pretty well populated apartment complex and there were lots of people around in broad daylight. I was standing on the sidewalk in between the parking lot and the pool area, where a bunch of kids were playing, swimming, shooting each other with water guns, etc. Parents were all around watching. Even so, I had folded up all the money and stuffed it in an almost empty pack of cigarettes. I was wearing jeans, a t shirt, a gray hoodie with two pockets on the front, flip flops, and glasses. I put  the cigarette money pack in my left hoodie pocket and I had a switchblade in my right hand in the other pocket. (Hey, it seemed safe enough, but I was being cautious- or so I thought.)

So, the seller comes out, shes a 20 something girl, and shows me the phone. I have a look, agree to the purchase, and she says she needs to go back up to the apartment to get the other phone and cables. She asks me to come up to the room with her, and I decline (haha! I am so smart!) and respond, ""That's ok, I'll wait here."" She comes back down another time to apologize that its taking so long, and goes back up to get the rest of the stuff. I'm standing around, happy as can be, when she comes back again and starts talking. I can't even remember what she said because this is when shit got real. Like, real real. As in time slowed down and I entered an alternate reality where this was happening to someone else and not me. 

She's blabbing about something and suddenly I feel wetness on the right side of my face. I sort of laugh, thinking one of the many children has got me with their water pistol! Ho ho! Well played, little sir! Then I notice that the area, once full of playing children, was completely empty. Not a soul to be seen. My brow furrows as my synapses fire at previously inexperienced speeds to try and orient myself. I notice that the wetness feels oily. My eyes go back to the girl, and I notice that she has stopped talking. Then she bolts. I look to my right, the direction of the blast, and see a skinny man, crouched very low, scuttle around a parked car. Confusion intensifies. Then I see a shadow to my left. 

I turn just in time to catch a glimpse of a very large man charging at me, who immediately lands a Mayweather magnitude right hook on my left temple. I go down. Hard. My sandals fly off, my glasses are ejected, and my arms go flailing as I hit the rough asphalt of the parking lot. 

It is at this point that I realize that the wetness was mace, or pepper spray, or whatever you want to call it. It drips into my eyes, my mouth, my nose, its all over my hands, and its pretty much all over my face now. The burning begins, the scorching searing pain of Mount Doom tearing at my flesh and mucous membranes. The pain is over whelming. I am trembling with adrenaline, even as I write this, 6 years later. 

No sooner than I stop skidding on the asphalt does my large assailant reappear, now kicking me in the ribs, and punching me mercilessly, left right left right left right. He's screaming, ""GIVE ME THE MONEY! GIVE ME THE MONEY BITCH."" I yelp like a little girl, desperate for any intervention or even acknowledgement of what is happening. I remember my mother always telling me that in her rape defense courses they taught her to yell ""FIRE"" and not ""RAPE"" as people are more likely to come to your aid. So, naturally, I yelled everything. 

""FIRE! RAPE! HELP! STOP! NO! FIRE AGAIN!"" but it was in vain. I am no greedy person, and my life was not worth whatever money I had brought, and so I quickly decide to offer it up. But when I reached into the pocket to get the cigarette pack with the money in it, I found nothing but lint. Struggling to squint through the searing pain, my eyes darted around, but I couldn't find it, as I was doubly blind without my glasses. ""I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY!"" I began to yell, between the blows. But he was not having it. ""I KNOW YOU HAVE MONEY,"" he retorted. And so I desperately rolled over and said, ""TAKE MY WALLET I DONT HAVE IT JUST TAKE IT."" 

And take it he did. He rifled through my left jeans pocket and took my shitty flip phone, and then grabbed the back pocket of my jeans, which contained my wallet, and ripped the entire pocket off my jeans. This ripped a huge flap out of the jeans, almost all the way down the leg, exposing my nearly bare ass as I curled into the fetal position on the ground. But the blows did not cease. 

Rolled over onto my right side as I was, my right hand found its way into my right hoodie pocket. My hand gripped tight around the switchblade. I didn't even think twice about what I was about to do, and in retrospect it could have ended a lot worse. I rolled back to my left, and as my arm came out from under me I flipped the knife open and began waving and jabbing and tearing the space immediately around me into little ribbons. I was blind, so my eyes were jammed shut, which meant I had no direction in my attack. I resorted to attempting to appear as insane as possible, and began shouting like a mad person. Obscenities, sounds, animal noises, anything. And it worked. 

All I remember hearing was ""oh shit"" and then the hurried footsteps of that asshole running away. I stopped my targetless attack, and drug myself to my hands and knees. I had to get out of there. I found my glasses, cracked and scratched, close by. I struggled to get them on and feebly collected my keys and one flip flop when I looked up and saw it: about a foot under the back of my parked car laid the cigarette case containing the object of the assault. Somehow, the irony of the situation gave me strength, and I collected my money. I stood up and shouted, angry with the world. ""FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU ALL!"" and jumped in the car. I had no phone, and obviously nobody was going to help me, so I got the fuck out of there. 

I drove. A few miles. Nearly blind. As I sat at a stop light, shaking, my mind began to assemble the facts. This was a setup. There were 3 accomplices. I was the victim of a Craigslist scam. Now, I should mention at this point that I am an attorney, and was at the time a law student. My desire for justice is a driving force in my life, and injustice infuriates me beyond my ability to express myself. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, white knuckled, and when the light changed I floored it. 

I screeched into a tiny gas station with two pumps and about 30 square feet of interior space. I bolted inside and surveyed the store. Most of it was a large glass box where the attendant would sit, sheltered from the pieces of shit that passed for people around here. My ass was exposed. I had tears streaming down my face, which was red as a tomato, and I was mad. Really fucking mad. 

A little old asian lady was sitting in the glass box, and we locked eyes. She was using a cordless phone. I locked onto that phone like a fucking fighter jet, and demanded, loudly, ""GIVE ME YOUR PHONE."" She pointed outside and said, ""Use payphone."" I had zero fucks remaining to give, and so I insisted. ""LADY, I AM NOT FUCKING AROUND. THAT PHONE. YOUR PHONE. GIVE IT TO ME."" She stared at me blankly, and slid it through the little window on the counter. I jabbed 911 and began shouting at the phone as soon as I heard a response. Location. Squad car. Name. Mugging. Battery. Now. I hung up. 

Not knowing that milk and oil are the best treatment for pepper spray, I walked to the soda vending machine. I pulled the plastic wrapper from a sleeve of large cups, stuck it in the ice dispenser, and filled the bag. I tossed the phone on the counter, thanked the nice lady for her help, and went outside to wait for the cops. 

As I sat there icing my face, they pulled up. I told them what happened, and they mumbled something into their radios. They calmed me down a bit, then put me in the squad car and drove back to the scene. I collected my missing flip flop and we looked for my phone but didnt see it. Back in the squad car, and they drove me next door to a seedy motel. As we pulled in, I saw the small parking lot filled with cop cars, dogs, and officers everywhere. I got out, and retrieved my last crumpled cigarette from my cigarette-wallet. I asked a homeless man sitting on the curb for a light, and stood there, ass to the wind, smoking my cigarette of victory as the cops paraded my 3 assailants out of a second story room onto the balcony of the motel. 

I walked up the steps, looked them each in the eye, and provided affirmative ID to the officers, with some flair. ""do you recognize this person?"" ""yes. thats the asshole that pepper sprayed me."" ""do you recognize this person?"" ""Yes. thats the piece of shit that beat on me."" "" Do you recognize this person?"" ""Yes. thats the cunt that set me up."" This got a laugh from the cops, as they snickered and led them downstairs. 

They took me to the precinct to finish up the report, document the craigslist post, etc. I borrowed a cell phone and called my mom (i was staying with them over the summer) and lied, telling her I ran into my friend and was hanging out with him but would be home soon. They had freaked out and were calling police stations to file a missing person's report at this point since I wasnt answering my phone. My wallet was returned to me, soggy, in a paper bag, since they had tried to flush it. I added insult to injury when I used the bathroom, thinking I had washed all the pepper spray off my hands. Wrong. My dick began to sting but by this point it was the least of my worries. They took me back to my car, I threw on some shorts I had in there, and went home to fill my family in. They were hysterical, but my dad thanked me for lying to my mom until I was there tell her in person. 

The next day my boss berated me for showing up a few minutes late. I told him the story, showed him my shiner, and he gave me a pass, but I would later reflect on that morning as the first of many instances in which he treated me like crap. I grew to hate him even more than my attackers. In the end, they all went to jail for several years. The last of them just ended their probation this month. In the mean time I finished law school, got engaged, paid off half my student loans, and made something of myself. Fuck those guys. 

edit 3/13 for answers, tldr, and more information:
To AlyceSparks and everyone else scared of Craigslist: Later the next day, I met up with someone else from Craigslist and bought the phone from them, at the same price. My parents were freaking out, and I'll admit I was a little nervous, but I wasn't going to let those assholes affect my life. At all. This is America, fuck them, I was going to buy that phone come hell or high water, and if that guy tried to screw me over too, I'd fuck him right back just like I fucked them. Nowadays, I usually meet people at a well lit gas station downtown. I go to houses and stuff still, but never in that part of town. Never. I know much better.  Not exactly a police station, but there are often cops parked there and lots of camera so its much safer. I have bought and sold hundreds of items on Craigslist without incident, and am a huge proponent of the service. This is by no means an anti-craigslist post. 

and for Nolat: Once the cops had the location of the incident (the apartments) and the time (like... 5 min ago) they figured, I guess, that they either couldn't have or probably hadn't gotten far. So, they searched nearby locations. They radioed a brief description that I gave them to some other officers while we were standing at the gas station, one of whom questioned the attendant at the motel next door. The attendant reportedly remembered checking in 3 people matching the descriptions recently and gave them the room number. Looks like they just jumped a fence and between the motel and apartments. I doubt there was even a room, they just wanted me to turn a less visible corner. Anyways, the cop called in the cavalry, and they surrounded the building. Then they called us over from the gas station, we swung by to get my flip flop, and by the time we got there, well... you read the story. What I can't convey properly was how FAST, once they showed up, they had these guys apprehended. Seriously efficient police work, I was blown away. Oh and there were probably so many cops since this location happened to be very close to the station. FML lol

tl;dr: (Thanks to downbringer) OP goes to buy phone from Craigslist, sale is a setup for a mugging. OP gets maced and beat on, they steal his wallet (but not the money as OP was smart and hid it) and rip his jeans. OP pulls out switch blade and acts like a mad man to scare his assailants off. OP goes to petrol station and calls cops. Assailants go to prison, OP wins at life.

1p7qu3,non_TBI,"This JUST happened--agh I'm so embarrassed!

Ok, so my back has been stiff recently. I work at a desk. After sitting with clients all morning, my back was really hurting, and I needed somewhere to stretch it out. I first tried to do it standing up in the bathroom, but those stretches didn't reach the right muscles, so I knew I needed to lie down to do it. Clients are always coming in and out of my office, so I knew I had to find a place that was out-of-view. I decided to do it underneath this big conference table because no matter where you walk, you can't see underneath it, unless you're bending down.

My break was an hour long, so as soon as it started, I got under the table and stretched. It was awesome; after a few minutes, my muscles finally relaxed, which felt amazing. I still had like 45 minutes left, and no one had bothered me, so I thought ""what the hell,"" and decided to close my eyes [edit] and sleep [/edit] for a bit. 

When my alarm vibrated in my pocket, signaling the end of the hour, I opened my eyes to see a bunch of legs sitting around the table--THERE WAS A CONFERENCE GOING ON!!

I had a client at the top of the hour, so I knew I had to leave, and in my head I'm like *nononononono how am I going to explain this*, but I couldn't wait for them to finish--it was clear that they were in the middle of it and weren't ending anytime soon.

Very slowly, I pushed one of the empty chairs out from the table. Everyone above stopped speaking--I could tell they were looking at the chair, seemingly moving of its own volition. I stood up from the floor to a group of aghast-looking businesspeople, and said ""there was no way to do this without it being awkward, so... my back was really hurting... sorry to interrupt.""

There was dead silence as I walked out of the room.

**TL;DR** Took a nap under a conference table, woke up to a conference going on above me. Was forced to interrupt the conference to go back to work."
2i2utt,non_TBI,"So today, I was playing some Pokemon Y looking for a female Combee to evolve. Great. After killing a few Ralts that I spent an hour the day before to find, I still didn't find a female Combee. Then I found a shiny. The first shiny I've ever seen. Me, being a huge nerd, I decided to take a picture of it *before* I caught it. I grabbed my phone and tried to hold it close. Then I accidentally bumped into the touch screen. Shit. The next thing I knew was that the touch screen turned blurry and the only words I saw was ""You got away safely!""


EDIT: Thanks for the gold! It's just as shiny. :)"
1sjpsn,non_TBI,"I currently work in a It-consultant firm where we use Skype as our main form of communication. 

Today I took my laptop to work, since I wanted to watch some netflix during my break. Instead of using my work computer I used my personal. So after my break, I sit down to do some more work, when my manager asks if I can participate in conference call with my boss and some of the upper management, I tell him that I'm on my personal computer, but can add me by using my name as username.

So a couple of minutes after I get the invite and I accept. So far everything is fine, when suddenly one of the guys from upper management (not the one who invited to the call), says ""Who the fuck is TITLER?"". That's when it hit me, I really fucked up. I forgot that I have that silly displayname and a pretty fucked up [picture](http://imgur.com/4ij4Knk) to accompany it (NSFW).

So now my boss is kinda pissed, and HR possibly wants to talk with me soonish.

TL;DR: My boss doesn't like tits with mustaches.

2vrlm0,non_TBI,"[Narration by /u/Cyae1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhcrjtzW0Ps)

My fiancé, a guy, and I, a girl, wanted to go see Fifty Shades of Grey on Valentine's Day with another couple, good friends of ours who told us a few days ago that they might want to go see it with us.  Anyway, this morning I texted the girl, who is listed in my phone as Ashley R., ""Do you want to go see Fifty Shades of Grey on Valentine's Day?"" in order to figure out our plans.  The response: ""I'm going to [city across the state] to visit my mom for her birthday.""  ...Ashley's mom's birthday is not this weekend.  

I looked at the contact name I had texted--Adam R.--and realized that I had just asked my boss to go with me to see Fifty Shades of Grey on Valentine's Day.

Edit: Update--As soon as I realized what had happened, I ran over to my boss's office (thankfully the office next to mine) and apologized profusely for sending him the text, and even showed him the text conversation between my fiancé and I about asking our friends to the movies.  He just laughed and said no worries.  But still.  I was so fucking embarrassed before I explained the situation, and still am quite a bit.

Edit 2: Clarification.

Edit 3: Fiancé.

Edit 4: A lot of you guys are being really negative with your comments.  All I wanted to do was share a funny story with you.  I'm sorry for misspelling ""fiancé"" and wanting to see the movie."
3zxua8,non_TBI,"So... My husband is in the Army and went on tour in the middle east. He returned earlier this morning and everyone of the soldiers were in their ACU's when they came out of the terminal.



I was in such a hazy state of excitement and extremely ""in the mood"" that I hadnt even noticed him as he came through the terminal. He is twenty six and has changed a but since the last time I saw him. I saw a younger man approaching my direction and waving with a smile in his face. He kinda looked like my husband, so I started towards him. 



I was about five feet from the soldier (not thinking to look at the name patch) before a little boy went flying past me and jumping into the man's arms. I felt a sudden wave of fear come over me as multiple thoughts went through my head.



Was my husband coming home to a different family? Did he die or go MIA without my knowledge? Where the fuck is he?



I must have looked scarred shitless because I heard him laughing from my left. I turned to see him standing there keeled over in agonizing laughter and I couldn't help but laugh through the tears. I punched him in the chest for laughing at me, but hugged him like I would never let go.



On our way back home he turned to me and said, ""if you would have jumped into that man's arms I would have died laughing. Maybe the kid was a sign?"" my husband will never let me live this down...



TL;DR thought another soldier was my husband, saved from embarassment by a kid



Edit: controversial stuff making butthurt noises



Edit from husband: my wife made errors in this post and in the comment thread. Ignore them. I'm only a Sergeant (E-5). I enlisted as an E-1 and attained E-3 before basic. I didn't volunteer to stay, I redeployed with a different unit as infantry (11B) and there were strings pulled to do that prior to me returning home. I was deployed for six months after basic and wanted to get my 6-year active out of the way. I'm still in the NG and am currently **THINKING** about transfering to Army full time. It was more of a practical redeployment since my unit and all surrounding units weren't going to deploy for nearly a year except one that was deploying three weeks after I was due back. I spent three weeks jumping through hoops while others were making calls and pulling strings to get me redeployed. 



As for the security clearance issue, the Army recruiter didn't want to go through the trouble of getting me enlisted so I decided to go NG. That took time, and I waited until I was twenty because I was getting free schooling through the Toyota dealership I worked for.



Sorry for any confusion... I should have told my wife that Reddit was also known as ""The Brutal"" front page of the internet. 



(SFC mistake was likely from my brother being a SFC)



Edit from Husband: 2: the laundry got folded... It was still *hot* so everything is wrinkle free... Almost everything...



Edit butt/thumb print tattoo: I can not believe she mentioned that. That is a horrible story and I could probably post it in a different sub... Maybe of this receives more upvotes though. I don't think you deserve the story behind it... Fuck that was an unintentional pun



Edit: not putting story up I guess. Any suggestions as to a subreddit it would for in to?"
3gwv09,non_TBI,"Kids are sponges. Our little angel has been eagerly soaking up all the naughty words we say and happily shouting them back at us. Not only does he love saying ""Shit!"" but if we ever say ""shit"" he'll follow up with a hearty ""Fuck!""

So we have a brainstorm -- we would use a different word. Something innocuous. Innocent. We go with ""Pudding!"" After a few tries at this he gets it, but now whenever we say ""Pudding!"" he responds by shouting ""Fuck!"" Not exactly what we were going for, but at least we tried, right?

But that wasn't the TIFU. This was: today is his 2 year birthday. His preschool allows us to bring in a special treat for the class and then they all sing him ""Happy Birthday."" But given the general freak out about nuts and peanuts, you can't bring in cakes or cupcakes. So I bought some treats. Pudding cups. Turns out the teachers were not amused at his response when they told the class ""Hey everybody! Guess what we have for a birthday treat -- Pudding!"""
2og4ag,non_TBI,"   So this actually started about 9 months ago, but whatever... So I'm in school, but I've got a few years on me. Well after an especially rough month of class my good friend tells me that he has bought my wife and I tickets to go see Glitch Mob. Of course, I'm pumped and start planning how to make it a memorable show. I haven't smoked in a while, and I decide that a lil ganja would be the perfect way to enjoy the concert.
   So the day of the show I roll up a couple fat ones and start drinking so I can have a nice buzz before I smoke. Fast forward, I'm good and gone. I'm partying like I'm in undergrad all over again and loving it. The ride to show involves me smoking about $80 worth of good in an hour and acting like a jackass. The show is awesome and way too loud for this old bastard, but I'm loving it.
   Near the end of Glitch Mob's set, my wife and I bail and head to the car. I pass out for a few. Show ends. Our friends come out and we start heading home. Somewhere along the way I lean out the window and puke, puke files into the rear window and hits my friend. Pretty bad, right? He's like a brother tho, so he brushes it off. Literally. And we make it home.
   This is where I fuck up... So my wife and I have been married for about 5 months at this point and I can still do no wrong somehow (that has since changed). I remember very little of this, but apparently she also had a great time at the show, and I was able to get myself together after the 80mph puke session. Friends have dropped us off, and I've showered and brushed my teeth in some semi-delusional hope of getting laid. Well it works. I'm no Ryan Gosling, but I'm fairly smooth when I'm halfway gone. 
   I wake up the next morning to an amazing breakfast and my wife telling me how much fun she had at the show and how much more she had when we got home. Yeah... Alright... I'm feeling good about not blowing my load in under 20 minutes. Straight up boss status. I didn't even remember putting on a condom. So it's a hollow victory.
   Well it turns out I didn't wear a condom. 9 months later and I'm currently sitting in the hospital with my wife as she prepares to give birth to our first child.

TL;DR TIFU by getting wasted, being too charming and not wearing a rubber; today I become a dad and couldn't be happier about it.

Update 1: Thank you for all the congrats! Sorry for taking so long to update, but my wife and I have been exhausted. She arrived yesterday morning. She's healthy, beautiful and I'm already in love.

We found out about a month after the show when my wife tried to take a sip of wine and got instant heartburn. She sent me to the store for tests right after, and after 3 tests we realized we were never gonna be the same. 

Weed around here is stupid expensive for even shitty stuff. Regardless, it'll probably be legal in all 50 states before i smoke again lol

And despite how crappy her conception story may be, she has two parents who love her and couldn't be happier to have forgetten why they owned condoms.

35h6hk,non_TBI,"Definitely NSFW but it's exactly as the title says...

i was so tired and it'd been a huge day and the bf had been giving off signals all day (which i gracefully ignored because we were busy or others were around) but he'd gone and done a heap of nice things for me throughout the week, so when he started giving signals i thought i'd just give him head, he'd enjoy it, it wouldn't take long and hopefully i'd be asleep in 10 minutes... turns out all of that was true... except i was asleep in about 2... and he wasn't finished...

I woke up the next morning sleeping alone.. and i didn't remember falling asleep during it... but i definitely didn't remember finishing it.

Bf apparently felt so weird about the fact he had to take his sleeping gf off his dick and tuck her into bed that he went and slept on the lounge... I don't offer sleepy sexual favors anymore, and he doesn't ask for them after a certain time...

TLDR: I'm a shit gf"
2hk2ck,non_TBI,"Last December I was stationed in Japan with the Navy, and I rode my bike to work every day, about 4 miles one way. One day while riding home I noticed my brakes were loose. I thought to myself ""boy, that's going to cause an accident one of these days!"" Upon getting home I tightened then up and tested them. They worked great!

The next morning I have to go in early because I have the first watch, so I am grumpy and sleepy. A few minutes into my ride, at the bottom of a hill, I get a phone call. Being grumpy, sleepy, going fast, and having forgotten that my brakes are now responsive, I slam on both brakes. The bike stops, I keep going. I lost my grip on one hand, turning the handlebars 90 degrees, and the handlebars stab into my hips, and I fall to the ground cursing. I miss the call, but they call back right away, so it must be important. It wasn't. The person calling just wanted to tell me I had the first watch.

I get back onto my bike and ride the rest of the way slowly, because it feels like I just got punched in the gut. I get to the ship and go to change into my uniform. When I take my sweat pants off I see that my underpants are red. Which is odd because they were grey when I put them on. I look at myself to see a 3 inch gash over the base of my penis. The handlebars hit so hard it ripped my skin open. 2-4 inches lower would have castrated me.

I put my pants back on and go down to medical. It was a larger ship, so it had a sizeable medical staff. I am a bit freaked out by the time I get there, but being early, people are just getting to work. The first person I find is a half asleep Chief Petty Officer with coffee in his hand. How do I explain what happened?

(Me, shakily) ""Uhh, chief, I got in a bike wreak...uh...and I got cut...""

""...what?""

(I pull my pants down in front, exposing blood soaked boxers) ""I'M CUT BAD CHIEF, I NEED HELP!""

(Cheif blinks twice, wakes up) ""Ok, go lie down and I'll have a look""

Many people proceed to look at my penis, they send me to the base clinic, and the clinic sends me to the hospital in town. Now this is a Japanese hospital, so they send me with a female translator. I explain I had a bike accident and that I am cut down there. She explains to the doctor. Many Japanese people proceed to look at my penis.

I regretfully did not take a picture of the open wound, but I did get a picture of the stitches. [NSFW, obviously.]( http://imgur.com/FX4pvHm)

By the time I got back to the ship everyone knew that I had some sort of dick related accident. I was sitting in my workshop and my friend walks in and unfolds a napkin to reveal a catchup covered breakfast sausage and says ""Here, I picked this up off the road this morning.""

tl;dr: Had a bike accident, almost castrated myself."
2zst8b,non_TBI,"This is my first post on reddit, so be nice..ok?Im a 15 year old guy btw.
This happened a week ago. I was down with a fever and had a huge headache, my mom decide to give me a whole lot of medicine to make me feel better. As my dad was coming back from the US, my mom wanted to go to the beauty parlor and get a haircut and some haircolor done.I wasn't in the mood to tag along with her, as I was still drowsy from the medicine, but she said she would buy me some chocolate if I went with her, and so I did.

This is where the FU starts. My mom went into the ladies section of the parlor, and I waited in the reception,browsing my phone,almost about to fall asleep. After around 30 minutes, the medicine effect starts wearing off and I start having a serious headache. I don't know why I thought going into the ladies section was a good idea,but in order to find my mom I did.

Now I don't remember this part accurately, but I think I saw a door at the end of the room, and my medicinally high mind decided that's where my mom was..I ran and burst through the door...and there was a lady there getting a bikini wax(Thankfully not my mom)..Having never seen something like that in real life, I drop my phone in shock,which cracked its screen. The lady screams and threw something at me that hit my head and somehow,because of how unstable I was, it knocked me out..I woke up too see my mom apologizing for what i had done.  

TL;DR: I went to the parlor,high on meds
           Had a migraine and ran into the wrong room
           Saw some pussy and got hit in the head

2alw13,non_TBI,"Probably 10 years ago, but [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2ak7no/tifu_by_peeing_on_my_cat/) story reminded me of this.

The house that was the party spot during our early 20's had a cat that was always around. For whatever reason, he obsessed with pee streams. We mainly partied outside, so anytime someone had to take a leak, we would just go around the side of the house. Just about anytime anyone took a piss, the cat would come over an sniff your pee, bat at it, just generally be fascinated by it.

It started off as a drunken accident, but someone peed on the cat, and said he didn't even seem to mind. Then it became a regular thing to pee on the cat because apparently he liked it (and we were young, drunk, and dumb). ""I'm going to go water the cat"" became a normal saying.

We didn't think much about it, and this went on for months. We just thought it was some feral neighborhood cat because it was *always* outside. Anyway, we're out one night doing our regular thing, and hear his ~80yo neighbor- ""Oh Mr. Boots (can't remember actual name) how do you always get so wet? Let's get you dried off again.""

All our mouths dropped as we looked at each other while this sank in. This poor old lady has probably been picking up a piss-soaked cat and/or letting it inside the house every time we had a party. As bad as we wanted to feel, we couldn't help but laugh. I don't think anyone could breathe for 10 minutes.

We stopped peeing on the cat after that, and my buddy said he raked her leaves for her the next day, ""just because"" when she asked why. I still feel bad to this day, but can't help a guilty chuckle when I think back on this.

edit: Who knew peeing on a cat would get you gilded. Thanks stranger!"
3up6z6,non_TBI,"Okay so technically this was last night. 

So for some back story: 

I've known him since 2009, in high school. He was the older boy I crushed on, and we were never more than ""just friends"". Fast forward a couple years (I had a kid with another man and became a nurse, he became a firefighter & EMT) 

We've been together for two years now and he has become the perfect boyfriend/stepfather. We live together, and have talked about marriage and another kid with no real plans. Both his family and I have continuously joked about how he would never pop the question and it's generally the subject of conversation whenever we run into someone we haven't seen in a while (""when will you two ever get married"") and he would always have some excuse or reason why he didn't feel he should ask at the moment.

Today (ish) we were coming home from holiday shopping and his phone rang. I answered it, because here it's illegal to talk on the phone while driving and the voice on the other end said: ""Hello this is ******* calling from Rodgers & Holland, we were just calling to tell ******* his ring is ready for pick up.""

Update: 5 days until Christmas and he refuses to acknowledge said incident happened. Not sure if he's so upset it's out of denial, or if he believes that by not talking/thinking about it I'll forget. Prepare for another update in 5 days."
2fftid,non_TBI,"The morning after,  
The sun did rise,  
I looked below,  
To find no surprise.  


Penis in trauma,  
Writhing in pain,  
Dried blood around me,  
Bedsheets now stained.  
  
  
I got up and ready,  
A piss I did need,  
So I went to the loo,  
But continued to bleed.  
  
  
Now I was In agony,  
Help I must seek,  
My injury had stopped me,  
From taking a leak.
  
  
So I left my house,  
To go see the nurse,  
For the next situation,  
I could not rehearse.  


The nurse said to me,   
What is the matter?  
My response was,  
My dick is in tatters.  
  

So I whipped out my dong,  
And showed her my plight,  
Viewing the damage,  
Gave her a fright.  


""How did you do it?"",  
I gave my summation,  
Plowing a chick,  
Without lubrication.  
  
  
So I was silly,  
And wrong to assume,  
That I could have sex,  
With a dry and tight poon.
  
  
The damage was done,  
The outlook looked bleak,  
My penis must heal,  
Until no longer weak.  


No sex for 6 weeks,  
And no masturbation,  
Devastated I was,  
From this information.  
  

So I sit here now,  
Posting my story,
About this one time,  
When my penis got gory.  
  
  
Stay safe everyone,  
Thank you for reading,  
But now I must go,  
My penis is bleeding.

"
2i7jid,non_TBI,"Ever since I was a teenager I have had very intense fantasies about having sex with a giant roach. 

It started in 9th or 10th grade when we read The Metamorphisis by Franz Kafka. As I started to think more and more about the roach creature that the character had become, I started to imagine what it would be like if a woman turned into the roach instead. I found this idea very arousing. I would not be repulsed or frightened of her, as the characters in the story are. I would take care of her. Then my thoughts started to get sexual with the character. 

Eventually I sort of dropped the bit about her having been a human woman first, and I kind of imagined this fictionalized roach species. They are giant roaches, the size of a person, and have complete intelligence. I kind of over time conjured up an ""imaginary friend"" of sorts. She was one of these roaches and her name was Ogtha. I would fantasize about her often. Whenever I masturbated I'd be imagining elaborate scenarios of me and Ogtha making love. 

When I started to have actual sex, I found I could not, uh...perform, if I wasn't thinking of Ogtha. So basically now, anytime I have sex with a woman, I am pretending that she is actually Ogtha. Not just think about Ogtha, I concentrate intently to visualize that I actually am doing Ogtha. I don't want to think about the girl at all. There is only Ogtha. 

Of course this sex can never be as exciting as my fully imaginary sessions with Ogtha, there are things that her multiple appendages and antennae allow for that a human woman can never match. 

So anyways, I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year. 3 or 4 times I have tried to have sex with her and not pretend she is Ogtha, but I just can't do it. So essentially every time we have sex I am imagining she is Ogtha. 

I finally confided this to her the other day, and I was blown away by her reaction. I thought she might take it a bit badly at first but that she'd get used to it. No. I have never seen such a look of disgust before. Outraged is not an understatement. She is not even returning my texts now.

I am afraid she is actually going to break up with me and also that is going to tell people about Ogtha. I don't know how I will face anyone. This is going to sound silly but I also feel guilty about feeling shame, as if Ogtha will be saddened by this, even though I ""know"" she is imaginary. I just don't know what to do at this point.

I'm 34 years old and I teach Grade 10/11 History. School here started last week and obviously the first weekend just finished. I was in last period with my Grade 10 advanced class, and I asked them how their first weekend of the new school year was. No one raised their hand so I randomly chose a boy in the back of the class. ""It was awful"" he replied. I decided to say in a joking voice ""Well anything is better than being at school, right?"" He went silent for a few seconds and said in a low voice, ""Well, my dog passed away on saturday and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, but I guess that's better than school, right?"" The room went dead silent, and I had to leave the room for a few minutes.

1dcuxc,non_TBI,"It's my birthday, so my mum says she is going out to get something for my birthday surprise and will be back in about an hour, so I decide to shower and get ready for my birthday surprise. So I get out of the shower, and I don't have a towel but since I was home alone I walk to the dining room where there is a laundry basket full of clothes and towels, because that's where my mum usually does the ironing. So yeah I skip down stairs naked, singing to Taylor Swift - I knew you were trouble.
So I skip into the dining room, naked, singing. All of a sudden.. ""SURPRISE!"".

I am now in my room on my own crying my eyes out, my crush was there as well, and they all saw me naked.."
20lg4g,non_TBI,"I was out really late last night. I woke up today hungover at about 12pm. I usually need to stay in bed for a while and let my brain heal from the damage I did to it the night before, but I really had to make it to Grandma's by 1PM for Sunday dinner. I just suck it up and roll out of bed, and its off to Grandma's we go.

So I get there and Grandma starts feeding me the meatballs and gravy she's had cooking since probably 5am. Usually I eat the whole plate but this time, being hungover and all, I only got to eat about 2 or 3 before my stomach started feeling a little queezy. I excuse myself from the bathroom to attempt to relieve myself of the pain building inside my intestines.

I remember reading that thread about how humans aren't designed to sit on toilet bowls. The basic idea being, your bowels are crimped until you sit in a crouch position. The poster recommended putting a stool in front of the toilet and using it to elevate your feet while you're pooping. I've been meaning to try it out but haven't had the chance. I don't have a stool or otherwise appropriate tool in my bathroom, either.

I remember the thread saying that this natural position for defication will allow you to poop twice the normal amount and get it all out of your system in one smooth shot. I figure what better time to try it than now, so I can get all those toxins out of my body and hopefully it will make me feel much better. What a stupid idea, but when you're sick and nauseous and you're about to shit your pants you get a little desperate.

Grandma's got this magazine rack next to the hamper. My great uncle built it a long time ago. Everyone in my family has one. He liked to work with wood before he passed away. It looked well built and sturdy so I decided this would be my stool device.

By this time I could feel the hot liquidy pool building up around my anus. I quickly unzip and drop trou. My pants are now around my ankles. (Mistake #1). I position the magazine thingy in front of the commode. I put one foot on it to test its weight capacity. Seems ok, besides this thing was built during WW2 I'm sure it could handle my measly 180lb body (Mistake #2). I put both feet on it and this is where the shit hits the fan. It cracked instantly. My feet were tangled in my jeans and I was going nowhere but down. The last thing I remember before my head hit the sink was ""This is going to be loud.""

I'll never be sure how loud it was because I passed out when my head hit the sink or floor. I was only out for a short time but when I woke up, my grandma, mom, sister, and cousins were crowded around me with the rest of my family watching from the door with looks of horror on their face. I lifted my head up and instinctively felt my face. Bloody eyebrow and the side my head is killing me.

Grandma started yelling in Yiddish something like ""Get away from the boy! Give him some room!""; and covers my ass with a towel. Thats when I remembered I was naked from the waist down. Suddenly the smell of shit hits my nose. There is diarrhea everywhere. I shit all over the place. All over the sink, wall, toilet paper roll, the floor, and my legs. It was the sickest thing I have ever seen.

Anyway, long story short... I cleaned it all up and explained to my family what actually had happened. They think I'm a freak but yeah they probably thought that before today anyways. ""Why can't you shit like a normal man"" my uncle said. I was so embarrassed. I just left. I hate you reddit. I'll never listen to you again."

27fdgu,non_TBI,"I feel like I must preface this by mentioning that I am a girl. That's what people seem to be focusing on most when they find out about it.

My best friend and I met when I was 13 and he was 10. We got along great despite him being what I felt was just a little kid while I thought I was an adult. I am now 20, which makes him 17. Also, he has a hot mom. Like way beyond hot. She got pregnant at 16, and she is now 34.

Anyway, this all started when I went out with some other friends this past weekend. He couldn't come along because he is underage (this is in Canada, so drinking at 18 here, though most places start at 19)

We went to a local bar which, while it was not originally its design, now caters to a mostly gay, and especially lesbian, clientele. I am bisexual, and it's one of my regular hangout spots.

So one beer and a couple doobies into the night, I'm dancing with my friends, and I decide to go to the bar and get another beer. When I get to the bar, I notice my friend's mom is there, so I get a beer, and sit down next to her and chat her up, still oblivious to the fact that my friend's mom is at a lesbian bar.

By the time I finish my second beer, I'm getting tipsy (I can't hold my alcohol) and it finally hits me. This is a lesbian bar, and this woman is here, chatting up (and checking out) other women. I let the alcohol and weed get the better of me and I'm flirting a bit, but trying not to be too obvious. I eventually get her to come dance with us, so I drag her to the dance floor.

We're dancing, keeping up the appearances of a conversation, and she puts her hand on my waist. I felt like my face must have gone completely red, I must have been blushing to bad (thank god it was dark!) but I was having a good time, so I quickly relaxed and got up closer.

Eventually, my high was wearing thin, so I excused myself and went outside with my friends to smoke up. She showed up outside and surprised us by asking to smoke up with us. Yeah, she's a cool mom!

We go back in, now I'm good and buzzed and all kinds of handsy, dancing with her, and without thinking about it, I kiss her. She reciprocates. It gets pretty intense, dancing slowly, making out hardcore.

The night goes on, and we call it a night. We're all walking home, and me and her split off from the others cause we live on the same block. She takes my hand and walks with me, right by my place, all the way to hers.

Amazing sex ensues. I wake up in her bed the next morning. No awkwardness or anything between us, just like it was any other day.

Yesterday night, she calls me up (she has all of her son's friend's phone numbers.) Booty call. She comes to my place, crazy sex ensues again. This morning, my roommate wakes up to find my best friend's mom half naked and disheveled in the living room eating cereal and watching cartoons.

Now he found out and obviously totally hates me. Roommate says my friend has a huge crush on me and everybody knew except me.

**TL;DR**: Met my best friend's mom at a lesbian bar. She took me home and had her way with me. Booty call a few days later. Her son hates me now."
2psumx,non_TBI,"Okay, so my friend, ""Todd"" and his ~~girlfriend~~ wife, ""Tiffany"" are kind of eccentric. Tiffany likes to do that weird European cheek kissing thing. I don't really understand it and it makes me kind of uncomfortable.

I've mentioned to my wife, how it's weird that every time we see Todd & Tiffany she's doing this kissy thing.  My wife jokingly suggests that next time I turn my head and kiss her square on the lips, that would surely make her stop doing it. We both chuckle about it.

Fast forward to last night, where me, my wife and a bunch of friends are at Todd's. Tiffany does the kissy thing when we arrive, of course but otherwise we have a good time and are drinking some. Eventually we're leaving. Todd, Tiffany myself and my wife are at the door saying our goodbyes. Tiffany leans in for a cheek kiss and drunk me decides it would be funny to go ahead and peck her on the lips instead. Because, LOL, that will teach her for always doing that stupid cheek kiss thing.

I move my head with what must have been amazing timing and accuracy and get her square on the mouth.... and then ... I don't know what happened, she was kissed me back. Not quite full-on open mouth, but definitely not a small peck either. I think we were both slightly stupefied by what was happening and didn't pull away for at least a few seconds.

Eye brows were raised. I think someone said ""well goodnight"" and we left without making further eye contact. It was a very quiet ride home...

tl;dr Romantically kissed my buddies wife goodnight, in front of him and my wife. She kissed back.


**EDIT** Obligatory ""well this blew up"". Sorry I've been at work.

**FAQ**

* Todd and Tiffany are recently married, and I sometimes still call her his ""girlfirend"" instead of wife. So sorry.

* My wife was somewhat pissed. Thought I might have a ""thing"" for Tiffany. Said I shouldn't drink so much etc etc. I think she'll get over it.

* I talked to Todd, he said Tiffany is pretty embarrassed, but he doesn't seem to really care and thought it was kind of funny.

**Conclusion:**

On the minus side, it's going to make things awkward for a while. On the plus side I don't think I'm going to be getting cheek kisses in the foreseeable future either.

Moral of the story: I don't recommend making out with other peoples wives in front of your wife. Unless you've got some kind of understanding first.

**Alternate, swingers-friendly ending:**

Tiffany, Todd, myself and my wife are having an ~~orgy~~ hot tub gang bang this weekend."

2e45me,non_TBI,"TIFU>Warning to readers; this story does mention the existence of sex. 

Ok so, this story beings monday night at a bar in Seattle. While at said bar, I see a VERY attractive young woman. Now this girl wasn't your everyday monday night bar drinker. she was beautiful, tall, long dark hair, and that look in her eyes that said ""I'm here because I'm vulnerable..."" I had to stop myself from yelling ""DIBS!"" when I spotted her. Without wasting time I run over and introduce myself. I don't want to brag, but my pick up skills are irresistible to Seattle women. I do my mating dance for a few hours and wouldn't you know it, we're headed to my place. We hop in my truck, get to my apartment and proceed to basically eat each others faces. Success!

After a night of passionate rainbows and bananas, we awake and begin the awkward redressing ritual, but as I said this girl wasn't a normal monday night stand. she confidently stands up revealing her stunning naked body, holds eye contact with me and smiles. remaining naked, she stroll to the bathroom turns on the shower and whispers ""you coming or what"". needless to say I liked her. Again, Success!

By this time Im already late for work, its around 9:30am, so I call in and say Im having car problems (a joke rich with irony, but that will be understood later). Now, I could tell this Rom-Com was taking a strange turn when last nights date, who will from now on be known as ""Crazy"", asks me to leave. Yes, leave my own home... I laughed waiting for the punch line, but it never comes. She stared at me with what at the time seemed like a great whites soulless black eyes. I took the hint and decided to just give her some space, who knows what Crazy is dealing with. I step out of the apartment for about 10min and walk down to 7-11 for some coffee.

When I return the first thing I notice is [my truck](http://imgur.com/1GruVfS) I was speechless... Crazy had taken what looks like a sledge hammer and smashed my windshield, only there was no hammer to be found. As if that wasn't enough she then slashed all [4 tires](http://imgur.com/niglRdv). I stood in wonder for some time and then resized my apartment was most likely destroyed. Took a deep breath and walked to my appartment. I slowly opened my door, closed my eyes and prepared myself for complete devastation. When I finally mustered the courage to open my eyes I could not have been more shocked. Nothing was broken, not only that but nothing was moved. In fact, Crazy had folded the sheets, and shut off the lights.

 I started to suspect that this was an example of chance. That perhaps Crazy had just had a bad day and left while simultaneously a psycho had randomly, or mistakenly destroyed my car. I was really hoping this was the case, because Crazy was still super hot and seemed normal. This was not the case. A neighbor told me herd to crack of the windshield and watched Crazy slit all the tires with a box-cutter. he also had no clue what she used to smash the windshield. I never asked for her phone number, and doubt that ill be seeing her again.

I didn't wright this post to help me search her down and make her pay for the damages. I am paying for the damages myself and I'm also not involving police. After spending a little time in heaven with Crazy, and then spending a little money to cover the sobering damages. I have to say, worth it... So heres to you Crazy, thanks for a wild night and a good story!

TL;DR Met a beautiful women, made sweet sweet love, she ruined my truck. Basically a country song...

NOTE; Sorry for the grammar, I'm at work and had to tell the story while it's still fresh.









"
3c5p5s,non_TBI,"This happened in March. Most genuine apologies for length.

My boyfriend and I occasionally like to go see movies in the theater, but we try not to because the prices are outrageous and we try to only indulge when it's a film we believe is better experienced in a theater. This time, however, we really had nothing better to do and we went to see ""Unfinished Business"" with Vince Vaughn (it looked funny-*ish*).

We sat behind a girl and her boyfriend, they were kind of all over each other, I was thinking that they would keep to themselves when the movie started, so I wasn't all pissed-off yet. The lights go off and the pre-previews start (the ones where they show the little animation that says, ""don't run in the case of an emergency, report suspicious activity, *please turn off your cellphone*""). It's uncanny how quickly this girl whips out her phone and begins social media-fying... she's bored already?

I ignore it the first couple of times, the previews start, she's still on her phone. The movie starts, she's whipping out her phone every couple minutes, then remains on her phone for 10 minutes, puts it away, canoodles with boyfriend... whips out her phone again, goes on Facebook, is texting people, showing her boyfriend, whatever.

So about halfway into the movie, this girl is STILL whipping out her phone every couple minutes, doing the same things, as if the events going on outside this theater are so extremely significant that she cannot stand to wait an hour and a half to get back to it. Why do people like this even pay to see movies then ruin it for others?

So finally I turn to my boyfriend and ask him if I should say something. He says, if she does it again, just politely ask her to turn off her phone. After all, we paid like $22 to see this shitty film so we might as well *try* to enjoy what we've paid for. There were probably 15 other people in this theater and nobody else is on their phone!

I wait until she does it three more times. Then, I politely tap her on the shoulder and whisper, ""Hey, do you think you could turn off your phone please, the screen is really bri—""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP BITCH! FUCK YOU!"" She starts belligerently screaming at me, as if she's indefinitely lost her cool. Taken aback I say, ""Woah, calm down! What is wrong with you? Just turn off your phone...""

She just keeps yelling, ""FUCK YOU BITCH, I'LL KICK YOUR ASS! SHUT THE FUCK UP! BLAH BLAHBLAHLAHLABAHLAH I CAN DO WUTIWANT."" And then I lost my fucking cool, I start getting defensive, ""No FUCK you, YOU FUCKING BITCH!"" I just lost it. My boyfriend was all, ""WTF?"" Her boyfriend was all, ""WTF?""

My boyfriend says to me, ""She's just an ignorant bitch."" And the girl has the audacity to yell at us, ""CAN Y'ALL SHUT THE FUCK UP OVER THERE? THAT IS SO RUDE."" To which her boyfriend replied, ""Babe just turn off your phone... we're in a movie theater.""

She didn't turn her phone on again. When the movie was over, my boyfriend and I were the first ones out of there, and I hear her behind me, ""Where is that fucking girl I'm gonna kick her ass."" I hid aside a fountain drink machine.

I was so heated, just livid. We haven't been to that movie theater since. It's pretty awful. Movie theaters are generally pretty awful.

**TL;DR. Asked the girl in front of me to get off the phone and she starts screaming at me and when I tried to keep it together, I ultimately stooped to her level and made a huge scene.** "
34pelb,non_TBI,"So this happened earlier today. Enter me, enter sexy blonde girl. After a night of heavy flirting, I finally convinced her to come back to my apartment. I put on some rock to get us both in the mood for some aggressive sex (she had let me know she was into it beforehand) and broke out the condoms. It was going great. Approximately 4 min after foreplay and getting it in,  my little soldier decided he wanted to get some fresh air. My brain didn't register the fact that I wasn't still inside her and decided to start going even harder than I was before. My johnson bent in half and popped. It sounded like the most satisfying knuckle pop. I looked down, and my Willie was black, blue, and bigger than my wrist. I cried and ran out if the room because of the pain. Apparently fractured penises exist. She left very soon after.

Tl;Dr: you can beat your meat, you can choke your chicken, but GOD FORBID you ever break your stake.

Edit 1: HOLY. This got big. Rip inbox!

Edit 2: Figures my gold cherry would be popped after I break my dick. Thanks kind Internet stranger!

Edit 3: sorry for no response for a while, I was in surgery. Apparently this happens more often than you would expect"
3j3c9i,non_TBI,"(I had to remove the word pussy from the title because of the auto mod rules for weekdays) 

Obligatory didn't happen today bit, goes here. 

So it's New Years Eve 2010 and all of our friends and their kids are over at my house to celebrate.... Except Josh. Josh is home sick with the flu. 

His wife and kids are here. All the kids are inside playing video games and watching cartoons, while most of the adults are in the garage jamming out and drinking and smoking and the usual party stuff. 

Around 11pm or so, the party is full swing, and Josh calls his wife to ask her to come home early because he was feeling so awful. We are all ragging on him in the background and she is complaining as well, since she doesn't want to go home early, and basically tells him to call his mother. Right before she hangs up the phone, I get up behind her and scream towards the phone ""You aren't that sick, throw some clothes on and come over, pussy! It's new years eve! WHOOOOO!"" 

Well, the next morning I have to get up for work... I step over all the passed out kids and friends and go on about my day. Then she (Josh's wife) gets a call from his mother saying they are taking him to the hospital. So she goes to meet them up there, and the walk him into the ER. 

A few hours later I get the call... He has slipped into a coma. 

Josh died the next day.

He literally walked into the hospital and was dead in less than 36 hours later. 

For those that may ask, final diagnosis was a staph infection in his lungs, and yes, he had been to a regular doctor multiple times the previous week or so, and was told he had the flu. 



Those words were the last time he heard my voice... My final words to one of best friends was an insult. 

Last week he would have been 35. 

I miss ya bro. 

I know it was all in jest, and I know that he knew that as well, as we talked like that to each other all the time... But it still sucks to think that he was reaching out for help... He knew it was bad and getting worse , and we just brushed it off as him being overly dramatic. I mean he was the most in shape and healthiest person out of the group, we had no reason to think it was anything other than the flu. 

I don't really know how to end this. I guess just try to remember to end every conversation on a good note, since you never know if those may be your last words to that person.



TL;DR (by auto mod request) called my best friend a pussy, he died 2 days later...  That was the last time he heard my voice"
2b2sl5,non_TBI,"This happened last week while visiting my Mother with my wife and kids....I had spent all day working in her yard, and was tired, hot, smelly and exhausted.  Our house only has a shower, so I decided it would really be nice to relax in the tub at Moms house.  

There I was, in the water relaxing, not a care in the world.  I glanced at a bucket of toys my Mom puts out for the kids for their bath, and there on top of the bucket was a huge steel marble.  Don't know why, but I got curious about what it would feel like 'back there'.  Without thinking, I grabbed the marble and got busy.  Took a little work to get it in, but after getting it past those resistance muscles, I felt quite the sensation as the marble slid on up inside me.  WOW.  OK, that was fun, now to push it out.  

I pushed.  Nothing.  I pushed again, nothing.  OK, so this was going to take a bit of work too.  I pushed really hard, and yes, I felt it move towards the exit....right up to where those resistance muscles were.  I pushed and pushed until I grew tired, and swoosh, felt the marble go back up deeper inside me.  Getting concerned now.  I push and push again, marble works back up to those pesky resistance muscles, and I hold my breath and grab the sides of the tub and push REALLY REALLY HARD and oh man, the pain, but I just didn't have enough push in me, and had to relax and there goes that damned giant marble back up deep.  

Got a little scared now, things are hurting deep inside me now, thinking of the horror of having to go to the Doctor for this, oh no God no...After several more attempts, I finally go with all I got.  Pushing with everything I have, beginning to grunt, feeling the blood bursting vessels in my face and eyes, pelvis up, pushing, pushing, OH GOD THE PAIN, NO NO NO,  YES YES, FEELING IT GO THROUGH THE MUSCLES OF RESISTANCE, DON'T STOP, OH ALL THAT IS HOLY AND NOT THE PAIN THE PAIN KEEP PUSHING.....AAARRRGGHHHH!!!!

I heard the most hideous unholy non human sound which I still can't believe came out of my mouth from the agony of that marble passing through and out.  WHOOOSH!! KLUNK!!! It came out!  OH MY GOD WHERE ARE THOSE MUSCLES OF RESISTANCE?  There was a feeling of a hose pumping out pudding at a rate a fireman would admire.  OH GOD NO PLEASE ANAL MUSCLES PLEASE CLOSE!!! Water turned brown as I began to pass out, I could not stop it, I was dilated like a woman giving birth.  I spewed everything my innards had to offer out into the bathwater. My whole body was convulsing uncontrollably and then the door flew open with my Mother and my Wife flying in because of all the noise.  Poop still spewing out like Mt. St. Helens, my eyes red from popping blood vessels, body shaking.  They just stared as I felt like a water balloon being deflated right before their eyes.    

tldr.  I can never look at my Mother or Wife in the eyes again. "
3dn38n,non_TBI,"I never thought I would have to post in this subreddit, but alas my time has come.

A few hours ago while I was taking a shower, I noticed I had a half chub out of nowhere. Since the rest of my family was already asleep, I decided that this was an ok time to jerk off. Looking around for something to use as lube, my eyes came across my little brother's Suave Kids 2-in-1 shampoo. I've heard terrible stories about people who tried jerking off with shampoo, but I never heard anything bad about trying it with kids shampoo. Upon closer examination I noticed it said 'Tear Free' on the front. That basically sealed the deal for me. If my eyes will be fine from this, my dick will probably be ok also. 

After applying a large amount ( I like it slick) I started wanking my skin slinkie. The first few seconds were fine. But slowly i noticed it started to get hot down there. This mild tingling then gradually started building until it started to fucking burn. Like, HOOOOLLLYYY SHIITTT, it felt like a volcano was using my dick as a butt plug. 

Stifling my screams, I jump out the shower and look around for some way to relieve myself of this hell. A half full glass of milk sat on the counter in front of me. ""Fuck it"" I said as I stick my dick into the glass with no hesitation. Ahhhhh much better. 

You guys probably think my story ends there, but no... Things get a lot worse.

My dad, a smoker, apparently had one of those cravings and decided it would be a good time to have a puff. When I hear him open his bedroom door, it's too late. I turn around, ass naked with my dick in a glass of milk, to see my dad who mouths the words ""what the fuck"" 

I bolt into my room and lock the door. 

I've been in here for 4 hours now trying to think of some way to explain myself.

Tl;dr: Dad startled me with stuck my dick in a glass of milk because I jerked off with little kids shampoo 

Edit: Oh fuck this blew up... Thanks for the front page boys :]

Update: Just had breakfast with my dad. When I went to get the milk for my cheerios, it wasn't there. I look at my dad and he says "" I think you should stay away from milk for a bit"" 

Edit: A lot of people are saying this is fake because I didn't just wash my dick with water. My logic was that it was like a pepper. If you drink water, it'll make it worse. Which is why I thought milk, a good cure for spiciness and burning, would help with my dick as well

Edit: I can see that people are also confused as to why I had a glass of milk in the shower. Who the fuck does that? I got out of the shower, and looked around. The kitchen is right across from the shower in my house so the milk was just right there. My dad got out of his bedroom ( also on the first floor) and went to the kitchen, which is the only way you can get to the porch.

35jj1x,non_TBI,"I meant it as a joke but her response was ""[sister's name] told you??"" 

Edit: I thought she might be joking but when I got home today the whole family was there and she was visibly upset. 

Update: We're going to the doctor this week to confirm it but if she is pregnant it's definitely mine. No I'm not actually a bigfatvirgin, don't take my username so seriously. The reason it was such a surprise is because she has one of those birth control implants in her arm (it's called 
Implanon for those asking).

Update #2: Just finished finals so I finally have time to update you guys. She was due to have the implant switched out because it's been a few years since she had it done. A lot of people are bashing her and it bothers me so let me clear things up. She told her sister first because she needed advice and her sister is older (29) and has had 2 kids already. She didn't know if she was preggo but has been feeling sick so her and her sister went to take a pee stick test and it came back positive. She has an appointment with her doctor in a few hours so hopefully that will clear up the situation more. Whether she chooses to keep it or not I'll support her, we are only 21 but I graduate with my CS degree on Friday and I've already got a steady job lined up. "
44iuiu,non_TBI,"Well here is the obligatory this fuck up didn't happen today but 4 years earlier.    
    
When in high-school I had a crush. (I will call her N.) N and I were really good friends and we hung out all the time. She was really sweet and beautiful. We would watch movies, stayed over and also even gossiped about others. Over time my feelings grew for her but being the boy I was, I never had the balls to ask her out.    
    
She is a hardcore football fan and so am I (not eggball, the real football). We were watching the final match for the league cup. After 90 minutes full of swearing and screaming our team won. We were so happy that we hugged each other and when she was kissing my cheek I turned my head 90 degrees and kissed her lips. She was shocked and jumped backwards. I was so embarrassed that I left her house without saying a single word. All night I thought how I fucked up our friendship and whatnot.The next day I get a text from her saying if I wanted to watch a movie with her. Young me thinks that this was a bad idea and says no.    
    
Fast forward to last day of high-school. She gave me a USB stick saying it had the photos of us she had ever taken. This is where the fuck up starts. That day I lose the USB stick and later I forget about it completely just to find it hours before I make this post. I plug it in and there is only one text file in which she explains how she had a crush on me during high-school, how she would like to hang out with me more and so on.    
    
So yeah reddit, I fucked up.    
    
TL;DR: I lost the stick my crush gave me to express her feelings.    
    
EDIT: I've messaged her, we laughed it over, I explained her my feelings back then and I learned she is currently single. Yaay mee! Somebody's got a date in two days \^^    
    
EDIT_2: Since everyone is asking I will update this post after the date. Don't worry, wish me luck so I don't return with another TIFU post.    
    
UPDATE: Reddit, our date didn't go really well. 4 years change a lot of things as you may know.HAHAHAH. Got ya! Date was awesome and it went really well.    
   
The Date: I picked her up from her place and went to have a dinner. Then we went to watch the football match of our team (the date was planned like this and I am so lucky that our team had a match today in our city.) After the match we grabbed a drink and then I took her back to her place. Night ended with a good night kiss.    
    
So yeah reddit, I didn't fuck up at all. But I think I have used all my luck till the end of my life so expect more TIFU posts from me :P    
    
Also here is a photo, from before we head into the stadium. (For those who say this post is made up, PM me and I will send you the photo)"

This is a tale so epic it fits [the hero’s journey](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney), so I’ve broken it up into appropriate chapters. Obligatory ""obligatory, this didn't happen today."" Obligatory ""Gold!"" ᴵ'ᵐ ᵃᶜᵗᵘᵃᶫᶫʸ ˢᵒ ᵉˣᶜᶦᵗᵉᵈ! ᵗʰᵃᶰᵏ ʸᵒᵘ ᵗʰʳᵉᵉ ʷᶦˢᵉ ᵐᵃᵍᶦ ᶠᵒʳ ʸᵒᵘʳ ᵍᶦᶠᵗˢ ᵒᶠ ᵍᵒᶫᵈ, ᵍᵒᶫᵈ, ᵃᶰᵈ ᶠʳᵃᶰᵏᶦᶰᵍᵒᶫᵈ! 

**ACT 1 - DEPARTURE**

**0) An Uncomfortable Home**

In February I went to the Secret Garden Festival. A laid back music festival held on a big farm a few hours out from Sydney, Australia. Sometime on the final night of the festival, between karaoke, bush treks, and laying in a room made of pillows, I let the phone slip from my pocket.

**1) Call to Adventure**

At 11PM I notice the phone is missing. This phone, was a well loved iPhone 4, all black, with a broken off-button. Destiny had broken that off-button. I checked everywhere I had been...

**2) Refusal of the call**

Nothing. Well, plenty of things, but nothing that was my iPhone. I decide to get some sleep, and wait until lost property opened at dawn...

**3) Meeting with the mentor**

*[Dun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8lDYrvTILc) [dun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wILFddYxKOM)*
Lost property opens up, and no phone.

Enter hero #1:

A girl I met the night before arrives. We’ll call her ‘**Emma**’ (because that was her name). Emma suggests I look for it using the ‘Find My iPhone’ ap. It’s an ap that allows me to GPS locate, call, message, and erase all the content on my phone if it goes missing. 

“Derr” I think to myself. 

She lends me her phone, but to no avail. You can’t install ‘Find My iPhone’ on an Android. Luckily a savior comes along with an iPhone... that’s out of power... And then lost property receives a box... filled with every phone charger known to man! We charge their phone. I log into ‘Find my iPhone’, and see that my phone is no longer at secret garden...

**4) Crossing the threshold** 

My phone is moving through Narellan, a nearby town. It’s moving slowly through shops... Someone has it, and is shopping. We try calling the phone. Nothing. I set it on lost mode with a message to return it, with a number to call. Nothing. We use find my iPhone to make it play an alarm a number of times. Nothing. They haven’t returned it to lost property. They won’t answer it, despite all the rings and beeps...

It’s been stolen!

My bus back to Sydney drives off without me. Emma agrees to give me a lift to Narellan. We jump into her car. The problem is, her phone can’t run ‘Find My iPhone’. So we will need to borrow an iPhone when we reach Narellan... Vroom vroom!

**ACT 2 - INITIATION**

**5) Road of trials**

I explain on the way: the broken off-button on my iPhone means that if it is stolen, no one can possibly turn it off. It can always be tracked, and we have roughly 10 hours to catch it before it powers down.

> “But how are we going to find an iPhone?” Emma asks

>“Hipster cafes” I answer

We arrive in Narellan and head to the trendiest cafe we can find. iPhones are everywhere. The first family we ask is more than happy to join our iPhone chase.

> “This is like CSI!” exclaims mum

> “What’s CSI?” questions child

> “[WAAHHHHHH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMPAH67f4o)” posits baby

They crowd around the father’s screen as my iPhone’s location pops up... It’s about 10 minutes down the road, moving fast... moving by car. If we drive after it, we have no way to track it. We can’t even guarantee to catch up to it. Emma needs to get to Sydney and the phone might be headed to Newcastle (hours away). We set off the alarm a few more times, we call, no response.

* We can’t chase it.
* Emma doesn’t want to chase it. 
* I have to prepare for a trip to Adelaide tomorrow. I need a phone to run my theatre production down there.

It’s over. I’ll just have to buy a new one. I buy Emma breakfast for helping with the chase, and we talk about how crazy it would be to actually get the phone back.

**6) The Temptation**

Hours later, I’ve unpacked and showered at my city apartment. I charge up my laptop, and start browsing for new phones. None of them are right. I want my iPhone 4. It’s black to match my 5 pairs of identical sunnies, 5 pairs of matching pants, 20 matching black shirts, and 40 pairs of matching socks... 

I decide to check in on my phone. I ping it...  and the GPS tells me It’s sitting in Waverly. That is only 20 minutes drive away! 5 minutes later, still sitting there. 15 minutes later, still sitting there... 

I make a callout on facebook: “My phone’s been stolen. [I’m tracking it by GPS, I’ve found their home.] Does anyone have an iPhone and a car and would like to go head hunting with me today? I can pay in gratitude and blood.”

Our second hero comes to my aid. We’ll call him **Inspector Gadget** (Because that was his name) ((It wasn’t))

Inspector gadget says he’ll be at my apartment in 20 minutes with:
1. a van 
2. a phone with wifi hotspot.

Yesss! Social media starts going a bit crazy:

> “Haley: The hunt is on!”

> “Ben: This is a terrible idea.”

> “Jeremiah: I think Ben is the phone thief.”

I get my camera and [crime fighting outfit together](http://i.imgur.com/MvvvhFH.jpg). Inspector Gadget picks me up, and we’re off to get *[justice](http://i.imgur.com/fbia5CO.jpg)*. I get on Gadget’s hotspot, and track the phone - it’s moved 5 minutes down the road to Bronte Beach cliffs and is sitting there. We call ahead to the nearby Waverton Police, who agree to meet us at the beach’s bus stop.

We get there asap, the phone hasn’t moved. We can’t find a parking spot. We find one. I grab my camera to film. Gadget grabs a parking ticket. Our parking is legal for the next hour. We’re late. We rush to the bus stop, no police, so we rush the the location on the map. It’s a long stretch of road overlooking the ocean with cars parked on either side.

The GPS dot jumps around a bit. There isn’t sufficient wifi nearby to pinpoint the location of the phone, but we get it down to a stretch of 40 cars, and begin walking up the street using ‘Find My iPhone’ to ping the GPS location, and make the phone play a sound.

We listen to each car... Nothing. No sound. No exact location. No police. We’re stuck.

We consider that they might have dramatically thrown the phone off the cliff to hide the evidence. But it seems like too much hassle when they could have handed it into a police station, or dropped it in a bin. I ask Gadget how long we have on the parking... Parking tickets!! 

We inspect the parking tickets. Inspect the times cars arrived. We narrow down the 40 to about 15 plausible cars that arrived around the time I saw the phone arrive. Then we start the equivalent of racially profiling the cars.

> “This one has kids stuff, they weren’t at Secret Garden.”

We get it down to about 10 cars. The dot still hasn’t moved... The phone is in one of these cars. Then it hits me. I get a photo of all the cars’ plates. If a car leaves, and the dot moves, we will know it’s in that car. Then we can check the plates on the photo. Cars leave but no dot movement.

**7) Meeting with the Goddess**

The police arrive and I continue taking photos as cars move off. The officers take down my story. They can’t inspect any cars without sufficient proof that the phone is inside. Without the phone audible, we won’t have sufficient proof until the car moves off. My laptop is low on power. Clouds roll in. The police have to go.

All in all, the cops are great. They look like American cops, but they don’t shoot me multiple times or try to destroy my recording equipment. ‘stralia. [So I shoot them](http://i.imgur.com/420L54X.jpg). We say goodbyes. The rain begins to spit. No dot movement. Gadget and I quickly check the rocks below and ask swimmers: 

> “Excuse me- have you stolen an iPhone?”

No one admits to being guilty. Damn it! I was so sure.

* No dot movement.
* It’s raining.
* My laptop runs out of power.

It’s time to head home... On the way home we stop by the old Waverly location - it’s a parking lot for an apartment complex. Gadget is a genius: he says he’ll pop by later tonight and get photos of all cars. If we find plates that match the beach, then we’ll know which car had the phone!

It rains, it pours, but we have a plan. Gadget drops me home and heads off to his other evening engagements. I charge my laptop. The dot is still at the beach. I update Facebook. Half my friend list has been following along, waiting for an update. 

My thoughts wander... I need a phone before I board my plane to Adelaide tomorrow. I head to the Apple store before it closes. I discuss the merits of 5s vs 5c vs 6s vs new 6s3DSxl.

> “Yes sir. You can buy a new one right now.”

I arrive home empty handed. I ping my iPhone. ITS ON THE MOVE. Oh no, it’s travelling fast, back through Sydney, it’s heading north to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, it’s...! It’s...! It’s stopped, in Woolloomooloo, one of Australia’s most expensive areas to live. There’s plenty of wifi and I have a location of the phone within about 5-10 meters! I google map the exact location and get it down to [5 car spaces](http://i.imgur.com/DTcZpNW.png). All we need is one plate to match, and we have our car!

And it will.

Inspector Gadget is busy. My phone is on 20% power. I make another facebook callout.

Enter hero #3. Not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need, **Batman**. (Because that’s his name) (-that he requested.)

Batman is nearby, and treks over on foot. Social media explodes. Hundreds are playing along at home. Friends of friends of friends are in on it, and one guy has been keeping his entire family updated over dinner. Batman stalks his way up the street taking photos of plates. 

> “I feel like Batman”

He sends the plate pictures through! No matches. Shit. We play the sound. Nothing. Shit. Like a good Luscious Pennyworth, I make a googlesheet of all the licence plates from the beach, alphabetise, and send them through to the bat phone. And then...

WE HAVE A MATCH! 

**8) The Ordeal**

Directly across the road from the other 5 cars, is a car with two surfboards I recognise from the beach. We have our vehicle! Still no sound... But we have something better. On the dash is a [Bronte parking ticket](http://imgur.com/fl4Ycml) with the perfect time stamp, and right beside it is a sticker with a mysterious design and a number.

I post the mysterious sticker onto the facebook comments of my status, and quickly we discover, the design belongs to [REDACTED] club. Australia’s richest, most exclusive and powerful [REDACTED] club. The queue to be a member of [REDACTED] is years, and the number on the sticker? That’s the owner’s [REDACTED] membership number. We could call [REDACTED] and find out which of Australia’s richest people has stolen my iPhone. But they’re not likely to give up that information...

Unless the cops ask? 

I call the Waverly police using my flat mate’s phone. Apparently the story has been making its way around Waverly station. They pass me on to the nearby King’s Cross cops. I explain the situation!

The Kings Cross cops tell me:

* 1) There’s no cops nearby
* 2) Even if they came, they can’t open the car without evidence
* 3) We have the car in two places that the phone has been, but it could be a coincidence
* 4) They don’t want to run the plates, and call the owner because...
* 5) The owner is not going to admit to stealing a phone
* 6) Or let us search their car.

So the police won’t send anyone. And then...

* 7) The facebook status with all my evidence [mysteriously disappears](http://i.imgur.com/CsbQtlF.png). (And months later has never reappeared. Facebook won’t answer me about it.)

Too many updates? Too many comments? Perhaps the [REDACTED] has [REDACTED] in high places and doesn’t like their members being accused of theft? I’m told the Australian minister for [REDACTED] is a part of [REDACTED], and they just passed laws on [REDACTED]. Eh. It’s probably a coincidence.

All the while...

* 8) My iPhone is on 15% power.
* 9) Batman’s phone is on 9%.
* 10) It starts to rain again.
* 11) Batman’s stomach is on 5%.

We had it sorted! And now we’re stuck in the mud. Batman goes to get food. I begin to pack for Adelaide, something I was meant to spend the day doing. Gah. I haven’t even rehearsed my play, and totally neglected advertising my show. I don’t have any documents ready, or food prepped. Or a phone that isn’t my flat mates-

Ring ring! [(Or whatever my flatmate's phone sounds like...)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

The police have run the plates! The police contacted the owner! He’s the father of two girls who had just been to........ the Secret Garden Festival! They get me to file a report. They’ll keep me updated. 

Click. Beep beep beep. Waiting waiting waiting.

I consider cutting my losses and trading my iPhone for one of the surfboards on the roof of their car. Would make for a good bartering tool! -no no, the police are already involved. Could get messy. Maybe I’ll wait outside their–

Ring ring.

Police are sending officers! They’re armed with the plate numbers, and the information about the phone.

* My phone has 12% power remaining. 
* My phone is dropping in and out of contact with my pings.
* Batman can only wait around another two minutes for police.
* Batman’s phone runs out of power. Our dark knight goes dark.
* No word from police.

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.

10% power remaining. I need to choose soon whether to erase all data on my phone to prevent any potential hacks...

My phone shuts down at ~2%. It takes 4% to erase. So if there's no updates by *6%* I will have to remotely erase the phone.

9% power. Waiting.

8% power. Waiting..

7% power. Waiting...

6% power... This is it. We tried.

**9) Apotheosis (from here out it’s iambic pentameter because why not?)**

The ‘erase iPhone’ button glows bright....

I move my mouse toward the light... 

And then... Ring ring.

A call from a hidden number.

––No one hears from me for 60 minutes––


I grab my camera, my flat mate’s phone And justice sunnies and run 10 minutes To meet the next train to King’s Cross station,  Slipping in just before the train doors close. I arrive at Kings Cross station and ask For directions to the police station.

I meet with our final hero, a man, Whom we will be calling **Chief Cop Kirby**. (Because that was his name) (Sort of: rule 5!)

The Chief Cop says he needs one thing from me.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So I ask him: “What do you need Kirby?”

And then shows me a face of regrets.

Kirby quickly digs through all his pockets, 

Pulls out his hands, they’re empty, he’s giddy.

Then Kirby says: “I need about tree fiddy”. 

Well it was about that time I noticed This Chief Cop was about 8 stories tall And a crustacean from the protozoic era– [No no, I am just kidding!](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tree-fiddy)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**10) The Ultimate Boone**

Kirby checks my ID.

It checks out.

*I’m real.*


And then he shows me my phone! 

-and it’s still beaming with the return message onscreen. 

[We do the ol’ good-cop, cy-clops routine](http://i.imgur.com/jSymUSb.jpg).


**ACT 3 - Return**

**11) The Return**

With the number plate, proof the phone and car Were together and the revelation That the occupants had just been at the Secret Garden Festval... they were allowed To search the car and found my missing phone!

‘It’s a family car so anyone could have drove it’ so no theft convictions. Everyone wins. Noone loses... Great! I take my phone home, grinning that my Fuck up could not have turned out any better.

**12) Return with Elixir**

I update Facebook, easing their concern.

They cheer for the prodigal phone’s return.

The next day I am off to Adelaide.

And I think my plans are laid -till- ring ring!


A call. It’s my friend from the ABC,

They want to do an interview with me!

They want me on national radio!

But I can’t make it to the studio... 

“I’m about to get on a flight” I saide...

They say ‘they’ll record me in Adelaide!’

So my one hour flight touches down

And I get a lift to the edge of town.


[The assistant](http://i.imgur.com/KUkAroy.jpg) leads me into the room,

And I hear the disembodied voice boom

Of the host who asks for me to regale– 

And the nation hears of my epic tale!

I wait 10 mins for the host to appear, 

Until the assistant beckons me near.

It turns out the host interviewing me, 

Was actually stationed down in Sydney!

I being was a weirdo by hanging about,

So the assistant was told to come kick me out.

(That’s a bonus TIFU for you!)

**13) Freedom to Live**

Now, months later, my iPhone and I are still together, with a broken button, and living happily ever after. I haven’t a worry of losing it, It hasn’t a worry of losing me. It hasn’t worries: it is just a phone.

**TL;DR**

I met detectives, and we solved the case.

That is the tale, of my epic phone chase."
2wblrk,non_TBI,"It wasn't today, but valentines day I'm out shopping long stem roses for the missus, and my three little girls. I'm aiming for Dad of the year, so I know that each rose needs to be completely unique (heaven forbid sisters get the same rose), which leads me to selecting 4 unique roses. If you are one for style (which I am), the colors were very mismatched and did not work well together, which doesn't matter, since they will be passed out individually. However, as I'm checking out, I gave the appearance of someone trying to get creative (and failing) at making a bouquet. I was very self-conscious of this, and it must have shown, as a sweet old lady came up to me and reassuringly said, ""Those are beautiful, she's going to love them.""

Heaven forbid I allow a stranger to think I have poor taste, and I always love a good opportunity to talk about my daughters, so I replied,

""Well, each rose is for a different girl.""

I expected an ""ah, how sweet"" response, but all I got was a displeased look from her and the cashier who overheard laughing. I left feeling very perplexed, until it hit me, I never specified the girls were my daughters."
2rogqk,non_TBI,"I'm 23 years old, and I admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways. 

Earlier today I was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. During that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, I thought I would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

I checked four candy dispensers; all empty. One last chance. I opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, I find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. Without any thought or inspection, I excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. At the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face...Someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

So there I am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as I spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. I'm certain I looked ridiculous, and I'm still brushing my teeth. Fuck. 

EDIT: Yes, in the grand scheme of things, it was better that this happened to me than to some unfortunate kid. It was an unintentional good deed having bit the bullet. "
2fn7ib,non_TBI,"This happened about 30 minutes ago.

I've been living in Asia for about two years now and during this time I've avoided doing ""number two"" in public restrooms that don't have sit down toilets.

For those of you unfamiliar with the alternative, it's basically a porcelain hole in the ground with a foot enabled flusher. These are very popular here but growing up in America left me without any crouch-poop training.

Well today the inevitable happened. While taking my father in law to the ER and waiting for hours I found myself in a bad situation. Diharrea. I could feel it coming.

You know how you test the waters by pushing just a little bit to see if it feels like an explosion waiting to happen? I pushed just enough to arrive at my anus and I could feel the cannons loading, full blast was approaching.

I walked myself into the bathroom, took a squat and let loose a fierce stream of poo. Unfortunately I missed the hole on the floor entirely, instead coating the wall and flusher with my failure.


TLDR: I chocolate rained all over the flusher.

Edit: and there goes my inbox, thanks for making my day!

Edit2: Thanks for the gold, you're awesome."
3zw64k,non_TBI,"It was a family reunion at this restaurant/pub thing. We're all eating happily and my neice had some chicken nuggets and lemonade. All of the other adults go out to get some air and ask me to sit with my neice for a little bit, she finishes her drink and is still thirsty. 

I went to the bar and ordered some lemonade for her, but I was kinda drunk (but not absoloutley hammered or anything) and I, without thinking order Smirnoff Voda and Lemonade, the barman, obviously assuming the drink was for me, poured it. I took my neice back to the table (it still hadn't clicked that I'd ordered vodka for her) and all the adults came back in. Later, I looked at the receipt and realised I'd ordered Vodka lemonade, not normal lemonade. My niece had drank the whole glass. Anyway, I freaked the fuck out, told everyone, my neice was took the hospital, she was okay and only at the hospital around an hour, but my sister isn't talking to me."
30fj5b,non_TBI,"I usually avoid changing in Gym locker rooms. It's not a body image thing, I just don't usually have any time constraints or motivations that would require anything other than waiting until I got home to shower and change.

Today, though, I got lazy and decided to just change there. I didn't feel like putting a towel down on the car seat, okay? 

So I chose the farthest set of lockers because it was deserted (because the last thing you want to do is have to sidle past a fellow athlete and have jingles be jangled and what not) and I disrobed, showered, and got back to my locker promptly, towel wrapped around my waist.

So as I returned to my locker, a group of 6-8 year olds followed by ONE supervising adult came into my locker nook right behind me, because apparently that is where they had set up shop before their pool trip. The adult received a phone call and wandered over to the sinks, partially out of sight. The kids ripped off their swimsuits in exchange for their birthday suits and started cartwheeling around the U shaped locker nook. I tried to ignore them as I opened my locker and organized my belongings. But I heard them murmuring behind me.

""Heheheh, I can see your wee wee!""
""HA! I can see YOUR wee wee!""
*giggles*
They were being kids, sure, but it was a creepy conversation to be privy to as it is. But it got WEIRD when the turned their attention to me.

""Can ya see the big person's wee wee?""
""I don't know, I don't, I don't think so""

This was making me even more uncomfortable. Then one of them snuck up behind me and RIPPED OFF MY TOWEL. The bugger absconded with my towel and started doing his best Hare Krishna impression. 

But I ignored them because no way was I going to chase children around until I at least had my shorts on. But I couldn't find them. They were buried somewhere in my locker and I cursed my lack of organization in putting them away. They continued murmuring.

""GASP! They look like ... potatoes!""
""BIG Potatoes!""

Forget uncomfortable. It was like 9th grade all over again. I'd have preferred a swirly. Even a chunky dunk. Especially after the last kid spoke up.

""... heheh MASHED POTATOES!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!""

And the smallest one (still buck naked, mind you), got on the bench and charged at me, leaping in the air towards me. Considering he just implied he was gonna do some serious damage to my potatoes, I felt like I had no choice but to catch him and hold him as far away from my potatoes as possible. He started thrashing around like I was playing a game of Sega Human Fishing, and I tried my best to hold him as far from me as possible. The other kids, in various forms of undress, kept giggling, pointing at my kibbles and bits.

It was AWFUL.

This is, of course, when their adult comes back around and finds me butt naked, holding one of his children, the rest of them gathered around me. The one in my hands squirms out of my grasp and runs towards the guy. The guy just mouths a sorry and corrals them together towards the showers. 

I just stood there. Ashamed. Broken. 

I found my boxers rolled up in my work shoes. 


TL;DR - Me and my potatoes are never coming back to the gym again, especially if I can't get a restraining order on children.

EDIT: DANG IT, I'M ON THE FRONT PAGE. I guess I should be thankful. Thank you, ladies ad gents, for making my potatoes famous. Good health to all of you!

2hsbmj,non_TBI,"So, usually I don't answer private phone numbers because 9/10 they're salesmen who are trying to trying to acquire my soul. (I may or may not have accidently signed up for this through a porn app on my phone, that's another fuck up for another day)  But jokingly my friend said to me the other day:
""You should totally answer the next phone call you get with something like, 'yeah I dumped the body'.""
Well, today when I was with a group of my friends and as per usual my phone rang, displaying ""private number"". So for a cheep laugh I decided to pick up and say it. 
""Yeah, I've dumped the body in the forest, don't stress nobody saw me.""
After a moment of silence the voice on the other side spoke.
""Mr Rubix, we're going to need you to stay where you are.""

So for the last hour I've been explaining to the police how I really didn't dump any body, and about how it was a prank. Needless to say, it's a bad idea to mess with private numbers.

TL;DR - TIFU by answering the phone to a private  number and admitted to committing to a murder I didn't commit as a joke, turned out the private number was a police officer who needed to tell me my wallet had been found. Spent a good portion of my day explaining that I didn't commit any murder.

-Edit - for people saying it didn't happen, it really did. I was writing it on the way home and was totally hyper about the whole thing. But I understand why you wouldn't believe it, it does sound a little bit far fetched.

Anyway, nothing happened. I went down to the police station, told my story, he laughed at me returned my wallet and sent me on my way. "
3823zh,non_TBI,"This didn't happen today, it happened on Friday.

I was in Tech Ed class and my mates and I decided it'd be funny to make a fully functioning vibrating dildo. 

Why not right?

Any way we worked on it over the semester and on Friday we decided it was ready. Being the tech amateurs that we were, the dildo had to be plugged in to work.

We plugged it in but the result was very faint, hardly enough to feel, let alone pleasure a woman. It was a good thing we prodigies installed a little knob that would change the ""intensity"".  However it  didn't quite work as we expected. We assumed that if we made a switch that caused more electricity flow, it would make more intensity. Seems fair right?

Wrong. 

The entire fucking school went black. This is a schools with over 3000 students by the way. We all got suspended, an awkward conversation with our parents, and a spot in the list of legends in our school.

Tdlr: made a dysfunctional dildo and ended up causing a blackout."
32s09v,non_TBI,"[Insert obligatory this happened when I was 16 here.]

&nbsp;

When I was a teenager living with my parents, I got an adorable, furry, teddy bear hamster. I named him Pipi (pronounced pee-pee) after a radioactive hamster from Invader Zim.

&nbsp;

But I was constantly at school, or with friends. I didn't spend nearly enough time at home, and wanted Pipi to have some company. So, I ended up adopting another hamster, a lady hamster, to be his wife. It was a win-win; I would feel better leaving the house, and Pipi would get laid.

&nbsp;


Thus, I purchased Pupu (poo-poo,) Pipi's wife. This is where I fucked up.

&nbsp;


Firstly, Pupu hated Pipi. She tried as hard as she could to distance herself from her hamster husband. But Pipi liked Pupu. A lot. A little too much. Pupu would run around the cage while Pipi chased her, desperately trying to get laid. It soon became way too disturbing to watch, so sometimes after school, I'd put them in my walk-in closet so that they had some disgusting, disgusting privacy.

&nbsp;


All things considered, Pipi and Pupu were healthy, happy hamsters. Pipi in particular was very happy.

&nbsp;


A few uneventful months went by when one night, I was sitting in my room with the hamster cage out in the open. I got up from my bed and began to walk out the door when I noticed Pupu lying on the bottom of the cage. Worried, I closely examined her. I held my face up to the cage and peered in.

&nbsp;


Plop! A baby hamster was born. Then another, then another. “Mom!” I cried out happily, so excited that I would get to have baby hamsters.

&nbsp;


A million thoughts raced through my mind. What would I name them? Would any of my friends get to adopt them? What would they look like?


&nbsp;


I ran out into the living room and grabbed my mother, excitedly dragging her back into the room. Heart racing and girly hormones a'tremble, I looked at the five little hamster babies, joy spilling out of my uterus. But then...

&nbsp;


...my heart dropped into the pit of my stomach, falling straight out my butt and onto the floor. What happened was indescribably horrific; that hoebag hamster, Pupu, changed my entire concept of life as I knew it, and her actions would forever alter the way I thought about owning a pet any less intelligent than a house cat.

&nbsp;


Pupu reached over, and without any hesitation, stuffed one of her babies into her mouth. My eyes widened. She bit it right in half, snacking on the hamster's face as unenthusiastically as a fat guy on a couch eats a bag of Cheetos, watchin'  the game.


&nbsp;


Before I burst out into a fit of uncontrollable sobs that would last for minutes, Pupu managed to eat several of her babies while Pipi chilled in the top corner of the cage, probably thinking something like, 'Dumb ho said she was on the pill!'


&nbsp;


Turns out, hamsters eating their young is a really common occurrence. When it happens to a teenage girl's married hamster couple, it's a little more dramatic than it sounds. But that's the truth of it. The mother hamster will eat them either due to shock and fear, or having a lack of resources in her body. Apparently, Pupu was freakin' anemic or some shit, because none of her litter survived.

&nbsp;


After that, I was absolutely scarred. I caught Pipi, once again, trying to mate with Pupu, likely thinking something like, 'Hey, she dumb, but she hawt!' I couldn't take it. So I gave Pupu away and kept my rapist teddy bear hamster, the father to five deceased children, cannibalized by their own mother, ultimately, Pipi's now ex-wife.

&nbsp;


The good news is that Pipi lived out a normal, healthy life. He died of old age. And I will never, ever, EVER have a hamster again.

&nbsp;


Tl;Dr: Got my hamster a wife who was forced into mating, became preggers and savagely devoured her children.

&nbsp;


EDIT: Front page?! So excite! Much happy! Wow! :D
Thank you Redditors for all the support. I really appreciate all the lovely comments about your lulz, and my writing style. Really, like, you have no idea how...how much I...OH GOD IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN ~joy seething from uterus~

&nbsp;

PS. I was a dumb 16 year old at the time (redundant statement.) I am much more pet savvy now and believe research should be done before getting a pet. I also have a kitty who was abused by her former owner, and now she is happy. And no hamsters.

&nbsp;

EDIT 2: Thanks, everyone, for telling me your stories too! There were so many replies I couldn't respond to most of them. But I did go through and read everyone else's traumatic experiences. It seems everyone, including myself, thought we just had some crazy experience which actually turned out to be super common! Nature is daaark, man.  I also appreciate the advice, like getting a bigger cage, or putting some meat next to the mother when she has her babies. Ultimately, I learned that hamsters are solitary, and that a lot of people (like some derpy 16 year old girls) just don't know the best way to house them in order to prevent this stuff from happening.

&nbsp;

So, thanks again! I love having friends, so if you see me on teh subredditz, wave!"
2cjelq,non_TBI,"Well, technically it happened last night, but I’ll continue the story anyways.  
I was out at a bar with some friends drinking fairly heavily. My ex-girlfriend had recently turned 21 and had happened to go the same bar. I was not on bad terms with my ex-girlfriend so as the night progressed and the more drinks had been consumed, we made the mistake of thinking leaving the bar together was a great idea.  
  
Fortunately, I was mindful enough to not drive drunk and excited enough to suggest we go down the local beach, which is only a five minute walk from the bar. When we get there, we decide to set up a spot behind the lifeguard chair so we are not completely visible. We begin the act. Although sex on a beach isn’t all that great, the thought of getting caught is somewhat exciting.  
  
It’s at this point I should inform the readers that her father is a police officer in town, but rarely has night patrol.  
Apparently, this is the one night he has night patrol. About 15 minutes into the deed, I stop because I think someone is on the beach. A minute or two later, we forget the noise and go back at it. This was a mistake. An absurdly bright flashlight is shined on my back and a rough voice tells us to stop and get dressed. As I drunkenly fumble with my clothes and she searches awkwardly for her undergarments, I turn to face the officer. Both the flashlight and head of the officer drop in what I can only assume is shame. Being too embarrassed to take his daughter and myself in for public indecency, he decided to drive us home. This was by far the most awkward car ride I have had. I don’t think I am going to be having much more of a relationship with my ex.  
  
Fun Fact: Parents are not to pleased to see their child being let out of the back of a police car at 2 AM.

) by [Cyae1](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cyae1).

Happened a few days ago.

First date at a bar for drinks, felt a bit nervous so I got there a bit early and took a couple of shots and was half-way done with my beer when she showed up late.

Everything went great, she was funny and more importantly she thought I was funny.

After a few more drinks we're a bit tipsy, it's still early and she wants us to show up to her friend's party a couple of blocks from the bar.

So we're walking and chatting and then we notice a family getting out of a restaurant, and one of their children appears to be blind or visually impared, as he is wearing shades and has a companion dog.

My inebriated brain allows an unfiltered thought to be vocalized, something I read on reddit wondering how blind persons are able to tell if they wipe enough after going to the bathroom...

I know, I'm sorry but bear with me.

She laughs but she appears not to get it. That's when I should've changed subjects but I told her something along the lines of ""*well if he can't look at the toilet paper, how can he tell if he's wiped enough?*""

Her reaction really threw me off-guard: ""*eww what the fuck, what do you mean - do you look at your toilet paper after wiping*?"" with an utter look of disgust on her face.


I told her that I assume most people do, once again how else would they know if they're good to go.


She tells me angrily that she's never heard of such a disgusting thing before and that she assumes most people just know when the job's done, they feel it.

We had stopped walking and she was putting me on the spot, I could see that she was waiting for me to say something and to wipe the look of shock and disgust I had off my face.


That's when I fucked up. My drunken state suggested the only option was to attempt a funny and flirtatious remark in order to get back to the good vibes we had up until now.


So I said with a smile and flirty confidence ""*Don't worry babe I know you're clean, I'm sure if I were to run a sheet of TP inbetween your cheeks there would be no skidmark!*""


She slapped me, called me a creepy disgusting piece of shit pervert and took of.

I don't date often, and was devastated.

At least I laugh about it now - after I told him the story a friend just said ""dirty-ass bitches man""."
3o85zm,non_TBI,"While I understand that sex can be an intensifier to a FU and that it can make things funnier (generally speaking), this subreddit is becoming overrun by constant TIFUs which have to do with sex, porn, or masturbation, and I can't be the only one who thinks this is becoming a bit dry. [This is the second page of my account](http://imgur.com/WmdIyC3)."
36niyh,non_TBI,"Backstory: I'm from the west coast and have moved to the south. There's a lot of things I don't know.

My boyfriend and his friends had a get-together last night and were hanging out, just chatting. I normally let them have their guy time but was in the dining room getting some pizza and just saying hi. They were talking about football: what they'd do if they were a coach, made their own team, etc. I don't know anything about football but just wanted to add in for the fun of it. I thought for a second and came up with a clever idea. My favorite animal is a raccoon and our state animal is a raccoon. I quickly piped in, ""If I had a team, I'd call them The Coons!""

They looked at me for a second, completely shocked. Half the table started laughing hysterically and the other half, especially the black guy, were just giving me the most 'WTF' look. I had no idea what I'd said. Finally they explained it to me and everyone got a good little chuckle out of it and I'm never going to live it down. Needless to say I think I'll just let them have their guy time for now on. "
25gebi,non_TBI,"So, I'm skyping with my ex girlfriend for the first time since we broke up four months ago, we had finally been able to talk about things after awhile. We're both talking about how we miss each other, you know, that teenage shit. I'm on my desktop, with my headphones plugged in, browsing Reddit /r/gifs whilst she continues to tell me about how she missed me. After awhile, we start talking about seeing each other. 


The conversation begins to get more intimate, next thing you know she wants to see me. She's 45 minutes away and it's nearly 12AM, we decide to quickly cam. I turn on my cam and she does too. I minimize Reddit. About forty minutes later, she flashes her tits. I haven't had sex, nor any female physical contact in four months. Instant, rock hard erection to say the least. She notices, and begins begging me to jerk off. Of course I'm going to, she takes off her top, and I flop out my cock. 


I was a bit nervous, my computers right infront the door, if anyone was to walk in, they'd see me jerking it. I kept assuring myself, it's nearly 2AM, everyone's asleep.


I'm close to cumming, edging if anything. I begin to hear my door slowly open (fuck carpet, no footsteps heard).. I quickly hangup and switch the browser to Reddit, back to [this]
(http://i.imgur.com/njv8n.gif). 
I look back, to see my father, his eyes in shock, as if he witnessed his son die before him. As I quickly put my pants back on, I have no fucking idea but my cock decides to climax, cum lands all over the floor, in a matter of seconds. Right in-front of my dad. 


He didn't say anything, but I'm sure he's confused what the fuck I'm doing.. What in the fuck do I do? I think he believes I beat it to priests fighting guys in white tuxedos. 


**TL;DR : Dad caught me jerking off, might believe I beat it to priests fighting guys in white tuxedos.**


edit : I'm glad my misfortune provided some of you with laughs! just to clarify, I don't have a lock! 
Also, forgot to mention : Ex got pissed off"
31uyww,non_TBI,"So this actually happened about 15 minutes ago and it still hurts, man. 
I'll keep this as short as possible. So after finishing work and having dinner I decided to take a shower and get ready for bed. After the shower I decided to just put on a t-shirt and a pair of briefs. No pants required as I would soon be in bed. After returning to the wife who was on the couch watching television I decided I would go outside for a quick cigarette before watching a little tv with the wife. So we have a glass sliding door which leads out to our deck and while I'm outside having a cigarette the wife can see me. I can see her glancing at me about every 30 seconds or so. This is when I decide it would be super funny if the next time she looks at me my nuts are hanging out the side of my briefs. So I wait till she turns away the I get my nuts out. Now I'm standing there smoking a cigarette with my nuts out. Just as she starts to turn to look at me again I was taking a drag on the cigarette. And that's when it happened. For some reason the cigarette got stuck to my lip. As I went to get it off my lip I dropped it and it landed straight on my ball sack. Bad times. The wife thinks it's the funniest thing she has ever seen and I can still here her laughing. Now I'm her running my ball sack under cold water while I type this.

TLDR: dropped a lit cigarette on my balls."
2kb4bj,non_TBI,"My parents had just gotten a new car, and unlike my old car, this one had bluetooth in it. So I'm heading home from a baseball tournament and I've got my phone connected to the bluetooth in the car and we're listening to music. Eventually we get home and I go upstairs to my room for some me-time. My room is on the 3rd floor of my house, facing the street. I'm in my room with porn on my phone having some great fun when all of the sudden the sound stops. The video is playing like normal, but the sound is just gone. Then I hear the sound of a car driving over the drain in my driveway, and I realize. I look outside my window, being careful to not be seen, and see my mom in the car outside, all the windows down, blasting the sound of Madison Ivy getting fucked to the neighborhood as she frantically looks for a way to turn it off (remember, new car.) She gets it eventually and turns it off. She doesn't know I know, and I pretend as if nothing happened.

Edit: Well, people are commenting that the bluetooth range an a cell phone is typically shorter than whatever the distance from the 3rd floor of a house to the street is. I truly don't have an answer to that, but I did ask my dad if his phone has ever connected to the car from the house, and he said he's had the same problem (with a phone call, he said, but i've got my doubts....) anyways idk what to tell ya"

3koucx,non_TBI,"A little backstory, my dad has back problems and i got a new mattress which he loves. 

So i was coming home for work late last night, and decided to go on my computer which is located parallel to my bed. I soon seen a nsfw link on reddit which got me horny and i started masturbating, little did i know my father was sleeping behind me. While i was going off my dad yells ""you do know im here right"" and i started panicking and without saying a word i quickly ran out of the house and off to my friends house.

Now im scared to go back home. i feel as if i should pretend like i never even came home last night if my father brings it up.

TL:DR - Masturbated while my father was in the room, now im scared to go back home.

EDIT: Finally came home an hour ago, my dad actually thought it was funny and decided to tell my whole family the story. This will haunt me for a couple of years at least."
3761ul,non_TBI,"I share a bedroom with my sister, so I almost never get any time to myself for issues that require a bit of privacy. Usually, I do my business in the bathroom and before doing so I announce that I'm going to go 'drop bombs' (yes I say drop bombs when I need to poop). This time, however, was a little different. I was watching a porno on my phone and got that feeling. Encapsulated by what I saw, I wasn't thinking straight. Carelessly, I said out loud ""I'm going to go fap"" instead of ""I'm going to go drop bombs"". Realizing, through the look of ""what the fuck"" I recieved, I became mortified and instantly went into a coughing spasm and kept saying my stomach hurts while running to the toilet (I didn't know what else to do). That's my TIFU story Reddit, go easy on me."
3vj7wl,non_TBI,"This happened in middle school.

I was addicted to chewing gum, I'd always keep several packs in my locker, and I'd go through it like anything.

I ran out of gum a couple days before my mom was getting groceries, so to remind myself to replenish the supply I kept in my locker, I made a note in my school-issued homework planner.

""Bring Gum,"" I wrote, in my sloppy, preteen cursive script.

Later that day, I accidentally left my planner in the cafeteria. I didn't even notice it was gone, being a fairly disorganized kid. 

It was only an hour after lunch when I was escorted to the office, by the principal and the school cop, who I only knew from our ""DARE"" program. I had no idea what I'd done wrong, and when I was sat down at the principal's desk, he pulled the planner out.

""Is this your planner?"" he asked me, and I got even more nervous. It was at that moment I realized I'd left it behind in the cafeteria. I wasn't sure exactly what in the planner I was in trouble for, though I suspected it could have been one of the unflattering doodles I'd drawn of my teachers. Or perhaps the gossipy notes in the back, passed back and forth between my friends and I. 

Not wanting to own up to having drawn Mrs. Ellis with elephant ears and a stumpy tail, or Mr. Bell with pig nostrils and a comically large potbelly, I answered ""I dunno, looks like the one everyone's got."" 

I hadn't put my name in it, and thought I might just be able to get away with feigning ignorance. 

The principal flipped open to the current week of the planner, where I had scrawled ""Bring Gum"" and said ""We know this is yours, from your schedule of classes. Did you write this?""

I was surprised that my little note about gum was the reason for me getting called to the office, since I was sure I was in trouble for my rude caricatures of my teachers!

I owned up to it, saying ""Yeah, I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to have gum..."" 

My principal and the cop looked incredulous, and I said, ""Look, I'm sorry, I won't keep chewing gum in class!"" 

""That's an 'N', my principal said, pointing to my scrawled cursive. And that was when I realized what it appeared I had written: Bring Gun.

It took a meeting with my mom who said she had been meaning to get me gum and that there was no way I'd have brought a gun to school, a talk with my english teacher who backed me up on the fact that I often confused my cursive ""n"" and ""m"" and a meeting with the school counselor to finally clear my name.

2p6jjw,non_TBI,"So, I recieved a new watch a few days ago. It's a pretty decent one that runs apps and connects to your phone to allow you to read your notifications on the watch. It's lazy, but it's cool.

In any case, my morning was going as normal as ever, until I decided to go to the restroom. Now, this was no ordinary piss - the force was strong with this one. A few seconds in, I felt a vibration from my watch, which was conviently on the hand which held my pisser. I instinctively turned my wrist to look at my notification, only to realize the error of my ways as the yellow stream came my way.

This is where my second fuck up came in. Instead of doing the rational thing and moving my head away, I opened my mouth in shock.

That is the story of how I accidentally pissed in my mouth."
30t0f4,non_TBI,"As fuck ups go, this one is fairly unique. This is SFW and does not contain poop, jizz, or any other bodily fluids except for some cough spray.
I went with my friends to a popular non-franchised hot wings joint in our city. My friends are hot sauce enthusiasts. I'm a step above and am a hot sauce lover.
They were debating ordering the ""death wings, "" and I pushed them over the edge by telling them that there's no reason to order the ""girl"" wings since we are all hot sauce lovers.
So we ordered a pitcher of beer and a platter of the hottest wings the place serves.
The waitress tried to warn us, but no dice; we were on a mission.
Three pitchers and two platters later, we are all in pretty bad shape so we do what anyone else would do and go to the bar next door.
After the wings, my spit is basically a dangerous weapon and I know that the next day is going to be painful as fuck.
We all belly up to the bar and order beers and then the pitcher I drank tells my bladder that it's time to piss. So I head to the head. I do my deed and get back to the bar to find one of my friends in a western style knock down drag-em out brawl. He's holding his own so me and the other guy just watch.
And then the cops show up.
The fighters are separated and an officer asks who is with our friend. Me and my buddy step up and they ask us about what happened.
I explain I was in the toilet and I'm not sure. Then my friend starts to tell the story and this is when the FU happened. I spontaneously cough. I mean, I didn't have time to cover my mouth or anything and the officer receives a dose of hot chicken wing spit on his face. A bit got into his eye and after about 5 seconds it must've started to burn like hell because he grabbed me, threw me to the ground and cuffed me.
He kept asking what I threw on him... over and over....
I told him the truth that I just coughed and I had eaten super spicy wings next door. I apologized profusely but it didn't matter.
The fighters were released, I was thrown into a squad car and I spent the night in jail.
The next day, I was put in front of a camera and explained the situation to a magistrate who set my bail at $5000. I posted bond and am now out on bail awaiting trial for a felony cough.
The worse part was having to use the bathroom in front of the other ""inmates."" They didn't appreciate any part of it.
TLDR: coughed up a felony

* Edit 1: wow. This blew up. 
I will keep you guys updated. I spoke with an attorney. Details coming soon.

* Edit 2: My attorney pointed me to this link: http://jonathanturley.org/2007/09/27/man-arresting-for-coughing-on-officer/ It appears that I'm not the first to be charged with assault for coughing on an officer."
2omeca,non_TBI,"So I just found out that I did this last night. To give a little context, I'm a gay guy who lives with two girls and two other guys. A couple months ago it was one of my roommate's birthday, let's call her Jan. Now me and my other roommate who we'll call Mike thought it would be hilarious if we got Jan a dildo for her birthday. Now that may seem a little weird, but it's part of a long running joke between us because Jan has been single for so long. So we got her the dildo. Her birthday came along and we all had a good laugh about it.

Now the thing about the dildo is that Jan didn't want to keep it in her room because Mike and I would mess with her and make jokes that she was using it. No one else in the house wanted to keep it in their room either so eventually it ended up sitting in a drawer of a lamp stand in our living room.

Fast forward a few weeks. The dildo is still just sitting in the drawer. Now being a 22 year old single guy, I'm very horny. But I wasn't just in the mood for some porn, I was in the mood for some butt fun. That's when I remember the dildo. So I grab the dildo, get in the shower and do my business. I make sure to thoroughly clean it, dry it, and then put it back in the drawer. Over the next few weeks I do this several more times.

Now fast forward to last night. We have a few friends are over and we're all drinking, having a good time before finals start next week. One of the friends we have over, not one of out roommates, asks ""Hey, do you guys still have that dildo you got for Jan?"" All of us start laughing as we go over to the drawer and pull out it out. We're all still laughing and joking when someone asked Jan if she ever ended up actually using it. She didn't respond but she immediately got that look on her face that made it clear to every one that she had. 

The story doesn't end here though. Jan, thoroughly embarrassed, decides to call out our other roommate, Alex. Jan looks at Alex and yells ""Well I know for a fact you used it too! A few weeks ago when you and your boyfriend came back from that party. I was still awake in my room when I heard you two come in and start fooling around in your room. Then I heard footsteps and a drawer open and close. Once you were both back in your room I went out and checked and the dildo was gone."" 

At this point everyone is laughing hysterically except for me. I had just used the dildo again a few days beforehand and now I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that that dildo has been inside half of our household and I was the one to most recently use it.

TL;DR Some roommates and I got another roommate a dildo as a gag gift. It sat in a drawer seemingly unused but it turns out everyone was using it.

EDIT: Wow so this got a bit more popular than I expected it too and I guess I should clarify a few things. First, it does seem apparent that I am responsible for Jan getting a UTI after she used the dildo right after I used it. It wasn't very serious and she's totally fine now. 

Next, people are acting like I did this on purpose as part of some fucked up plan to get everyone in my house to share a dildo. We got a gag gift, and then is sat around seemingly unused for months. I was completely unaware that anyone else was using it. That's kind of where the fuck up comes in. I would also like to point out that we have all been very close friends since our freshman year of college. The joking around and teasing were all in good fun. We mess with her, she messes with us. That's kind of how our household dynamic works.

EDIT2: JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, NONE OF US HAVE STDS! We aren't just going around sleeping with random people that's kind of why we were all using the dildo in the first place. Can STDs really even be transmitted that way via dildo if its washed and then sits around for a while?

EDIT3: Well as some of you predicted, through the power of the internet this story made its way back to my roommates and now they know everything. Jan is understandably a little pissed off. Everyone else thinks the whole situation is fucking hilarious.

Finally, yes, dildos and sex toys galore are definitely on the the Christmas list this year. Also added a TL;DR

EDIT4: There have been multiple requests for pictures and descriptions of the dildo. Unfortunately I wont be able to post a picture at the moment because it is my finals week and I'll be in the library studying until very late tonight. However, here is the link to the one we bought. It's a pretty nondescript and boring dildo so I didn't feel the need to go into detail about it in the post.

29mam5,non_TBI,"I'm an intern right now and have quick a long bus commute to work. We changed office buildings yesterday into a much nicer tower and today I dressed a little nicer than usual for it. This involves a pencil skirt (problem 1).

I'm running a bit late and tried to jump down the steps off the porch to save time, I ended up having to catch myself in a tiger pose and heard a small rip tear the back of my skirt. I didn't have time to change so I quickly put a safety pin in and decided I'd fix it in the bathroom. Big mistake.

So I barely make the bus and get a window seat. An older man was behind me and shuffled in right next to me. I should preface that I was wearing big, over-the-ear headphones and couldn't hear much else. So I sit down and suddenly feel a sharp, piercing pain on my vaginal folds. Like all the way in there. I let out a scream, that was much louder than I realized what with my headphones, and the entire bus turns to stare at me. I readjust so that the head of the pin is no longer in my skin, and sit back down, trying to lessen the scene.

I'm still in a ton of pain but figure it's just a sensitive area. About halfway through my ride the man next to me stands up to get off and I notice a red stain on the corner of his jacket that was next to me. Horrified, I inch my ass off the seat and realize I'm sitting in a small pool of blood that has soaked through and ruined my skirt and is covering the seat. 

Now, I'm used to bleeding down there, but something about this being real blood made my stomach queazy. Got off the bus immediately and called in sick. Not today.

Tl;dr I safety pinned my vagina and bled on a bus and an old dude."
2v3fjz,non_TBI,"Super open-ended common title, I know. What could have gone wrong with this redditor's masturbation session.... It's a wonder any of us here at /r/TIFU even masturbate anymore..... Oh but we do.
Anyway, when I originally posted this it had happened this only moments before, but I forgot about the rules and so now I'm trying again, on a week end. This cant have happened in vain....    
    **Context:** So I've been trying not to masturbate lately for personal reasons. (Now before I get any comments or PMs referring me to /r/NoFap, I know already! This isn't a serious rule for me or anything, I don't need anti-fapping support, don't worry. But it is a lil' goal I set for myself.) I've been doing alright! Haven't gone to town on my down town playground for a normal amount of time for a decent human being. The Gods of General Genitals were pleased.    
    **The FU:** Now, I'm getting ready to go meet a friend, and so I hop in the shower to create some sort of illusion of being human. And in there, I see my shower head. I think to myself ""You know.... This isn't exactly going along with the promise I made myself but HEY, I've done pretty good. I can give myself a little reward...""    
    I grab that handy-dandy shower head, and start applying it to the necessary areas, using all them massage settings. (Oh yeah, you know what's good.)    
    So, we renovated fairly recently and in the beginning my shower was having all sorts of problems settling on a temperature to be. It would jump from freezing cold, to scalding hot all the time. But it's been a long, long time since anything like that happened, and I figured all that was behind me.    
    WELL I WAS WRONG.    
    Just as I was climbing to the point of hallelujah, the Gods decided to punish me and the heavenly cascade of water quickly turned to jets of burning hell-fire targeted at my very most sensitive area.

3pbnqp,non_TBI,"Obligatory ""this didnt happen today""

A few years ago I, being the dumb horny virgin I had been, was trying to find something to help me relieve myself, but having become bored of watching porn all the time I wanted to find a real chick. So I set out upon the many chat sites of the internet, found a girl on omegle and we immediately kicked it off. We seemed to have the same problem and decided we should move off omegle to skype. As soon as we were connected I started getting undressed and the girl on the cam started to as well and was asking for close ups of my dick. Obviously, I obliged and about five minutes later her cam changes to show me handling my junk. 

Confused, I ask what's going on and they tell me if I don't pay them a couple hundred bucks this recording was going to all my friends and family(my full name was on my skype), and being broke as I was I started freaking out and trying to convince them of my being penniless but they wouldn't have it and started a countdown. Freaking out even more, I summoned all the courage I had and told my dad what had happened, and he tells me to call the police about it. So I call the cops and a couple minutes later one is in our living room taking down what had happened. 

Oh yeah, I told the scammer I called the cops after being told to do so by my dad and they promptly stopped the countdown and disappeared, but with a policeman there I had to explain why he had been sent to my house. Praise be to this man that he did not laugh at the stupid thing I had done. He told me I should call the FBI as the skype account they used had an address on it and apparently this was quite common, but they never found out who it was so I didnt have to go to court to testify or anything.

I havent used omegle once in those years and dont plan on doing so for sexual reasons again, if at all. 

tl;dr got horny so I skyped a stranger, got blackmailed and had to contact the FBI and police department"
287p6n,non_TBI,"Normally, getting laid would not lead to a TIFU post, but today something so terribly fucked up was said that it warrants posting. My girlfriend and I are in the ""honeymoon"" stage of our relationship, and we have started having sex every night we are together. One thing will lead to another, and before I know it, the condom is on and we're getting it on. She had said several times that she is on birth control because she doesn't want children, so in the wee hours of the morning (after six shots of Crown), it seemed like a good idea to pass on the condom. Things are getting pretty heated and she is riding me cowgirl style. I warn her before I'm about to finish, and she holds me down and finishes me off inside of her. I'm basking in the afterglow, and she leans in real close and asks, ""How do you know I'm on birth control?"". My eyes widen, and before I can formulate a response, she says, "" Happy Father's Day"". She assures me that she is really is on birth control, but I can't help but think that TIFU.

Update: 10 hours later, my post has been discovered... Many lawls were had. I think I have a keeper!"
2ghmnn,non_TBI,"I really fucked up, reddit - and this one might just get me sent straight to hell. 

A little over a year ago now, I spent a couple months working as a volunteer in an orphanage in Northern Tanzania - and I had an amazing time doing it. The kids were all nothing short of fantastic, simply ecstatic to be alive each morning. While I was working there, my daily duties included some English teaching, and helping with the cooking and cleaning. I'd go back in a heartbeat if I could. 

For some background: In the first season of South Park, there's an episode called ""Starvin' Marvin,"" in which an Ethiopian orphan is sent to South Park. [Here's how he appeared in the show.](http://imgur.com/5TiBspD) My friends and I are all long time fans of the show, and  we would say we're ""Starvin' Marvin"" whenever we were hungry, and it kind of caught on after a while. 

As I was handing out lunch to the kids at the orphanage, one of them said to me ""thank you, I'm really hungry today."" This particular boy was especially skinny. He was healthy otherwise, but he had arrived at the orphanage incredibly weak and stunted. 

So I responded, out of simple habit and without thinking: ""Oh so you're Starvin' Marvin, hey?""

As soon as I said it, I realized what I had done. I immediately said ""Oh my God, I'm so sorry!"" Thankfully, he just kind of looked at me, a little confused. I don't think him or any of the other kids nearby knew what ""Starvin"" meant. But right after, the girl standing beside him pointed at him and said ""Starvin' Marvin!"" 

And it stuck. For the rest of the time I was there, the other kids called him ""Starvin' Marvin."" The few local teachers didn't know where it came from, and tried to put a stop to it, but it spread though the entire orphanage within a matter of hours. I never told them it was me. 

So what was the legacy I left behind in Africa? I gave an orphaned, hungry child the nickname ""Starvin' Marvin.""

Edit: formatting."
2tgkuv,non_TBI,"Repost from two days ago - original post was removed within an hour due to the reference to masturbation, which is only allowed in this sub during the weekend.  I'm still on foreign time, so I HOPE the weekend has started by now in the States.

About a year and a half ago I was part of a college trip to a foreign country with about 20 other students. The difference between me and the other students on this trip was that I had decided that I would be staying in this country to try to make a living for myself.

We were housed in a large building with many rooms that served as a dormitory for us. It was a very collegial atmosphere and we all had quite a bit of fun learning new things about the culture and language, as well as enjoying the foods and drinks that were either new to us or of better quality than what we normally get in America.

At the end of the trip, every student flew back home except for me since I was staying. I had the run of the place for a few days before I moved on to my new residence. It felt a little lonely, but at the same time pretty fucking awesome. At this point, realizing I was going to need every little bit of help I could get, I decided to scavenge the other rooms in search of items that could be of immediate or future use to me, and thus save me money - which was and still is of primary concern.

It was a treasure trove - the students left behind some surprisingly useful things (OTC meds, lint rollers, USB-powered clothes iron, etc.). Some of the other more frequently abandoned items were bottles of lotion. There were many different varieties, ranging from generic Jergens or Dove lotions to ""designer"" lotions in small bottles with varied fragrances and creative names like ""Country Chic"" and fancy bottles with labels of cartoon snowflakes and snowmen drawn upon.

In any case, being a lubrication-enhanced-masturbation enthusiast, I collected these with glee and gusto. Little did I know, but this would later prove to be my undoing.

Fast-forward three or four months or so. I had blazed through the Jergens and Dove lotions and moved on to the ""Country Chic."" Country Chic smelled fantastic, and was really a pleasure to jerk off with, however it came in such a small bottle that it only lasted for three sessions or so. When it looked like there wasn't going to be enough lotion for my next go-around, I shelved the bottle and opened the one with the snowmen on it.

The snowman lotion also served its purpose admirably, but was sadly in exactly as small a bottle as Country Chic.

That's when my greatest idea ever hit me:

""How about instead of throwing both bottles away, you just COMBINE the remainder of the two lotions into one bottle so that you can put off buying a new bottle of lotion for one more day! How does that sound, you fucking cheapskate?""

It sounded great, and it worked fantastically well...at first. I came home from the bar drunk as shit one night and rubbed one out, noticing a new previously unexperienced pleasant warming sensation that the new mixture of the two lotions afforded. I thought I had discovered something wonderful, and allowed the mixture of drunkenness and post-ejaculatory bliss to carry me into my sleepy wonderland. I woke up a little drowsy the next day, and like most days when I wake up, I instinctively grabbed my wiener. 

That was a big mistake.

After my arm involuntarily jerked away, the first thing I noticed was a SEARING pain that radiated out in all directions from my crotch and lasted several seconds - like when you accidentally scratch a particularly bad sunburn. I had barely taken my first waking breath before I had to painfully groan the remaining air in my lungs into my stark new reality: There was something SERIOUSLY wrong with my genitalia.

I decided to get out of bed. WRONG IDEA. Any time I moved my legs, or any part of my body for that matter, the subtle sympathetic movement of my scepter and crown jewels would elicit EXCRUCIATING pain. I decided to lift the covers and see exactly what I was dealing with. What I saw was terrifying.

Overnight, my penis and balls had mutated to three times their normal size. Ordinarily this in itself might have been a fantastic discovery, but my shaft and sack were both BRIGHT red and quite obviously extremely and PAINFULLY swollen. The swelling was so extreme that it looked like my circumcised penis had never been cut to begin with. I seriously could not even brush against my penis or scrotum with my fingertip without severe pain that would last for several seconds.
Then came the worst revelation: I had to piss.

Everyone here can relate to the first pee of the morning after a night in the bars. It is urgent. It will be voluminous. It cannot and should not be stopped.

I somehow found the strength to deal with the pain as I rolled out of bed and delicately traipsed to the bathroom - I could not walk normally without incredible pain. This was not going to be a stand-up operation. I had to swallow my pride and sit down. My bulging pecker peeped up over the lip of the bowl so I had to lean far forward while gingerly using one finger to delicately angle him downward as I watched, terrified and still in pain. I relaxed my ""pee-holding muscles"" and waited for the release, but it didn't come. I figured maybe there was a slight obstruction so I decided to push a little. Still, nothing. Keep in mind, the urge to pee was continuously incredibly strong.

Finally, I decided to push as hard as I could in order to get the flow going. That turned out to be a HORRIBLE idea. 

The flow of urine from my member came out as a minuscule squirt, about a 45 degree angle away from its normal path, and looked to be thinner than a strand of thread, AND this action was so excruciatingly agonizingly painful that I involuntarily screamed with pain and began to cry. Not a normal ""eyes watering"" type of cry, but a dirty, shuddering cry. I saw red, and felt like I was about to pass out. The entire piss lasted less than one second.

Even with what I just said about the urge to pee the morning after a night in the bars, I immediately gave up on the prospect of peeing at that moment, and began to try to think about what had happened. The only explanation I could come up with was that the mixture of the two ""designer"" lotions had produced some sort of combination that had caused a very severe reaction on my genitalia. I somehow managed to meander into the shower to try and clean whatever remained from that devil mixture off of my junk. However, my package was so damned sensitive that even the flow of water upon it hurt like hell, regardless of temperature.

I cleaned my willy as best as I could and found my way back into bed, extremely thankful that I had the next few days free. There was seriously no way I would have been able to do any sort of work in this condition. I somehow managed to get back to sleep.

Three hours later I woke up again, hoping that what I'd just experienced had been a nightmare, or at least something short-lived, and that since I'd managed to wash off a little of the lotion mixture's residue that I'd be on the fast track to normal penile health again. WRONG. The urge to pee was still as strong as it ever had been, and I couldn't even turn myself in bed without aching and burning all throughout my genitalia. The urge to pee this time, however, was impossible to ignore.

I waddled my way into the bathroom and sat down on the toilet. Leaned forward and hoped for the best before I gave a hefty push. I watched as the stream of piss came out - still at a 45 degree angle, but this time slightly thicker than last time. Did I mention that it hurt so much that I screamed the entire time? Somehow I found the strength to pee until I emptied my bladder. I don't think I've ever been so relieved in my entire life.

At this moment, I had to take the opportunity to examine the damage. I took my wiener gingerly in my hand, and angled him upwards to get a look at my peehole. I squeezed the tip a little, which normally allows the two sides to part, and noticed that the entirety of my urethra except for a tiny bit was seemingly fused together.

This was a cause for great alarm. However, being a rather modest person, and having very high hopes for self-recovery, I elected to wait and see how things played out in the next few days, as opposed to what a normal person would do - you know, calling a doctor and telling him you accidentally burned your dick shut because you're so damn cheap/poor you can't get a girlfriend and have to resort to masturbation using mixtures of lotions you scavenged from tourists. I didn't have anywhere really important to be or anything really urgent to do anyway. Also, my self-deprecative nature was REALLY kicking in at this point: ""You fucking idiot, why the FUCK would you do that, you deserve EVERYTHING that's coming to you"" and whatnot.

I went back into my room and laid down in bed. I then thought to examine the bottle in which I had mixed the two lotions. To my horror, instead of containing a ""lotiony"" mixture, it contained a blueish watery substance that had actually separated into a light blue foam on top with a transparent dark blue liquid underneath. I let the realization of my unfortunate mistake sink in as I tried to fall back asleep.

The next three or four days were spent laying in bed trying to sleep as much as I could, binge-watching Game of Thrones, and being terrified about whether I had caused irreparable damage to my junk. Only after those three days could I even put on a pair of pants without the friction causing unbearable pain.

Gradually toward the end of the week, the swelling subsided and the burned skin on my penis and scrotum began to harden and darken. Eventually it cracked and peeled off like a sunburn in large dark brown flakes. This entire time, every time I had to pee I had to sit down due to the funny angle of my pee stream.

The next week, I examined my peehole a little more thoroughly and was able to determine that the skin was still fused together in the middle of what had been its normal opening. I feared I would never again be able to stand up while peeing, as it had begun to come out in two decidedly differently angled streams. After a few days of this I got sick of it and pushed as hard as I could while peeing. The pressure was able to blast the fused skin apart - the moment of pain caused by that was nothing compared to what I had previously endured. Still, what used to be nice clean streams of pee had become a very rough, splattery flow (think Austin Powers' defrost piss scene - toward the end). It took another 3 or 4 weeks before I could pee normally again. Thank God there was no lasting damage, but to this day I can't pee without a moment of dread right before my flow starts.

From now on, I am very particular about my jerkoff lotions.

TL;DR: Mixed two ""designer"" lotions for masturbatory purposes. They interacted chemically and burned my cock'n'balls. RIDICULOUSLY immense pain and suffering. Fused my peehole mostly shut for about a week. Everything is ok now."
2c0fm4,non_TBI,"So this morning on my way out the door to work I grabbed a Capri Sun and a granola bar for the drive. There I was, in my new Toyota, happily opening the drink's little straw. Life was good. When suddenly -- disaster struck.

My morning flashed before my eyes as the straw slipped from the wrapper. I fumbled with it briefly in the air before watching, helpless, as it tumbled down, down into the crack that leads into the dark abyss beneath the driver's seat.

I tentatively followed the straw into the chasm with my hand, but, alas, the damage was done. My ruined fruit juice sat on the seat for the rest of the drive. Mocking me.

TL;DR - If anyone wants a strawless Capri Sun, it's all yours... *sniffle*."
2qtwmf,non_TBI,"This happened maybe a year or so ago and spanned around a month or two. Nothing graphic here.

On Saturday, I invited my best friend over to watch movies and with me. You know, just quality time. Both of my parents went out that day to go shopping, so we were alone when I thought it would be fun to look at my dad's browser history. I didn't expect to find anything. Unfortunately, I did.

The first few scrolls were just normal websites...then BAM, ""pussy"". I kind of stared in shock for a second before smoothly scrolling back up. My best friend obviously saw it and she laughed. I tried explaining to her and whatnot, saying it was ""probably a movie he was looking up"" or something. Nothing much came out of it though. She didn't seem to care that much.

But, I did.

The next time I looked was out of curiosity. I wanted to know who my dad really was. I don't know what I was thinking. This time, I was alone (fortunately), but that didn't make it any better. 

""Family sex""

Yep. I noped out of there and couldn't look my dad in the eye for a while. During which I actually looked once more at his browser history. This was what stopped me from forever looking at his browser history EVER.

""father daughter sex""

I scrolled a few times, because I couldn't believe it, but it was there. A few lines in history that he was stupid enough to leave there. I don't think he knows about incognito windows...

Anyway, from that point forward I couldn't look him in the eye for too long. I'm half scared, but pretty assured it's just a fantasy of his and has nothing to do with real life. He has hepatitis, so he can't really do it with my mom. Maybe that spurred his porn searching? I don't know, but I'll take this to the grave, because I will never tell anyone about this.

Except you guys. Huehuehue...

Thanks for reading.

Edit: Thanks for all the reassurances and explanations. I already knew it probably wasn't THAT big of a deal, but hearing that it's common puts me at ease. :D I'll probably gradually become less awkward around my dad eventually...one day...

Also, yes. I have learned my lesson the hard way and will never be so stupidly invasive of other people's stuff.

Edit2: I am his only daughter and child. I'm not saying I look down on him for looking at porn or even the type of porn. It was just something I NEVER expected to find (that particular genre). It's like thinking you know someone and then it turns out they're a serial killer, but toned down a whole lot. Still, I admit I was stupid as fuck.

Edit3: Sorry for edits, I'm doing this as I read the comments.
He has Hepatitis B, which is transmitted through blood and infected bodily fluids according to google."
2vv74j,non_TBI,"So this happened last night. With all the buzz about this 50 shades movie, I decided to understand S&M. So I spanked myself a few times, (I'm male btw) and got nothing from it. So I decided to go to town and spank myself as hard as I could, alas nothing. 

So here's where things went south. I went to my girlfriends place that night, and as we were about to do the no pants dance, she noticed 2 red hand prints on my ass. 

She flipped her shit, and I mean flipped her shit. She was screaming at me saying I was a dirty cheat. I tried explaining that they were my hand prints but she couldn't believe that ""anyone would be that retarded."" she won't return my calls or messages now. What do I do?

tldr: spanked myself that hard that it broke my relationship."
2ihet5,non_TBI,"I'm a housecarl for a certain well-known person, who I shall refer to as 'the dragonborn' to protect his identity. The dragonborn often has me following him around to assist in his various adventures.

Today was a day no different from any other day. He and I had just killed our third dragon that week and we were just about to head inside a cave to the South of Solitude. He decides he wants to train two-handed so he gives me his unique weapon, Chillrend before pulling a daedric greatsword out of his ass. We go in the cave and proceed. It was a typical ruin but we got through it quicker because I was using his sword. Everything is all well and fine until we get to the boss room. I pull out Chillrend and start charging towards this draugr overlord.

The draugr surprised me - as I went towards it it shouted at me, and Chillrend goes flying out of my hands. No problem, I still have an ebony sword that he never got around to selling so I decide to use that instead. We manage to take it down, the dragonborn loots the chests and we leave, continuing as normal.

Fast forward two days later. We've just cleared a bandit camp and the dragonborn says ""actually, I need to go back to one-handed weapons now. I'm taking Chillrend back.

Chilldrend. Oh shit! It's still in that cave! I start panicing and suddenly he starts cursing at me, saying ""What the fuck happened to my sword?"" and ""This game is so fucking glitchy"" 

Next thing I know, we're in the courtyard of the College of Winterhold and we start going down the bridge. He tells me to wait and moves back a bit. I suddenly hear ""FUS RO DAH"" and I go tumbling off the bridge, falling into the sea. I don't know where he went afterwards. He told me to wait, though, so I can't move. It's very cold down here.

2l287b,non_TBI,"So this fuck up happened on Halloween night but was removed due to it not being the weekend. I was out for Halloween with my mates, we were out in a club and we bumped into some people I know from university. I had just dropped some ecstasy like essentially everyone else there and was having a pretty good time. Now their is a mature student in our class shes 33 and is an attractive women, married and has two kids.We got talking and she ended up dropping a pill. We all arrive back at my house a group of about 7 people, where she tells me that she is a swinger and her and her husband have an open relationship. We are both on a serious lovebuzz so I think what the hell lets do this. We have wild sex after some encouragement to get my not so eager little man in the mood. So fast forward to the morning shes just left and I'm fighting the mother of all hangovers and what I know to b a fairly ruthless skag. I pass out and for a few hours and wake up a few hours later to some very angry messages from her husband on fb. He wants to know what the fuck I'm doing fucking his wife? Valid question only for the fact that I was under the impression that this was all above aboard. How wrong was I. He wants to talk to me so I man up and give him my number because the last thing I want is him beating down my door and causing a scene. I explained myself to him and told him I was under the impression they didn't have a monogamous relationship and I genuinely wasn't trying to cause any hassle. The conversation is short I think he was some what surprised that I didn't try to weasel out of my actions. So fast forward another few hour's and I'm lying here on my bed typing this, just heard from a friend that shes been kicked out of the house with her dog and a bag. I feel so terrible, I don't know if they actually were swingers or not but all I know I could have potentially played a direct role in the destruction of a family. I'll have to confront this situation again on Monday but until than I wont be leaving this room.
TLDR *I 22 had sex with a 33yr married classmate with kids who I believed to be in a swingers relation, Husband finds out gets in contact with me, kicks her out of the house and is not best pleased about the situation.***

Sorry for the lack of grammar people... I hang my head in shame."
2zx0p5,non_TBI,"This happened a couple of days ago but I had to wait to the weekend to post about it (per rule 3). My parents were at church, my father only goes to keep my mother happy and I don't share his concerns so I stay at home. I waited ten minutes after they left to make sure they weren't coming back and then headed up to my bedroom for some alone time. I set up my DVD and prepared to praise the lesbian goddesses of the celestial scissor kingdom. About five or ten minutes in I heard a THUD and then saw a man in a balaclava appear at my window, I was right at the apex of my orgasm (don't judge me I finish quickly) when he appeared and I have never felt such an amazing thrill and fear at the same time. I had to describing the entire thing to the police and my parents think I'm the devil.

EDIT: Alright guys, I only watch porn DVDs when my phone internet allowance has run out because my family don't have WIFI at our house.

He turns around and then I realize he is not my brother. He turns completely red. He was with his wife. Neither of them knew what to do or how to react. 
I stand there frozen and then  I run and hide trying to avoid them under any circumstance.

32w1gg,non_TBI,"Earlier today I bought some industrial strength spray bottles to use on the dogs as ""punishment"". Immediately upon discovering they are accurate past 15 feet a water fight breaks out in the house at 11:00 PM. Between two grown [ass-adults](https://xkcd.com/37/).

In my infinite wisdom, I decide to take the cat hostage because cats hate water and my girlfriend isn't a mean person. Not only did I underestimate how cold-hearted my girlfriend can be, but I did so while holding a cat.

Shirtless.

She nails the cat, the cat shreds me to pieces and here I am laying in bed waiting for the stinging to stop from my peroxide shower.

I have no regrets.

EDIT 2: Son of EDIT:  To the folks telling me that I'm an animal abuser and shouldn't have animals (not referring to /u/Qwerty2143 stop down voting him)...We do utilize positive reinforcement. The main issue is that we have a Boxer-Pitt mix that we rescued. Poor guy was pretty much attention starved and largely untrained. He's come a long way in the few months we've had him. But when he gets excited all training goes out the window. The only thing he responds to when he gets over stimulated is yelling or a belt in the hand as that was how his previous owner treated him. I'd prefer not to do that. This is also a huge issue when someone comes to the door and he gets aggressive/protective.  A short blast of water snaps him back to reality and he starts listening again. Then come the treats!  Also, get bent you self-righteous drip babies. (Credit goes to /u/Cephalapodus for introducing me to the term ""drip baby"")

2b57wm,non_TBI,"About two months ago, a friend of mine invited me to go on a trip to a lake he does every year. He owns a lake house and a boat, so I knew it would be a pretty kickass weekend. Sign me right up!

Fast forward and we make it to the lake around 10pm, party hard all night, and decide to take the boat out for the first time that next morning. Here's my fuck-up.

For those who don't know what tubing is- its basically connecting a large, inflatable, almost matress like (but round instead of rectangular) thing to the back of the boat with a special rope. You get on the tube and the boat pulls it. The point is to try to stay on the tube while being bounced and swerved around with waves. Its really fun. So I thought.

I had on fairly loose swim trunks that day. Fit fine around the waist, but loose around my legs. I strap on my life jacket and hop on ready for the ride. His tube was the kind where you sit on your butt with your legs facing he boat and hold on to handles at your sides.

So my friend starts the boat, turns back to me, and gives me a smile, wink, and thumbs up. That bastard. Right from the start he speeds the boat up and I'm jerked back in surprise. I manage to hold on, but it's a hell of a ride! I mean, he's turning left and right, speeding up, taking u-turns. This guy is TRYING HIS HARDEST to get me to fall off this tube! I'm  grinning like a fool and laughing, trying to hold on, and just having a great time. I look around and take in this amazing place: crystal clear warm water, the sun shining bright, the wind hitting my face.

And then I hit a wave that lifts the tube into the air. When I come down, my leg dangles over the edge and catches in the water we were speeding by. I can't hold on and I fall in. We were going really fast, and the wind had been getting underneath the leg of my swim trunks and lifting it up. When I fall, I turn and fall in on my stomach. The water rushed up the leg of my swim trunks and straight into my butthole. IT HURT. I felt the pressure of the water pull apart my buttcheeks and forcefully shove up my poor, unsuspecting asshole. It all happened so fast that when I surfaced, all I could do was let the life jacket keep me afloat. A million thoughts raced through my head. Did the water go in? Did I just lose my anal virginity to a lake? Is my butthole going to get infected? The boat circled around to get me, but I couldn't even swim towards it, I was so sore. They had to lift me into the boat. Everyone was laughing, telling me what a great fall I had. All I could do was smile awkwardly and try not to move my lower body much. They suspected nothing of what had happened.

As soon as we docked, I bee-lined it to the washroom. Something wasn't right, I had an immense urge to poop and I couldn't hold it in any longer. I barely made it, and as soon as I got on the toilet, I felt a swoosh of water come out of my asshole, followed by liquidy shit that just would't stop flooding out. I couldn't ride the tube again until the next day.

Tl;dr Went tubing on a friend's boat, fell off and was analy assaulted by the lake.

Edit: spelling


Edit 2: Wow, this got bigger than I thought it would! Glad you all enjoyed my special moments with that lake. 

If any of you want to listen to this story read out loud in a majestically deep voice, /u/Cyae1 did a [beautiful job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITICqnAHpAM&list=PLl0DkyQa9Aqu_aWjvjzvySIZC8PHUPPO6&index=14).

Edit 3: So now I know what an enema is. Thanks guys. Also, for all those asking what lake it was, it was called either Bullards Bar or Emerald Cove. My buddy kept switching the names back and forth. If any of you visit, tell that lake to delete my number. Couldn't even call me back after anal. *sigh*

3t04ub,non_TBI,"It didn't happen today, but it happened a couple days ago. 

I was on a nature hike for a few days and came back into town. I logged onto facebook shortly after arriving home. I logged onto my facebook, scrolled down my page and noticed almost every single one of my friends had a filter with the French flag.

I remembered when my friends put the LGBT flag as a filter to celebrate gay marriage becoming legal nationwide a while back. I assumed something equally positive or proud was happening in France.

I then posted: ""Congrats on the events in France. It must have been a glorious day.""

I go out grocery shopping, come back to facebook, and I find eight people defriended me. 25+ livid comments on my support of terrorists. 3+ messages by people who know me well -enough that I don't condone terrorism- asking if my account has been hacked. 

I explained my mistake and everyone seems chill right now. Although, I wouldn't be surprised if I was on some watch list right now.

"
2mgqls,non_TBI,"I am going to tell you the story of how what started as a simple shower ended in utter chaos. 

It started like any Sunday afternoon. Wake up around 1, consume candy for breakfast, see what's on TV. A few minutes in I got bored and realized a needed a shower because I stink. So i go in the downstairs bathroom, which is about 6 x 6 feet, and start stripping of my clothes. I also put on a shower cap because I'm a girl and I don't want to get my hair wet because I don't want to wait for it to dry. However I don't have one so I just use a plastic bag. Whatever.

I turn on the shower head, and that's when I see it. A GIANT fucking spider, chillin on the ceiling in the corner or the shower. Keep in mind I am someone who is not afraid to *stare death in the face*, but I am *terrified of fucking spiders.* We have a staring contest. My heart is pounding as I deliberate my plan of action. Also I am staying with my grandma, and there are no manly men to take care of the problem. I am on my own. 

Now what i usually do in this situation is kill the spider with an ungodly amount of dangerous chemicals until it dies. So I go to the basement (still naked, grandma is watching tv still) and find the most dangerous chemical i can find and settle on a bathroom cleaner. This are serious shit.

This is where it gets ugly.

I come back in the bathroom armed and start attacking. The spider crawls to the other side of the room, but this isn't good enough for me. I keep spraying, the spider keeps moving, and I'm getting this shit all over the ceiling and walls. Apparerntly it's the kind that starts foaming, and not only does it make a mess, it *releases these horrible fumes* and soon i can't breathe so i turn on the ventilator, which hasn't been used in like a year. Eventually the spider weakens and succumbs to its injuries, and falls to the floor by the toilet. I take an opaque cup and heroically trap the spider in it.

But it's not over yet.

Next course of action is to get this foam off, can't just leave it there. Meanwhile, the ventilator has gone from a normal quiet ventilator noise to an acute loud screeching, as if something were caught in it. Now, as i reach to wipe the shit off, not only does my arm get caught in an invisible spiderweb, but *daddy long legs* has crawled up the toilet I was standing on, and on my feet (opaque cup, never actually trapped it). The coinciding incidents cause me to freak the fuck out, and lose my balance. I grab the closest thing i can to catch myself, a towel rack, which cannot support my weight and therefor breaks off of the wall. 

And that is how my grandmother found me, naked on the floor with a plastic bag on my head, with a towel rack in my hand and in a bathroom covered in foam.

**TL;DR** find a spider in my bathroom, try to kill it, grandma finds me on the floor naked, bathroom covered in foamy bathroom cleaner

**Edit** I know daddy long legs are harmless, still have deep-seeded irrational fear. It was about 3 inches in diameter if you were to spread out its legs"
27kqk5,non_TBI,"It's hot as hell here today, so I didn't feel like cooking, and decided to order a pizza. Local place down the street offers free delivery and gets the pie over in like 30 minutes, so I call them up and order. I hear the doorbell and grab the money from my wallet, not realizing it was only enough for the pizza and not enough for a tip. (The guys who deliver for this place use their own car, it's the least you can do.) I told him to hang on a sec while I go back in for a tip. Now usually when the pizza guys leave their car unlocked and running, they're only away from them for like 30 seconds at the most, but he was waiting for me to come back. While I'm looking through my wallet, I hear the guy scream, ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" and an engine take off down the street. I look out the door and see him standing in the street, and he says, ""Some kids just stole my car!"" 

The only reason the kids had enough time to steal the car is because I made the pizza guy wait, so I feel kinda shitty about that. I invited him in after he called the cops, though, and we ate some pizza while we waited for them to come by and take a statement. Nice dude, and totally not upset with me about it, but I still feel like it was at least partially my fault. 

Edit: Wow! This got more attention than I expected. Thanks everyone! I get it that it's not literally my fault, but I still played a part in the situation. I just did what I could do to try to make the guy feel better. As a followup for those interested, I live in a quiet suburban town in New England, and this is totally not a common occurrence. Freak accident! I'm thinking of going down to the pizza place this week to check in and see if the police had any luck finding the dude's car. "
3m5qes,non_TBI,"Backstory:  My husband and I play a silly game while scrolling through the T.V. channels; the first one to yell ""¡Sí!"" when we come across a Spanish language station wins.

Well, tonight we went out to dinner and I enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine with my meal.  I was in a silly, giggly mood as we walked back to the car and passed by a homeless man muttering to himself in Spanish.  Instinctively, I yelled, ""¡Sí!""  This lascivious smile spread across his face and he started spouting off rapid-fire Spanish and heading straight for me.  

My husband yelled at the guy to back the fuck off, yelled at me to get the fuck in the car, and peeled out of there as fast as he could.

My Spanish is pretty much limited to ""sí"" and ""yo quiero Taco Bell"", so I had no idea what he'd said until my husband told me that the guy had asked if I'd suck his dick and I'd responded with an enthusiastic yes.

We're home now.  My husband is still mad at me and I can't stop giggling.
"
2ndhzn,non_TBI,"This happened on Saturday and I still feel like shit from it.

 **Minor spoiler below.**

So Saturday was the anniversary of my fiance's mother's death. It is still really raw so this day is a pretty sad one. We decided to take it easy and relax that night instead of going out. I suggest we watch a movie and what movie do I suggest? Fucking Guardians of the Galaxy. Neither of us have seen it before and had no knowledge of any character's back story. 

For those of you who haven't seen it and don't care about a spoiler, [Spoiler](/s ""Chris Pratt's character's mother dies in the first 5 minutes of the movie."")

I didn't think they would just kill her like 30 seconds into the scene on camera. I figured we would just know she died but god damn was I wrong. I just sat there in disbelief that it happened. She gets up, goes into another room, and is obviously upset. Needless to say I have only seen 5 minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy.

So I had gotten a significant gift card to Abercrombie & Fitch (AF) for Christmas and decided to use it to get some new clothes. Just to be clear, I have NEVER shopped at an Abercrombie store before so I didn't know what to expect. I waltz into an Abercrombie store and go straight to the long sleeve shirts and saw some medium ""muscle fit"" shirts. Being the wannabe tool-I-work-out-douche-complex-dude, I try on the shirt. Immediately, I get a short ego-boost thinking ""damn I'M FUCKING HUGE, this shirt barely fits!"" However, as I motion to take off the shirt, I realize that holy fuck I can't even pull it past my shoulders as I begin to wobble around blindly. A kind employee asks if I need help and assists me in removing the tiny shirt.

Now everyone in the store is beginning to glare at me and I don't know why. Being the douchebag I was, I shrugged it off and went on to try some other sweaters and shirts...all with the same outcome as before. Now Instead of helping me, the employees begin to laugh profusely. Then it suddenly dawns on me, I'm trying on fucking KIDS clothing inside a fucking KIDS clothing store. Everyone is staring at me like im a fucking child molester, deriving joy from tight children's clothes. I quickly toss my shit down and go running out of the store. No wonder why there were two separate goddam Abercrombie stores...A&F for adults and Abercrombie for kids. "
2lkng6,non_TBI,"I probably don't have to warn you that this is going to get disgusting.

I unexpectedly had a night off work the night before last, so I did what I typically do in these sort of situations: get blackout drunk and eat terrible delivery food.  I was playing some PC games with my friends and someone was ordering from Papa John's and joked about getting this abomination of American gluttony called the Chili Fritos pizza, which is exactly what it sounds like.  So being blackout drunk, I decided I must have one.

Well I somehow managed to eat this whole pizza in the span of 12 hours, and woke up with a raging hangover and the bubblegut.  I'd had a bad hemorrhoid for about a week up to this point, and shitting 5 times in a couple hours had enflamed my asshole to the point I was starting to wonder if a colony of fire ants had made a new home in my anus.

I barely made it through the 2 1/2 hour drive to Washington DC for work without crapping my pants, and immediately rushed for the bathroom.  After a 20 minute poop and tenderly wiping while trying to avoid contact with my now hideously engorged hemorrhoid, I checked in with our client.  She has a bad habit of talking for hours at a time, and tonight she was feeling particularly chatty.  

I stood for an hour listening to her talk, and suddenly I felt my stomach bubble again.  I had to fart in the worst way, but I also knew there was a good chance it would be a shart and even if it wasn't it would stink.  So I crossed my legs casually and squeezed my cheeks to hold it in.  I felt an intense stabbing sensation in my ass and then something warm running down my leg. 

I stifled back the tears, and then I realized the predicament I was now in.  I'd ruptured my hemorrhoid and my ass was now bleeding profusely in a meeting with the owner of a $44 million dollar building and our company's biggest client.  I tried to casually break away and back out of the room so she wouldn't see my bloodstained pants, but to my dismay she started to follow me out.  She got a few feet away and her face screwed up and went pale.  I'd been too panicked and distracted by the pain and hadn't noticed the awful stench emanating from my rear.

At this point I explained I wasn't feeling well and ran to the restroom where I hid until she left for the night.  I'm currently laying on my stomach in a bed of shame.

Tl;dr don't eat pizza covered with corn chips or you'll bleed from the ass uncontrollably. 

EDIT: YIFU by not using a throwaway account to tell my tale of bleeding profusely from my anus before it hit the front page.

3ck4c3,non_TBI,"So I was in English class earlier today and the teacher (really laid back guy, jokes around with is and goes off on tangents all the time) was talking about formal vs. informal language. He says: ""You wouldn't speak to your parents the same way you, say, text your best friend."" Now, I have this kind of running joke with my best friend where he's my ""Daddy"" (Google Daddy kink if you are uninitiated). So I whisper to my friend sitting next to me (let's call her Anne): ""Fuck me harder Daddy"" (all my friends know about the ""daddy"" joke so she knows what I'm talking about).

She completely loses it. She's crying with laughter and everyone looks over to see what she's laughing about. Teacher says: ""Anne, what are you laughing about?"" Anne says: ""Something /u/flyhalfboy said."" Teacher says: ""/u/flyhalfboy would you like to repeat what you said to Anne?"" Through tears of laughter, I refuse. By now the whole class wants to know and everyone's chattering and giggling. Another friend on my table (we'll call him John) asks me what it was. So I tell him, and he loses it aswell.

Teacher asks me to write it up on the whiteboard. Again, I refuse. He insists that, as long as it's not about anyone in the class, I won't get in trouble. This goes on for a while, until John, my knight in shining armour, goes up to the board and writes: ""Fuck me harder Daddy"". The class erupts into laughter and I worry I will be forever known as the boy who gets fucked by his dad.

TL;DR: told my English class that my Dad fucks me.

EDIT: Holy shit front page this is a new experience for me"
2bi9ik,non_TBI,"So I'm hoping writing this down will make it funny instead of just annoyingly stupid. I recently got a new and awesome job. It's distributed so my office is my computer...awesome. I was showing my boyfriend, a certified software geek, around my digital office. He leaned over my shoulder and so I have his neck a kiss and started kissing up to his chin. He caught my drift pretty quickly and we went to the bed. 

Both of us enjoy sex on the rough side, nothing too extreme, but this day he was a little more into it then normal. Mostly just dirty talk and a little spanking but some choking too. Of course I'm a little more vocal and have always thought I sounded like I was in pain when I'm not. Of course things went as they normally do. All in all it was awesome and both of us were having a great time. Until my blinking screen caught my eye. 

Our meeting software was on and evidently broadcasting. I keep a black sticker over the camera but still sound was probably perfectly audible. I screamed ""no, stop!"" and thinking he hurt me my boyfriend launched away from me like a burned cat. I ran over and checked the meeting software and it seemed like no one else was on. I turned it off and told my boyfriend. Both of us were laughing in relief at what was our near escape. Or what we thought. 

About a minute later there is a pounding on the door with a police officer  who was bound and determined to arrest my boyfriend for rape. Evidently one of my coworkers did sign on, hear what sounded like a woman in pain and a man going ""yeah, you like that? yeah you do."" We both tried to talk to the officer who looked like he wanted to punch my boyfriend in the face. I tried to tell him it was all a misunderstanding. I let the police officer take me to the hospital while iterating over and over again that it was just sex, I was a willing and happy party in it. I had to tell a dozen nurses and doctors, receive a humiliating exam and received more pamphlets on rape then I knew existed and my boyfriend is now petrified of my computer and dead silent when we have sex. 

TL;DR: Had rough sex with my boyfriend while company meeting software was on lead to the police being called and my boyfriend nearly being arrested for rape. "
20xkh9,non_TBI,"Reddit I fucked up. I was sitting in my office and I kept getting a faint smell of ass. It kept coming and going and it was bothering me. So I get up my chair and the smell multiplied by ten. My office was supper hot and my leather chair was making my ass sweat like a pig. WTF. So I grabbed some hand sanitizer and wiped my chair and then headed to the bathroom. I wiped my ass of all the sweat and went back to my office. 


Around 10 the smell is back with a vengeance. I grab the hand sanitizer and lock myself in the bathroom and start cleaning my asshole with hand sanitizer and wiping with toilet paper. Did it til I almost ran out of sanitizer. Put the rest into a piece of folded toilet paper and put it between my butt cheeks. Finally the awful smell was gone and I went to my office.


I could feel a tingly burning sensation coming from my anus but it went away. I kept working and didn't pay attention to it as it didn't bother me. The office was still hot but I no longer smell the ass scent. It's around noon now and the smell is back faintly. No problem I just go the bathroom and repeat my little trick of hand sanitizer on toilet paper. 

So its about 3:00 pm I've changed that shit about three times and now and I feel a little buzzed. My boss told me to go home because I look a little off today. Im sitting in my car right now typing this in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Im going to take a nap hopefully I'll get sober enough to drive home.

**TL;DR** **Drank 12 oz of hand sanitizer through my butthole and now am too dizzy to go home**

Edit: Made it home. I'm taking a shower and going to sleep. Bought a Gatorade on the way home and I feel a little better. WTF was I thinking.

Edit 2: Just so you guys don't get the wrong idea I'm a very clean person. I shower every morning before work. Today I was running late and I didn't. I have baby wipes at home to wipe my ass but I ran out so I just used regular toilet paper and headed out the door. I automatically assumed the odor was coming from me since I didn't follow my usual routine. I freaked out I wanted to make it go away in any way posible. I think I got some mild alcohol poisoning from doing something clearly stupid. I really want to blame the chair but who knows maybe it was really me. 

**Final Edit**: The chair smells like ass. I took a good whiff and got out of there gagging with tears in my eyes.  So I can picture it now. My assistant manager sits in my chair all day when I'm off playing boss. While I don't mind that I'm pretty sure there is someone wrong with his ass. He stank my chair over a period of 6 months. Now that the weather is getting hotter the stench is coming out. Im sitting in a metal foldaway and my new chair should get here in a couple of days. It was 62% Ethyl Alcohol in case you were curious. Thank you guys.

**TL;DR Blamed ass for stank im my office and got mild alcohol poisoning trying to cleaning it. It was a my leather chair infused with my assistant body odors and brought to life with the heat in the office**"
2pg3qy,non_TBI,"This fuck up happened years ago while I was in high school, but reading another TIFU reminded me of it.

**Fuckup #1** A little while before class I'd eaten something that did not sit well with me.. my stomach was hurting pretty badly, but I was a good student, so I decided to go to class anyway.

The first half 30 minutes of the class went fine, but I was slowly getting a building feeling somewhere between needing to shit myself and needing to fart.  Not wanting to miss class, I decided I could just hold it until the end of class. I felt the unavoidable fart building inside of me and prayed that I would be able to release it without anybody hearing me.

My execution was flawless.  I kept my pucker just tight enough to not shit myself or make a loud farting noise, but loose enough that my fart could escape. A socially awkward situation was successfully avoided.

But the smell... oh my god, it was terrible. People around me starting asking what the hell the smell was and making accusatory remarks. Fortunately I had enough awareness of my limited social capital and the ""who smelt it dealt it"" rule to not be the first to say something, but I also didn't want to stand out for not saying anything, so I soon joined in on the accusations. And frankly, the smell was entirely gag-worthy. To this day I've never smelt anything so bad.

But joining in on the ""oh my god who's doing that please stop/leave the room"" turned out to be **fuckup #2**.  Because the farts just kept on coming. The unending tension and pucker control required to quietly continue the controlled fart release was nerve wracking. One miscalculation and I'd have shit everywhere or make a noise lough enough everyone could hear it and I would no longer be able to deny it.

But now I was completely committed to the situation. There was no backing out, no leaving the room discreetly. If I left the room, everyone would know it was me. Not to mention the difficulty of standing without shitting myself.

By this point, enough noxious fumes were released that quite literally the entire room was gagging.  The teacher opened the windows at the back of the room, the doors at the front of the room, and my classmates began to refuse to remain in the room and started to stand out in the hallway. It was that bad. If it weren't for my need to focus on keeping my internal situation under control, I would have joined them.

Eventually, my poor math teacher gave up and ended class. Everyone was so distracted by the smell that there was just no point trying to continue.

I'd released enough gas that it had become impossible to tell who/where the epicenter was. I, like everyone else, cleared out of the room, and no one noticed my carefully clenched ass slink away to the bathroom to release my inner kakatoa. My secret has remained safe to this day.

1dslkx,non_TBI,"I haven't played soccer in years, but some of my buddies were
playing one morning so I joined up with them. After a few minutes of kicking the ball around
I'm standing near the mid-field line, maybe 40-50 yards from the goal, and the guy
playing goalie shouts to me, ""Hey, 100 bucks if you can score on me from there!"". I
played a lot of soccer in my younger years, so I know it's within my range. He was playing way
off the line so I just had to get it over his head. So I start taking my steps to the ball,
then put all my effort into kicking the ball as hard as I could. As soon as I strike the ball,
I yell ""FUCK!!!"" in excruciating pain, open my eyes, and realize I was still in my bed, dreaming.
I had kicked the wall barefoot with full force in my sleep; pretty sure I broke two toes. 
Never did find out if I won that 100 bucks.

2nlfla,non_TBI,"My mom just moved out of my house two weeks ago, so naturally I'm embracing my new found freedom.

This morning before work I decided that every dildo/plug/vibe I own needed a good cleaning before this weekend so my man and I can have a bit of fun. A few minutes later everything is all clean and sitting up to dry around my bathroom sink. I then quickly get dressed and rush out the door to work. 

Now this is where the fuck up comes in. I left them there. All 10 of them and went to work. Now I just recieved a call from my mom saying that she is swinging by tonight (while I'm still at work) to drop off some groceries and pick up some stuff she left behind.

Unable to think of an excuse as to why she can't do that or use my washroom tonight I just squeaked out an ""OK"" and hung up the phone.

FML Reddit. I can't wait for the phone call I'll get later.


**UPDATE:** So I just called my mom on the way home from work and apparently she and my step dad found my collection quite amusing.

The story I was told goes:

Mom walked into the house put the groceries down and immediately went in to the washroom while my step dad went to work fixing the sink in my laundry room. Mom obviously saw the toys and had a bit of a giggle. She went about her business until my step dad decided he needed to use the washroom. Apparently she ran in there grabbed them all to try and put them away before he could see but it was too late. She got caught in the hallway with an arm full of dicks. They apparently were both dying of laughter.

And to top off the embarrassment of both of my parents seeing the collection she thinks ""the purple swirly one it's kind of neat.""

2l9f9k,non_TBI,"I work in a hotel as a night auditor. For those that don't know that is basically the front desk person that works 11pm to 7am ish. Anyways, one of my jobs is to deliver receipts under all the doors of people checking out. I start on the bottom floor and I work myself up to the top floor. Tonight, when I got to the 8th floor (top floor) I decided to take the elevator down. The hotel was very quiet around 4am and hadn't see anyone in several hours. As I was on the elevator down I had to fart. No ifs ands or butts about it. I NEEDED to fart. So i did. As I get to the ground floor there is a guest standing there waiting to get on the elevator. In my head i'm like ""Damn I shouldn't have farted in the elevator."" As the guy walks into the elevator I just hear him gasp ""OOHHH man! Seriously?"" and I didn't see him after that. And thats how TIFU, but it was super funny at the same time. "
35oesr,non_TBI,"Throw away account for obvious reasons...

Oh my… where to begin?  A little background- last December, my wife and I became aware that our barely 16 year old daughter was in a “relationship” with a 24 year old woman.  Our daughter has been openly bisexual for some time now and has had both boyfriends and girlfriends.  My wife and I are both very accepting of this and have been nothing but supportive.  However, we obviously had a major problem with a grown woman showing interest in our high school sophomore.


I first became aware of the situation after chancing upon a secondary account my daughter had on Tumblr.  After a little research, I quickly realized that the person she was referring to as her “fiancé” was a grown adult… and a predator.  A search through her phone yielded even more damning evidence… this woman was sending messages to my daughter asking her to come sleep in her bed and asking her to get married.  There were also pictures of this woman embracing my daughter at Wal-Mart… pictures that showed the woman who was clearly an employee of Wal-Mart dressed in her associate vest and touching my daughter while she was on the clock.  


I of course lost my shit.  I called the local police department and even went as far as to file a complaint with the corporate Wal-Mart ethics committee.  I felt disgusted that a grocery shopping trip could lead to a predator having access to my daughter while on the job.  The police took a report, stopped at the house to talk with my daughter about the situation, and also called the woman to tell her to cease contact.  The Wal-Mart ethics committee however never called, emailed, or addressed the situation in any way after the initial report, despite stating that I would receive a response within five days.


Fast forward a few months and everything seems good.  We chose a different store to shop at.  Checking the monthly phone bill and social media accounts showed no contact between the two.  (Blocking all phone/ internet access was out of the question due the fact that our daughter is home schooled and also attends post secondary classes at the local university.) That was until one night last month that my daughter’s cousin stayed for a sleep over and told my wife that the two had still continued to talk through third party apps on her cell phone.  No trace of the conversations on the cell usage that way and all messages were immediately deleted as soon as they were read.


We immediately took her cell phone, iPad, etc…blocking all contact to the outside world and her access to the woman preying on her.  I realize the world a teenager lives in and how everything is magnified in importance, however I could not wrap my head around how a 24 year old woman would defy police orders and ignore the resounding call of common sense to continue talking to an underage child.  A gentleman that used to work for me was one of the woman's current co-workers and confronted her after finding out that she continued to maintain the relationship after the initial warnings.  She responded that someone must have been pretending to be her because she had not had any contact since the police told her to stop.


This denial was absurd and a blatant lie.  Over the past weekend, my wife and I were out shopping by ourselves and stopped into the Wal-Mart that the woman worked at for groceries.  The woman works in the tire/ automotive department which was already closed for the night so I knew that we would not have the chance of running into her.  Due to the recent  knowledge of the continued, ongoing contact and the fact that Wal-Mart never responded to my initial complaint, I decided to write a note addressing the situation.  I penned a letter stating the facts… this woman is a pedophile and she has already been warned once (no other accusations, no foul language… short, sweet, and to the point.) “Attention Wal-Mart Associates… Needs to be known that (REDACTED) is a pedophile.  You have been warned once.”  I addressed it to the associates and walked behind the tire counter and left it laying on the back counter out of the view of customers.  I felt if corporate was not going to address my concerns, I would do it myself.


The note was left Friday.  I got a call from the local police department today (Monday) asking me if I had left a note at the local Wal-Mart over the weekend.  I replied that I had.  The officer said that my name had come up in the “investigation” and that he had pulled the previous report from last year and understood the situation… however, Wal-Mart was filing a trespass warning against me and was in turn banning me from all Wal-Mart stores in the United States.  Their reasoning was that I had walked behind the counter to leave a note…a counter without a door, without a gate, and without a employees only sign.  An empty counter with no merchandise, no open register.  I was told that if I am seen in a Wal-Mart, I will be arrested.  How long is the “ban?”…. Forever, according to the officer and the wishes of Wal-Mart.


So a TIFU or really a TIL...the lack of interest that Wal-Mart has in keeping its customers safe from their own employees… and how quick they are to ban a father for life who is protecting his child.  Corporate cannot respond to a very serious situation, but a local store can be quick to take action without addressing the larger concern.

TL;DR: My 16 year old daughter is being preyed upon by a 24 year old female Wal-Mart employee...left a note at her job calling her out; got banned from all Wal-Mart stores for life.


Edit 1: Appreciate the support from some of the people that are obviously parents here...going to answer a few concerns from the people jumping to conclusions about certain things:

My daughter attended public school up until the end of her first semester of freshman year.  She requested to be home schooled (it's actually an online digital academy for the local school system.)  It was never something we as parents suggested.  The college classes she takes are regular college classes at the university...not continuing adult education as someone else suggested.  

My daughter first met this woman when she was 13-14.  The woman at that time was working at gas station by her school.  The grooming started then...a bouquet of flowers were delivered for Valentines day when she was 14- never did I think at that time they were from a woman in her twenties.  

Edit 2: Wow...this really blew up.  I have read through a lot of the comments and will try to respond to individual ones but figured I could knock out quite a few questions/ reoccurring themes with another edit.  And sorry I didn't respond sooner, I wasn't avoiding the chance to respond because i didn't like some comments.  I was working all day and don't have the ability to browse reddit on the clock.

So just some quick highlights...

-Some have responded that I am being overprotective...while others have wondered where was I when she first met the woman.  So which is it?  Can't have it both ways.  I initially knew she had a friend, knew her name, and didn't pry any further...why would I? 

-My daughter honestly could pass for 12-13 at 16...she's barely 5ft and weighs 85 lbs soaking wet.  The woman in question is a good eight inches taller than her and outweighs her by 100 lbs.  When she posted the public embrace on social media and professed her love to this woman, my daughter was met with a barrage of comments asking her why she was dating someone old enough to be her mom.  Seriously, she looks as old as my wife.

-As I stated earlier, the homeschooling is sponsored through the local public school system.  They have study sessions, field trips, etc where she interacts with her peers...peers her own age.  She is also active in groups outside of school and has quite a bit of social interaction...but good for those that jumped to conclusions otherwise.  As I previously stated, her college classes are through the local private university...the post secondary option is paid through being a student of the digital academy.  She received nearly 18k worth of college education this year for free as a high school sophomore...but I'm an idiot for letting her home school?  Tell me more oh wise posters of reddit.

-After initially finding our about the relationship the first time around, my wife and I had quite a few heart to hearts with our daughtwr asking why she felt so strongly for this woman and expressed our concerns in a very rationale way.  We asked her what was important at this time in her life and talked through a lot of feelings...that was why it was such a shock to find out that they were still talking.  

-The relationship I have with my daughter is actually quite good.  I honestly don't feel she resents me...she's not the ""fuck you dad"" teenager and I think she is just confused and at a very vulnerable state at this time in her life.  She is at an age that we actually like the same music and have gone to quite a few all ages shows together and that feels pretty awesome as a dad.  We've talked about some of the same insecurities and issues I had growing up that she is now experiencing which has seemed to help.

Like I said, I will try to respond to individuals as I can...and hopefully address some more comments in general as I get to them. It has been interesting to read some comments and is easy to see people's ages and if they are parents just by their reactions."
2mjure,non_TBI,"This happened last night.

I hyped the movie up and took my dad to watch it with me before I really found out anything about it other than Nolan - McConaughey - spaaaace - excellent scores.

We were about 8 minutes late coming into the theatre because we couldn't find a parking spot, and when we walked in, the movie had already started. I found this a bit odd because I expected there to be about 20 minutes of trailers before it started, but whatever.

Anyways, the movie was quite good but it was extremely rushed and we both agreed that the introduction was poorly done and it took us a while to catch up to what was going on, even though we only missed the first ~8 minutes of playtime.

About 90 minutes later the movie ends and we walk out of the theater kind of disappointed. I got pretty pissed when I saw on IMDB that the runtime was 179 minutes but the version we saw was cut down to 90 minutes.

So, the next morning I call the theatre to see what the deal was and maybe give them a lot of shit for thinking they had a right to edit Christopher Nolan's work themselves (cause I couldn't find any info on other theaters doing this).

And then I realized what we did. We fucking walked into the wrong projection hall... The movie was playing in two halls simultaneously and we picked the one that started about an hour and a half earlier...

Fuck."

2qcvsm,non_TBI,"Ok, so let's start by saying that I don't like popping pimples, because I'm afraid they will leave scars or holes on my face. 
Story time....

So last night, I was at a christmas party, enjoying myself eating good food, opening nice gifts, etc. There was this cute girl there (not a relative for all of you wondering), and we were talking and dancing and having a good time. When the time to leave comes, you give everyone goodbye hugs and cheek kisses, which is really just an awkward cheek bump. When its my turn to say good bye to this girl, we bump cheeks, and I feel a sharp pain on my cheek. Then I remember the pimple, feel for it, and felt the wetness of a popped pimple. I then looked at the girls cheek, and see the puss mixed with blood mixture on there. I, however, am too embarrased to tell her, and just watch her give other people goodbye kisses, spreading the bacteria of my pimple around.

  **TL;DR:** At a xmas party with huge pimple on my cheek, dance with cute girl. Time to leave, cheeck kiss, and my pimple explodes puss all over her. She smudges it on other peoples cheeks."
1krqof,non_TBI,"I had just gotten back from the gym and decided that a shower would be pertinent. Soon after the shower began, I got a little horny. The showerhead and I are *intimate* friends. I set it to pulse, lay on my back on the tub floor, and reintroduced my clitoris to her watery lover. As I got close, I decided that if the water were just a tad hotter, it would significantly improve my orgasm. Being on the edge of cumming, and thus disinclined to sit up and turn the temperature knob a little warmer, I decided to use my foot. Predictably, my foot slipped and I sent the water temperature from warm to thermal vent. I now have  an icepack between my legs.

TLDR; I wanted to cum, got cooked instead."
2mxixj,non_TBI,"I had been out for a long night of drinking and ended up crashing at a family friend's house at around 6 AM. I woke up some time around 8 AM and still felt drunk. I remembered that most of my stuff, including my pants, was in the guest bathroom down the hall. The problem was:

A) I could hear his family having breakfast

B) I had a lumberjack-esque case of morning wood. 

Being keen to leave, and still in a heavy daze under the sheets, I defaulted to doing the waistband trick to hide my erection. I started walking through the living room -- only to be halted by a large collective gasp. It wasn't because I was in boxers, it was because I had forgotten that the waistband trick only works if you're wearing a shirt. I tried to play it off by saying, ""It's an optical illusion."" Surprisingly, I haven't been invited back since.


**Edit: Definition** | The waistband trick is where you tuck your boner up into the waistband parallel to your body and under your shirt to avoid unintentially displaying your goods to people"
2r6sjg,non_TBI,"This happened 20 mins ago. So I always thought boobies were nice. They were soft and squishy and pretty and fun. I thought hey! I think girls are pretty, boobs feel nice and pussy is cute. Maybe I'm bisexual or a lesbian? So I took a girl on a date. It was fun and one thing led to another and candles were lit, music was playing, no words existed but the sound of us kissing.
I felt like a playa. I wined and dined this pretty girl and she totally wanted me. I was feeling egotistical. She was on top of me,
Grinding into me. Her back was arching, soft whimpers and moans escaped her pretty mouth. And then I sat there, boob in hand and thought ""man I could really go for penis right about now"". And then
It hit me as she started to go down my pants that shit! I don't want to finger her. I don't want her fingering me! Just not my Thing. At all. So I finished the movie with her and was curteous and saw her out.
But now I have to figure out how not to be a jerk and not see her again. I fucked up.

Right [here](http://youtu.be/7n39RzgVNP8) thanks! :) 

Update: So I told the lady I took on a date last night that she was beautiful, wonderful, sweet and kind and a ton of fun! But it just so happens I'm not as much into girls as I had thought. Just not right for me personally. But she is awesome and kind and I had a great time! And she sounded disappointed but in the end was okay with it. Said she understood.
Thanks for your help my fellow redditors!"
1ax8x8,non_TBI,"My best friend was sent home from school because she had an upset stomach. I went over her house today to see how she was doing. She still wasn't feeling good, but I stuck around and chatted with her for a few hours since both of her parents were at still work. 

When I was leaving, I gave her a big hug and said that I hope she feels better. As soon as I did, she simultaneously projectile vomited down my back and had explosive diarrhea in her pants. She backed away from me before I could react, tripped over the rug, and split her head open on a table. Blood was everywhere, I'm covered in puke, and there is shit in her pants. Great.

I carried her to my car and raced to the hospital. I called her parents and told them what happened also. She needed 20 stitches in her head and a change of clothes. TIFU


EDIT: Thanks for the gold, anonymous user!"
2xvt8m,non_TBI,"This fuck up has been brewing about 4 days, but was actually realized today. I go to an engineering school that has about a 3 to 10 ratio of girls to guys, so naturally I have been playing the game of tinder for the past week or so. I matched with a pretty a girl who was a definite 1 on the binary. We exchange numbers and start texting. Eventually she askes me if I have snapchat, and I'm like hell yeah! I give her my userID and the conversation changes to something else. An hour or so later I get a (friendrequest?) on snapchat. The username is in the format of jibberish.kim. The girls name is kim. I then get a snap of a dog, and of a fire that displays the time of night with the caption saying like XXX states weather is the best, you know, typical early 20's girl type snaps. Later she messages on the self erasing text me saying ""Hey qbecker, how was your day?"" I reply back saying good ask how shes doing..small talk.  The next day she messages me and we make small talk again,I try to be semi flirty, but she doesn't seem into it. This continues for a few days in short bursts. Eventually I notice how hard it was to keep a conversation going. The things she was saying were inconstant and a little strange. She asked about my phone, and when I have an upgrade, weird shit. The next day I get a snap from her and its a math book, with the line ""foo.bar is my favorite teacher"" I am then thinking what the fuck? This girl goes to my school. So I text(on the phone) and say ""you go to nameOfMySchool???"" she tells me ""no...."".  I'm like ""But you just snapped me saying foo.bar is your favorite prof?"" she then proceeds to tell me she hasn't actually made a snap chat yet so she doesn't think it was her. I get confused and message the impostor snapchatter saying who is this?? Then it happens. HE reply's with a picture of his face. Of course it is the autistic Asian kid from my first calculus course. I have never laughed so hard/been so glad I didn't send a dickpic in my entire life.

tl;dr tried to flirt with a MALE Asian.


edit. Male Asian.

2f2lmz,non_TBI,"A few years back I'd hooked up with a girl at a party but didn't manage to seal the deal. A few weeks later she invites me up to her place to go on a 'proper date'. It's a little distance away, so it takes me a couple hours to drive up there. We go out to dinner and end up drinking a bottle of wine (or two). I can't drive home, I'm drunk. One thing leads to another and bam, first date sexy time.

Now next morning I had to be somewhere early; I had planned to be home the previous night so I was gonna be super late if I didn't haul ass. When I got up to leave it was still dark. I didn't want to wake her by turning on the light, so I grabbed my clothes, stuffed them into my bag and hit the road. 

Later that day I'm home and getting my clothes out the bag. And that's when I saw it, peeking out from behind my t-shirt. My dates dainty pink thong. I reflected on this a moment and realised how this might look. I got a girl drunk. I insisted I had to sleep at her house, as I was also drunk. Took advantage of said drunkenness, and slept with her. Got up in the dead of night to abandon her. And then stole her panties for good measure.

In the end I settled on a text... ""Please don't think I'm weird, but I stole your panties by accident"". This was 5 years ago. Next week is our wedding. Had to tell the story here cause I sure as shit can't put it in the speech!

33c269,non_TBI,"First of all I wanna say thanks for saving my day, with all of your TIFU's! I can't tell you how many hours I've spend laughing, and how many sleepless nights you have been given me ;-) So now I wanna share my TIFU, which didn't happen today but about 2-3 weeks ago... I'm traumatised for life... 

(I apologies if my grammar isn't correct, but I hope you'll get the point anyway) 

My name is Michael. I live in Denmark, and I was visiting my GF for about 2-3 weeks ago. She lives about 200km/124miles away, so it's rarely we see each other. 

I'm waking up a Saturday morning, and as a lot of other guys I have to take a piss like the Niagara Falls in the morning. So I just woke up, my head's kinda fuzzy, and i'm heading for the restroom.... What I didn't remember, because I just fucking woke up, was the fact that her parents never (**NEVER!**) lock the god damn door. 

So I opened the door, and there she was. My GF's mother, completely naked with big hanging tits. I didn't know what to do, so i just shouted ""WOAOOUUOOOO""-ish, smacked the door, and heard her laugh afterwards. Then I backed my head up against the wall outside. ""Wow""? Was that the fucking word I choosed to scream when I saw her naked? Jesus Christ.... I'm not sure if she thinks I was turned on or afraid.... Traumatised, guys... *Traumatised*..... 

TL;DR: Had to piss in the morning. GF's family never lock the door. Saw my GF's moms tits. Traumatised.....

Edit 1: I showed my GF this TIFU. We've talked about this, and she had a sick laugh about it, although I absolutely did not find this funny. So, she read this TIFU, and she was like: ""Big hanging tits.... My mom's got beautiful tits for a woman at the age of 50. Especially when she breastfed me until I was three."" - IS THIS NORMAL? THREE YEARS?!.... I seriously don't know what to respond to her. 

Edit 2: This isn't unlikely. I searched the internet for it, and wow. Apparently this is normal (wtf). 
Although it's ""normal"", i must say I just read a comment about this dude's cousin who was breastfed until he was 7... This isn't normal. 7 fucking years? Holy shit! "
3e73f7,non_TBI,"First of all. I am sorry about my formatting. Complete newbie to Reddit. :(  
  
  
**Do not try this at work**: A lot of people commenting on how unprofessional my behaviour was at work and they are 100% right. That's why I posted this here. I have a very wild imagination and being sexually deprived and a huge fan of erotic fiction did not help my case at all. The reality of the situation was clear to me the second I arrived at work, but since I had gone that far I decided to go all the way.  My co-worker and I have a long history of crossing the line when it comes to flirting in the office. We are great friends and I hoped that we'd be something more after this... ooops.
  
A co-worker and I have been flirting something serious lately. We're both single and very attracted to each other so we have as much we possible can in our dead-time. We haven't taken things any further than that because we are both pretty busy in the evenings. I attend night-school he is a single dad, which makes him even hotter.
  
    
My TIFU begins with me trying do something a little naughty. No panties and dress that just barely covers my butt. I was a little nervous this morning and really had to hype myself up to do this so I was a little late to work. When I get to work, I see him sitting at his desk.  This guy sits at a desk directly opposite me. He smiles at me. I wink at him.  I sit down, spread my legs, and take a deep breath.  
    
  
I am about to send him a message on Facebook telling him to look under the desk... but this is when I hear the sound of a phone camera taking a snapshot. At first I think he's noticed and has sneakily taken a picture... so, I change my FB message to something like, ""what are you going to do with that picture ;o"" Right as I am about to hit send his 8 year old son stands up from the floor, hands him the phone, and says ""dad, look!""  
My heart skipped several beats, and I am too scared to stop myself from accidentally hitting the send button.  I hear the Facebook messenger sound. He looks at the phone and looks at me with the, ""what... the... hell..."" kind of look. 
  
  
At this point I am terrified and on the brink of tears. I quickly stand up not realizing that my dress isn't covering my nether, and I am not wearing any panties. The guys jaw drops. I tug my dress down... and make a run for the bathroom.  
 
     
I've been in here for 20 minutes. Crying my eyes out. Too scared to go out. I have no idea how many people saw this, or what's going to happen next. :(

  
**TL;DR**: I flashed my co-workers 8 year old son and he took a picture of it. Might also have flashed the entire office.  
  
  
**Update**: His son did not snap a picture of my crotch. Something *much worse* happened. The son was just on the floor playing with his dad's phone. Took a selfie of himself making a silly face.  I assumed this was my co-worker taken a sneaky picture under the desk. My FB message kind of suggest that he should ad the picture to his spank bank. That's why he was so weirded out. Unfortunately, though, his son did see my nether when I stood up in a hurry.  Apparently he said, ""dad, why is that lady not wearing any underpants"". Out so loud that the entire office pretty much heard it. :(  So, this is much, much worse.  
  
  
**Update**: Co-worker took me home to get changed (was too sad to feel sexy). On the way back I explain why I wasn't wearing any panties. He blushed but couldn't really give me a decent t reply except for, ""aww!"" It was sincere though.  
  
When I get back to work my boss approaches me and tells me to meet him in his office as soon as possible. I am about to get fired I think. :(  
  
  
**Update**: I spent a good amount of time trying to find the perfect excuse as to why I wasn't wearing any panties at work. From ""*I forgot to do my laundry*"" all the way to ""*didn't want to be late so I took the risk*"", but, as it turned out, I didn't any.  He began with asking how I was feeling.  He was concerned that the ordeal had caused me traumatic stress. When I told him I was fine he then got a pretty serious look in his face and started telling me that I was not dressed professionally and that I should be more considerate to my fellow employees before deciding on my attire next time.  He acknowledged the fact that I had already changed and said what I was wearing now was suitable.  I was sooo relieved. I honestly thought I was going to get fired, because honestly, I would have fired myself (but then again I knew what my intentions were, he didn't). Just as I was about to leave, he said, ""have you spoken to (the co-worker whose son I flashed)"" and I only told him the half-truth by telling him that we briefly spoke, and completely left out the fact that he is now aware of my intentions and that he drove me home to change. He told me that I should apologise to him in person and ask if his son is okay.  
  
  
I send a message to my co-worker asking if I could apologise to him in person after work by buying him a drink, or two, or ten and paying for any therapy his son may need now or in the future.  :P  
  
  
**Update**: We're meeting up for drinks. :D  
  
  
**Update:**: Drinks went REALLY well. He said his son was quick to forget, or at least he didn't mention it again for the rest of the day. My mini-dress was just bunched up above crotch level but I was quick to pull it down so my kitty wasn't on display for long at all. My co-worker said that he didn't notice anything and had no idea what his son was commenting on. But, with all honesty, I think he was just being polite.  He has invited me over for dinner at his place on Saturday evening, and I am really looking forward to it! :)  
  
  
As for the mini-dress. It wasn't too short. It covered all the right parts, but the problem is that it takes very little to ride all the way back, and since I stood up so quickly it just went right up there and I didn't notice. Provided picture below for reference of dress.  
  
  
[My mini dress went this low...](http://www.stripgear.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/2/2/221291_white_alt2_lg.jpg)"
2vzjba,non_TBI,"This happened about two days ago.
So, about 4 months ago I broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years, needless to say there was sex. Lots of sex (I have a really high sex drive, so.. that happened). The first month after our break up I was pretty down, it simply didn't work out and it bummed me out pretty badly. I didn't feel pretty or cute anymore (yes, I broke up with him... but it was still really difficult because of the circumstances. I still loved him) and didn't feel like masturbating at all (even when I was with him I would touch myself at least once a day honestly). The second month I was keeping myself busy - Yoga, volleyball, picnics, friends, gaming and just sort of didn't feel like it. I was still mourning. Same with the next two months.

So finally, I'm done with month 4 and I realize '... you haven't played with yourself in way too long' and I'm like 'lets do this'. So I buckle myself the fuck down in bed and I'm like 'k'. Mind you, I don't use a vibrator because I'm quite shy and I'm afraid of buying one in a store and buying one online requires a person to deliver it and I'd answer the door 100% red faced. I don't know... anyways. I should mention that my roommates parents were staying over. I think we all know where this is going. Kind of.
So there I am, fiddling my fadoodle and it's going great. However, I'm pretty loud (but she lives downstairs and I guess sometimes I underestimate how loud I can be...). So, I'm watching porn (and I'm pretty submissive, so my loudness includes me ... saying. Certain things. And calilng myself names, not sure why that helps me but in this situation it just... I should've shut up) and everythings jolly the sun is shining and my vaginas like 'I deserve this tbh'. Quality time.

So I'm at the peak of the god damn mountain, and I'm like 'NAH. EDGE'. So I edged. For a while. (MIND YOU, I THOUGHT MY ROOMMATES PARENTS WERE GONE... SINCE... THEY SAID THEY WERE LEAVING EARLIER). Finally I let myself finish and I'm flailing around a bit, quite loudly and my door opens. My roommates mother is staring at me with wide, regretful eyes and there I am attempting to get a hold on my orgasm... causing me to try covering myself while recovering. I hit my ankle on my wall super hard, fall off of my bed while doing so and land on my cat who was apparently under my bed until the door opened. This results in my darling cat flipping her shit, scratching me and running. So here I am on the ground, bleeding with an apparently broken ankle (yep, I hit it that hard), naked and recovering from orgasm.
My roommates mother is in between laughing and being very concerned. She literally closed the door... then opened it again to ask if I was hurt, to which I told her I was. She helped me to get dressed since my ankle was preventing me from doing so and then she drove me to the hospital.

**edit** : Okay, I will order a vibrator from amazon I swear guyz ims rry

3anv9l,non_TBI,"So I went to get my hair cut today, this time I wanted to go with something different I found a [hairstyle]( http://imgur.com/r9amiwS) I want to try. I pull out my phone and show my barber. My phone started to dim and get ready to lock, so I tapped the screen to have it not die. By tapping it I acidentally swiped left to the next [picture](http://imgur.com/iws17ph). To say the least, the rest of the haircut was a little awkward."
2p8ufo,non_TBI,"This wasn't from today, but a story from my youth that I've decided to share. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So, I was a horny 15 year old living with my parents. I had a fairly rigorous masturbation schedule (2/3 times per day) and I looked at all sorts of porn. Hentai, teens, creampies, everything on the popular porn sites. In general, I used a regular rotation of dirty laundry to catch as I was finishing, and this system worked pretty well until one fateful day when everything went awry.

I don't know what it was about that day, in particular, but I was hornier than a toad. I felt like I could've gone 10 times. Lo and behold, on that glorious saturday, I reached that mark (which, to this day, I have not bested). By the tenth time, very little was coming out, and I decided I was finished with finishing.

Here's the fuck up: I used the same old white t-shirt to catch every single time. The reason this was a fuck up: I could not, in good consciousness, put this wretched cloth in the laundry basket. Aside from the fact that it might dirty up the other laundry in vile ways, my mother might see it.

And so began me and that white shirt's fateful journey. For an entire year, I, an incredibly sexually depraved 15/16 year old, exclusively finished on old whitey 2/3 times per day. With every passing day, my shame grew, I was less inclined to put the shirt in the laundry, and the shirt became (apologies for the vulgarity) crustier and crustier. Seriously -- after about 6 months the thing was rigid as hell. It was more Frisbee than cloth. Whitey had absorbed mass and hardened, and was fully capable of bludgeoning a grown man to unconsciousness. If bent properly, I have no doubt it could've been used as a bowl. Absolutely. Fucking. Horrible.

Cut to a not-so-horny Saturday. I was playing video games on my xbox. I hear my mom coming down the stairs and into the family room, where I was.

""grosstimes! I have a question.""

""Okay, what---""

She was there. Whitey was there. In her hand.

""Do you know what happened to this shirt?""

At this point I'm literally struggling to contain my bowels. I had to think quickly.

""I think the cat peed on it. Just give it here I can deal with it.""

No such luck.

""Really?...""

And here, dear reddit, is the moment that ruined my life. She grabbed my 1-year old, 500+ cum load stained jizz receptacle and rubbed it against her face. And not just a little bit; she did so with a vigor seemingly unmatched by any olfactor in recent history. Time slowed down as I watched my 50-something mother place the entirety of her innocent, trusting face into my collective pubescent shame. Taking one big wiff, she looked me right in the eye, right into my 16 year old soul, and walked directly out of the room.

TL;DR: My mom stuck her face in my 1 year old dirty, crusty cum rag and we never spoke of it again.

EDIT: RIP my inbox. For the record, those of you who are saying this is fake, I can assure you, it's not. Why would my mom smell what she thought was a cat piss stained shirt? We used to have a cat that would pee on everything, so we had grown accustomed to smelling items to determine if they needed special cleaning attention."
2mdeoi,non_TBI,"This particular TIFU is a delayed action TIFU since it started this summer and exploded in my face yesterday.

I decided to join my sister for a few days of vacation in our family home. My sister had invited half a dozen of her college friends at the house, most of them being female (thanks vet school !). So we proceded to enjoy our vacations with a unholy quantity of food and alcohol. That’s where my fuckup began. My usual policy about dating is to stay away from potentialy complicated situations, which means lil sis’s friends are off limit. Due to drunkness and quite a bit of flirting, I end up with one of the girls (let’s call her Girl A). The next morning is a bit ackward since she explains to me that she has a boyfriend. Having been on the place of the boyfriend I’m not very happy but I agree that we should act as if nothing had happened. A couple days latter I hook up with Girl B, another of my sister’s friends. The situation is much more healthy : just two single adults looking for harmless fun for a few days. To avoid any drama we agree to keep it discreet and spend the rest of the vacations happily having fun and part in good terms. All in all, a nice holiday for me.

Fast forward to yesterday : my sister is now roomate with Girl A and Girl B and thus far everything was going well, they even adopted a kitty. I’ve nicely avoided every invitation to visit her new place and all is going well. Exept this weekend Girl A caught her boyfriend cheating on her. The ensuing shouting match ends up with her trying to get back at her BF by saying that she « screwed LilSis’s brother during the holidays ». At that point girl B, who was trying to calm the situation explode in laughing and adds that she too slept with me at the same moment. Girl A doesn’t take this well and redirects her anger on Girl B. The result is that the two of them do not want to live together anymore and my sister has to leave her appartment fast because it became to expensive for her.

I just spent the afternoon being insulted by my sister on the phone and my mother and grand mother just called me saying that I’m a « salaud » (yeah I’m french).

TL;DR : Fooled around with my sister’s friends, ended up creating a timebomb that forced her find a new appartment. Now considered a bad man by sister, mother and grandmother … :/

Edit : Because quite a lot of people don't seem to know what a ""salaud"" is (can't really blame them) here is the definition : ""Despicable man, that acts in disloyal manner"".

A small and final update : 

Things have calmed down a bit, my sister is still pissed at me (in her mind friends are off limits) but she managed to convince Girl B to stay and find a new roomate. The most important think is that THEY HAVE THE CUSTODY OF THE CAT ! 
I still need to convince the mom an grandma that me enjoying the perks of being a bachelor does not make me a bad person but they should get around it at some point ... 

And for those who wonder : I know that it's not my fault directly, but since I was not smart enough to keep it in my pants I'm partly responsible. Especially when someone else is paying the consequences.

PS : About the ""bragging"" part or the fact that it involves sexual bits. You have to realise that the fuckup potential of relationships (and by extension sex) is fucking high. I mean all the potential ackwardness, the feelings (expressed or not) makes it a endless source of potentially funny situations. Plus sex is goddamn common, talking about it because it's needed to is not bragging, it's just giving the fucking facts needed to understand the story ... Bragging is telling ""I've fucked 3 different girls yesterday"" without context (something i sadly couldn't do because I was too busy playing warlords of draenor all weekend). Peace out ! o/ 
"
2xmqe5,non_TBI,"So like most of these, this happened a few years ago. I was visiting a couple of female friends in a large Canadian city . One of these friends i had been sleeping with on a semi occasional basis, and it was fun but nothing serious. So this particular night we ended up at their friends place. The friends in question were renting a fitted basement in a fairly nice residential area. 
There was a lot of drinking and i had driven over and parked my car out on the street prior to drinking. I began to drink heavily and honestly don't even remember what the reason was (probably i had left smokes in my car) but I invited this girl to come fetch them with me as an excuse to get us alone. Once we got out to the car we started making out and realized there was no obvious place to continue but in the car itself. . . so we did. I put the back seats down and we got to it. . . and i'm talking GOT TO IT, up against the windows, very loud, and it was a small car so it was rocking.
Fast forwards twenty minutes and we had had our fun, composed ourselves and went inside. Upon re-entering we found many glum semi drunk faces. Apparently, five minutes earlier their landlord (who lived in the house above) had burst in and declared that they would be thrown out the next day, having had previous warnings, the couple having loud rampant sex in a car parked out on the street was the last straw.
So basically i got several guys kicked out of their apartment for sleeping with a girl in my car. . . My biggest fuck up to date!"
2a19o8,non_TBI,"I was at my girlfriends family home for the first time and no one was home, after a while of hanging out things starting getting a bit frisky between us, eventually i started finger bangin' her. This is where things got interesting. Half way through we hear someone coming up the stairs, so quickly I pull out of her while she slips her skirt back down . In walks her brother within a few seconds, her brother who i've never met to this point, he introduces himself and extends his hand to shake mine.

Rewind 3 months and i had a motocross accident, broke my arm and collarbone, both on the same side, my arms in a cast and a sling as well.

Fast forward. Im trapped, I had no option except to attempt to wipe his sisters juices off on my shorts before shaking his hand. After an awkward delay of a hand shake, with minimal juice extraction, I go for it, i shake his hand.

The most awkward moment of all our lives ensured. 

He felt it, looked at me like what the fuck, looked at his sister who was bright red.He knew, he definitely knew.


TLDR: Fingered dudes sister, shakes his hand with sticky fingers due to other arm being in a sling."
40mdzl,non_TBI,"Okay so this just happened. Big snow fall, rushing to get to work but have to shovel my half of the driveway. I rush into the shed to get a shovel (first time this year). It's dark. I reach to grab the shovel and WHAM, I step on the propped up rake and take the handle in the chin. I curse the rake, swear profusely and grab the shovel. I start to shovel, but realize I grabbed the one with the rusty metal blade at the end. Not right. I run back into the shed to grab the right one and WHAM, this time I take the handle in the teeth. Now drinking coffee hurts. Happy snowy Tuesday everyone..."
3wjvuj,non_TBI,"This was the most embarrassing moment of my damn life. Happened a few years ago, not today for those who really care.

So I go to my girlfriends house to help her with some shit for school. I bring my laptop over and we get to working on whatever it was. We were sitting in her kitchen with the rest of her family: her mom, dad, brother and her Grandmammy. Her Grandmammy is the fucking sweetest lady you ever met. Good Christian chick who wears a rosary around her neck and always saying things like ""God be good"" at random times that don't call for God's blessing. She just that thankful to the big guy. 

So it's getting late and everyone goes to bed. Parents and bro sleep upstairs, the Grandmammy sleep downstairs in a room that is right off from the kitchen. This is important to know! Anyways, me and my GF working on this shit and I get in the fucking zone. She bored as hell and don't want to do the work, so being the devil she is, she trying to distract me. She slides her hand up my shorts and starts playing with my manhood. Not one to deny a girl playing with my dick, I let her do her thing, but honest I was so into doing this work that I kept doing my own thing. Seeing as I wasn't going to budge from being a diligent student and doing this work (which was her own shit that I was doing nicely for her) she proceeds to unzip my fly. We all know what happens next. She down there sucking me good and I'm only human and get out of that zone to enjoy this. Thoroughly. 

Grandmammy must have been sitting in her room sensing a disturbance in the holy air. God must have warned her that some sinning was going on right outside her room and she wasn't about to have that. I don't really know, but what I *do* know is that I'm sitting in that chair enjoying the beautiful sensations of my girlfriends throat wrapped around my dick. That is until I look up and I realize I'm in a fucking stare down with Grandmammy. She starts yelling at the top of her damn voice 

**""I KNOW I AINT RAISED NO SLUTTY WHORE""**
**""WHATCHU THINK YOU DOIN""**
**""BOY GET THE FUCK UP OUTTA MY HOUSE""**

At least I assume that's what she said. I was so freaked out that in an attempt to run away and hide from the situation, I attempt to stand up. The thing is, this all happened so quickly that my girlfriend didn't have time to get off my dick. She still down there when I get up and that means I'm stuffing my dick further down her throat. Poor thing, that triggered her gag reflex and she gags and gets up and runs to the sink to throw up. So she over there throwing up and I'm standing up with my dick hanging out of my shorts with all hell being unleashed on me from Grandmammy. ""PUTCHO DICK AWAY"" is something that I know *for sure* that she said to me right there. So I hastily return my dick back in my shorts as GF's Dad come in the room to see what is going on. My first concern is to check on my girlfriend who puking but Lord knows I aint never touch her again with the eyes of Sauron on me. 

Grandmammy start yelling at GF dad telling him what she seen and how disgusted she is. Thankfully, Dad was more concerned about his daughter than beating my ass, so he checked on her. I go to see how she's doing and Grandmammy yelling at me to get away from her. Girlfriend looks at me to let me know she's ok and I give her a little head nod meaning that ""I gotta get the fuck out of here"" and she gets it.  I pack up my laptop, head for the door and get a clean smack on the back of my head from Grandmammy (deserved ma'am) and I head on home. 

My girlfriend and I broke up after that, but only to appease her family and avoid awkwardness. We still hung out quite a bit after that, but **never** at her house. Kinda sucked (ha!) it came to that, but we still good to this day. Grandmammy, however, passed away last night. As much as she hated me, she was a good woman. I'll miss that lady. RIP. 

TL;DR Got head from girlfriend, got caught by her grandmammy, all hell let loose.

Edit: Damn, this blew up. I made this comment a little earlier, but I figured I'd put it here in the OP. It's the aftermath, basically.

*After I left that night, Grandmammy was furious with her. Her parents were too, but they were more chill about it and they did typical parent shit and would make her do more chores or whatever. Grandmammy wasn't so easy to forgive. Eventually at some point, girlfriend sits down with Grandmammy and bawls her eyes out and they talk about it. I'm sure there was some sappy shit that they went over, but end point is that they made up and continued with a very close bond. They always had been incredibly close and this was just one of those coming of age moments.*

*Enough of girlfriend, I know you all just want to know about me. I saw Grandmammy around from time to time over the following years and I avoided her best I could. Even two or three years after that night, I still got that ""ohfuckohfuckohfuck"" feeling in my stomach whenever I saw her family. The awkwardness was just too painful.*

*For this next part, I need to get real for a second and it will help explain things. Growing up where I did, not a lot of people went to college or did much with their lives. I did make it out and I went to a pretty good university. Grandmammy knew this and I know she was proud of me for that. So in that sense, yes she made it up to me. In all other senses, she would have beat the shit out of me with a crowbar if it didn't mean eternal damnation for her.*

That last sentence is a joke. Calm yourself. Also, I think a lot of you are mistaking Grandmammy as some horrible prude who ruined our lives. Shut the fuck up. No, she didn't. Did she approve of it? No, she's an old religious lady. Of course she didn't. It is what it is. She didn't ruin the relationship between me and my girlfriend. As I mentioned before, we still hung out and are friends to this day. It's not like we were in a longterm serious relationship. Some of y'all need to get over yourselves and enjoy a laugh."
2kertg,non_TBI,"Throwaway account because I know he uses Reddit.

So this happened 4 hours after he wanted me to review his homework for errors and the like. After reviewing it, I placed it on my desk and next to my desktop but he forgot to pick it up and went to sleep, mother following shortly afterwards. 

I was the only one awake, and had time for me!

I opened up an incognito tab, went straight to Pornhub and the next thing I know I was flailing away. I went through three 9-11 minute videos before reaching my climax. Then it hits me.

I have no tissues.

I have nothing to release into or onto safely either, so I start literally scavenging through the stuff on my desk with my left hand. My hand touches something that resembles a paper among of the electronics and pencils. I barely had enough time to position it over my penis and block the cum train.

Guess what? The paper was my son's homework and I have no idea what to say to him when he wakes up.

So now there is a map of the USA with my cum all over it. 'Murica...?

TL; DR: Brought no tissues with me while masturbating. I improvised and used my son's homework instead.

40snjd,non_TBI,"Welp... This happened this morning and as you can expect, I'm waiting for a call into the HR office.

I was busy meeting with a vendor of ours in the conference room talking about some products we need to purchase when our mid-60's super sweet purchasing lady pops her head in the door and asks ""Hey Rated-M, do you have a sec when you are done in here to stop and see me?"" As I was deep in conversation with this vendor I answered in complete autopilot with my typical shit eating grin ""Sure Ann, I'm happy to give you all the secs you need as soon as I finish up here."" 

My brain then caught up to what I just said. She had a look of disgust on her face I couldn't describe if I tried as she stomped off back to her office. I turn back to the vendor I was meeting with to find him trying his best to hold back from laughing. Needless to say, the meeting ended there, and I haven't stopped at Ann's office yet.

TL;DR - Apparently I want to have lots of secs with sweet older purchasing lady

Update - So I got called to HR at 4:00pm today to have a discussion. The HR manager totally understood that it was a completely honest mistake, but mentioned that Ann doesn't see it that way. To make Ann happy I am getting sent to a workplace sensitivity training sometime next month. Better than getting fired I guess! (edited a second time to move update to the bottom)"
3r5x9j,non_TBI,"TIFU happened **a decade ago** before starting football at military academy. 

I was leaving the state in a month to play football, and I still hadn't gotten my physical done yet. This was back when physicals still included finger-to-ball cough-touching. I'd always found this part of playing sports to be particularly awkward. My very first physical as a child I was so worried about gagging on a tongue depresser that when the Dr. told me to turn my head and cough, with his finger up my nads, I looked to mother and worriedly asked, ""is he going to stick anything down my throat??""

So there I am at 18 years old at the doctor's office getting my pre-season physical. I knew that at some point it was coming, and I was going to have to pull them out in front of this nice old man. He had me lying on the exam table inspecting my thyroid area. He stepped away from the table and said, ""go ahead and nip your shorts down a bit for me."" I thought it weird because normally the hernia inspection was done while you're standing up. But nonetheless I pulled my shorts down to the middle of my quads and had it all out. He turned and came back to the examination table, and without saying anything he pressed on my lower abs checking for I don't know what. He then turned back to his desk and said, ""OK you're all good to go."" The cringe hit hard. He'd intended for me to expose my lower abs better, not whip out the rig. I pulled my shorts up, and sat up. I couldnt make eye contact with the guy, so I took the paperwork and left. The cringe set in so deep that I had trouble walking back to the waiting room with a normal stride. It shall hopefully forever remain the single most awkward moment of my life. I took seven cringe breaks writing this. "
25a5bb,non_TBI,"This actually happened a couple of days ago.

I am an engineering intern and was invited to go to a seminar with a bunch of other engineers from my company.  This required about a 4 hour road trip.  My smartphone was on the verge of going over my allotted 2 GB of data per month, with a few days to go until a new cycle, so I knew this was going to be a long boring trip with nothing to do.

About an hour into the trip, feeling bored, I jokingly announced, ""can someone set up a wifi hotspot with their phone, I've reached my data limit"".  The engineer sitting to the left of me said that he had problems with going over his data limit as well until last month when he changed some settings on his phone.  He asked me to open up my app settings to determine which applications were using the most data this past cycle.  This is where I fucked up.

I had forgotten that I had gone without wifi at home for a couple of weeks because fuck paying bills.  After a few days in without internet, I had not had any happy time, so I decided to look some stuff up on my phone.  However, my phone for some reason will not stream videos from porn sites.  I can stream youtube, liveleak and many others, but any porn site that I try to watch a video on, my phone tells me I can only download it.  Well, I did not want to download porn onto my phone, so I decided to find a pornviewing app and stumbled upon Pornhub.  I had heard a few days before on Reddit that Pornhub would plant a tree for every hundred videos watched, so I felt like I was doing some good in the world everytime I used this app.  Which was multiple times before I got my internet turned back on.  

So back to the van on our road trip, I bring up the list of apps that had used the most data the past cycle.  I should point out that I have a Galaxy Note 2, which has a very large screen.  To my surprise, because I had forgotten, right at the top of the list was a big Pornhub emblem and a green bar that said it had used about 1.2 GB of data.  Unfortunately for me, the engineer on my left, and the engineer on my right, and the chief engineer sitting behind me were all watching me while I did this.  To make matters worse, as soon as I realized what was at the top of the list, I tried to slide it off the screen to make it disappear, but in my nervousness, I ended up tapping on it which opened up a screen to give more details about the app, as well as enlarging the icon for all to see.  The engineer to my right started laughing, and wouldn't stop for about 10 minutes, the engineer to my left stated ""well this is awkward"".  And the chief engineer behind me would not make eye contact with me at all for the rest of the day.  I overheard the story being told multiple times during breaks in the seminar with the other 6 engineers on the trip, so now everyone in my office probably thinks I'm some sort of perv.  I am not looking forward to work tomorrow morning.


Edit:  Wow, this kind of exploded today.  Thanks for all the great responses.  I'm sure that Everyone will have a few good laughs at my expense tomorrow which I think I can handle.  I imagine all of the engineers in the office will be jealous as shit though when I tell them that [u/Katie_Pornhub](http://www.reddit.com/user/Katie_Pornhub)  responded to the thread.  That's almost like real life contact with a female.  We all know who I will be thinking about tonight when I arm wrestle with my one eyed vessel  (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞


tl;dr:  Showed a few engineers that I am interning for that the number 1 data using app on my phone is Pornhub :("
2s1gbb,non_TBI,"Well reddit, today I done fucked up. 
I work at a burger joint as a cook and have a pretty cool manager. By pretty cool manager I mean the guy fucks around with us a lot, we will have random slap fights, hide each others shit, spike co-workers drinks with sauces, just tomfoolery all around. Well today I decided I would take my managers phone and replace his wallpapers (which I have successfully done before) with me and other co-workers giving him the finger while he went to grab a smoke, but this time it was.. not a good time to say the least. As I snapped the first picture and brought up the photo album to set a wall paper I saw his ""recent photos"". This is when I was greeted with a 21 gun salute of dick pic's. God I dont think Ill ever manage to burn those images out of my mind. And believe me, its hard to keep a straight face talking to the guy when those images pop up in your mind.

2w23zz,non_TBI,"So this just happend and apparently I am single now. My gf randomly calls me and ask me if on my birthday i wanna have a threesome with her and her female friend.  I obviously suspecting it to be a trick question said no and i genuinely didn't care about threesome as I don't want to cheat on my girl. She kept pushing me and sending me her friend's pictures and saying how we should be trying new things and it will be fun. At that point I thought maybe that's something she wants to try and after a good 30 mins of persuasion I agreed to it. She hung up on me after and texted me saying it's over and that she was just testing me. I feel like an ass now. 

EDIT: Thanks for the comments and support guys, I really appreciate it.  I just woke up and saw 7 missed calls from her.  Got her text saying ""If you ever loved me, pick up the phone"".

26g30h,non_TBI,"Throwaway because my other roommate knows my reddit account.

Let me start off by saying I'm a dude living with two other dudes. They're really cool and outgoing, but i'm kind of on the shy side. Likewise, I'm a very shy masturbator and even kind of prudish. I only masturbate in the bathroom (we only have one in our 3-br apartment), in the dark and at hours when everyone is asleep.

So, it was ~3am last night and I was browsing gonewildplus on my phone. I removed my pants and went to town. It's important to note that I sleep without a shirt, so by removing my pants, I was left in my birthday suit. I just like the freedom of being nude. There are no windows in our bathroom, so the only light source at the time was my phone.

I was on the verge of cumming when my phone screen shut off. Being that I was too into the moment, I didn't have time/motivation to pause and unlock my phone to get the imgur album back. Just 20 seconds before I came, my roommate walked in to take a leak. Keep in mind it was completely dark in the room. We've all lived there for so long that we have adapted to feeling the rug in front of our toilet by walking on it to navigate our way through. Being that it is directly in front of the door and my legs were wide apart, my roommate was able to walk right in front of it didn't notice I was there. I was caught like a deer in the headlights; I just couldn't move or say anything.

Then, the worst fucking thing that could ever happen at that moment: just as my roommate began urinating on me, I came. So here I am, holding my dong pumping cum like a frosting dispenser, while my roommate pees on me. Noticing there was a lack of peeing noise, he yells ""the fuck is that"" only to turn on the lights to reveal his naked, piss-soaked roommate. He just stared at me for five agonizing seconds, zipped up and left.

It's 10:30AM and I haven't slept and still haven't come out of my room. My roommate probably thinks I got off to him pissing on me. I don't know what my roommate has done or where he is but I fear the worst. I have to move. I can't stay here. I don't know what to do.

Edit: yes we have a lock, but it sticks. I never use it because I'm afraid of being locked in.

Edit 2: I went to the kitchen to get some food. My non-pissing roommate, sitting on the couch, looked at me briefly and looked away without saying anything. He knows. I'm eating in my room. Fuck."
2hos2j,non_TBI,"This is long but worth it, I promise. Like most TIFU, this didn't happen today. This happened three days ago. 

So, I'm a 23 year old male, living in Phnom Penh, speak very little Khmer but learning. I'm very straight. 

Having recently arrived in Phnom Penh, I still live at a hostel (though I get my apartment tomorrow!) with a bunch of other westerners on holiday, so naturally once the sun sets, the party gets started. I'm drinking with some New Zealand army guys, and couple of English girls, so drinking properly. Our hostel closes its bar around 11pm, so we decide to head out to a second bar. 

More drinking and some nitrous balloons, we all take a tuk tuk out to a dance club called Pontoon. Now, this is a popular spot for locals and Westerners and more than a few of the local women are hookers. I buy an overpriced beer for $3 and head to the dance floor where we make fools of ourselves. After about twenty minutes, a Cambodian woman comes up and offers me a drink which I accept (mistake 1). I guzzle it down, we dance for a few minutes, and when the song ends I realize I need to sit down.

Barely after I sit in the chair, I'm surrounded by four Khmer bouncers. They're yelling at me in Khmer, which I do not understand, though finally one of the smaller ones starts saying in broken English ""come with me, you no pay drink, why you no pay drink, you steal from us"" etc. They're surrounding me, and I'm starting to get a bit belligerent. I didn't order shit, I was offered it. I only have about 1000 real on me (25 cents) so I couldn't pay for it even if I wanted too, but they start leading me toward the back of the room. Thankfully, one of the army guys notices and intervenes, pays for the drink, and the bouncers head off.

At this point I am pissed, and I have enough of a temper sober that I decide the best idea is head out of the bar and find my way back to the hostel. (mistake 2)

I head outside, and one of the bouncers says something, at which point a French guy comes up to me and gets in my face, saying something to the effect of ""Who do you think you are, coming here and disrespecting these people in their own country, how dare you"" etc etc. He's about four inches taller than me, but I have about twenty pounds on him and a belly full of courage so I stare back at him without missing a beat, and after a few awkward seconds he turns around muttering about arrogant yankees. 

At this point, I've completely forgotten that I have no idea where Pontoon Bar is, and storm off down a random street (mistake 3) (ironically, yesterday stumbled upon Pontoon while staying at another hostel - I was only a block off an area I know very well, and had I been somewhat more sensible, I would have realized that I recognized the street I was on because a landmark just beyond the club.

After a few blocks, a guy in a tuk tuk comes up to me and asks if I want a ride home. I want to cool my head and sober up a bit, so I decline (mistake 4) but ask if Independence Monument is in the direction I'm heading in and he confirms that it is. So I head off. 

Now, after about forty five minutes of walking, it's 4.30 in the morning, and I realize I have absolutely no fucking idea where I am. The city around me is also starting to get a bit grimy, with run down buildings, more than the usual amount of trash everywhere, and dead silent streets. I don't have any cash on me, but I do have my iphone, so I decide that I need to remove myself from this situation as quickly as possible. I notice a lit restaurant two blocks away and figure it hell, maybe somebody there speaks English and I can at least figure out where I am. 

When I'm maybe a dozen steps from the restaurant, a woman I hadn't seen comes out of the alley near it, and starts walking up to me. She immediately grabs my crotch and begins loudly saying ""massage, sex?"" I decide that the best possible course of action to immediately end this is to loudly announce that sorry, I'm gay, and I'm not interested. Mistake fucking 5. 

I walk into the restaurant, and a table motions to me to come to them. It's a man, about forty, and a lady boy, about 28. They start telling me in English to sit with them, and its pretty damn good English and beggars can't be choosers so I sit down. They offer me a can of beer, which I open and drink with them, and tell them about my adventure thus far. They tell me I went in the opposite direction and that I'm about ten kilometers from my hostel. Whatever, they're being very friendly, and then one of them says ""you know, you don't look or sound gay at all"" and suddenly it strikes me that they heard that I'm gay, and they're gay too and that I am flirting with a gay guy and a crossdresser in a random part of Phnom Penh, far away from anything I recognize.

Somehow it comes up that the older man owns a moto - and this is mistake 6 - and I come up with the brilliant idea - him. this is it. this is how I get home. put your game face on, you're gonna flirt with this guy and he's going to take you home and you will be fine. I do it. I'm friendly, laughing at his jokes, looking him in the eye, smiling, and finally I ask him - hey, can you do me a favor, I'm a bit drunk, would you be willing to take me home.

He agrees. Oh god yes. I hop on the bike and we're off. 

It's fine for about two kilometers. I don't want to get left on a corner so I'm still selling this. I'm also drunk and not making great decisions. I have one hand around his waist, resting on his thigh, the other one over his shoulder, and we're going. We're still driving when he starts fondling my crotch. Whatever. i must get home. Fondle my soft dick if thats what you want. Mistake 7. 

So there I am, thinking to myself, OK this is weird, but hey, I'm recognizing the streets, and look the sun is coming up and OH GOD WHAT

And that's when I have a moment of clarity and find myself, in Phnom Penh, drunk and lost at 5.30 in the morning, a romantic fuckin sunrise, on a moving motobike and this random Cambodian man's fat fucking tongue halfway down my throat going to town on my tonsils. 

OK. I asked for it. This is strange but whatever, I'm nearly home, and I can go scrub my mouth, and go to bed and all will be right with the world and hey, maybe I'll even black out and forget the whole night ever happen. He seems disappointed when he drops me off and I mutter a quick thanks and scurry off to bed and that's the end of the story.

I thought.

It turns out I MADE ONE FINAL AND HUGE mistake which I do not remember making. While flirting with the guy, somehow, for some reason, I decided it would really sell the ""I'm gay"" thing if I gave him my cell number.

I wake up in the morning to three texts, all variations of ""hey how are you, hey want some fuck, hey lets have sex"" and so on. I keep receiving them over the day, and that evening he calls me twice asking me what I'm up too. I quickly mutter a sorry and block his number and I'm thinking thats the end of it.

Next day - new number, same story. I block it.

guys its been three days. They wont stop. He's still texting.

The worst part of all this though? I forgot the fucking iphone in my fucking pocket has fucking 3G and I coulda just used that fucking map "
3p7027,non_TBI,"Obligitory ""This was a few years ago"". 

It's as bad as it sounds.

So I was in 8th grade, bored as fuck in science class. I had just finished watching Deathnote about a week ago, so it was constantly on my mind, thinking about how Neir's kinda dumb and such. Then I had a great idea. I pulled out a sheet of paper and wrote ""Deathnote"" on the header, trying to make it look as close to the shows logo as possible. I started my hitlist by putting down names of cartoon/fictional characters, Harry Potter, Duckhunt dog, Waluigi, etc. Then I took it up a notch, and started writing down the mascots for various food stuffs, Captain Crunch, Planters Peanuts Guy, etc. Then I took it up another step, and started wring down actual peoples names, Ex: Chad, Duncan, Louis. Then I wrote down some teachers names, and you get the point by now. So at this point the list was about 3/4 filled up, and I was admiring my piece of incriminating evidence. The day goes by and it slips out of my mind. The Last class starts and then I realize I don't have the paper. NBD, They'll just see the 25 fictional names and realize that the whole things a joke when/if anyone finds it.

And then the front office calls me up.

ohshit.jpeg

I walk up and the principle sits me down and very calmly talks to me about the situation he's been dealing with for the day. Someone had took my ""hitlist"" and given it to the office and told them it was mine (it didn't have my name on it). Principle asks me if the paper is mine. I, being the paragon of organic intelligence, admitted to writing a note containing at least 7 terroristic threats.

And it just so happened that this entire incident took place a week after the Sandy Hook shootings. all things considered, I was in a pretty bad situation.

Everyone that was on the list had to be taken into the office to be informed of the situation. Now. their were like 4 people who I was actually friends with on the list, compared to the 7 or so who I had no affiliation with. One of those friends, we'll call him Andy, told me he was forced to sign a form that said he felt his life was threatened. Idk if that happened, but that's what he told me. He also told me he laughed when the principle showed him the list. 

I got suspended for a few weeks, and had to write apologies to everyone on the list. I probably would have went to jail, if my dad didn't have a great lawyer friend who could help me. And to this day, I'm known in my school as ""The guy who tried to kill Captain Crunch"".

TL:DR- I was not meant to be Kira

EDIT1: My most biggest post is my biggest fuck up. Yay?

EDIT2: Why Captain Crunch needs to die, he was gunning for Count Chocula- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxKSnrUstDE

2iepk7,non_TBI,"I'm now happily in Singapore staying with my uncle for 10 days as planned, and this story happened (unlike so many TIFUs) earlier today for me, discounting the changes in timezone. Just to get this out of the way, I am a woman in my early 20s and I don't travel very often. I don't have that much money due to university / housing fees, so when I do travel, it's a pretty big deal for me!

I live in New Zealand, and the town I live in doesn't have an international airport. In fact, the airport where I live is insanely small, it has one building and no customs (only domestic travel from here, so no reason to). This means that I happily made it all the way to Auckland (the international airport) with my buttplug in.

Now, this is no cheap-ass butt plug. I *really* splashed out on this one. It's made of steel and is incredibly cold if you don't warm it up before you put it in. The best part? It's battery powered, and vibrates on command of a small remote. You may be asking yourself; ""Why has /u/WILL_SEND_NUDES inserted a butt plug in and so easily forgotten about it? I'm calling bs!"" Well, theres a perfectly reasonable answer, my skeptical friend. Usually when I wake up in the mornings I will have my own private sexy-time, which includes inserting (and usually removing) my expensive fucking buttplug.

Great, now that's out of the way, the interesting part.

As I approached the front of the line to go through security screening, I shoved my hands in my pockets in search of anything metal, like my keys and wallet. I searched through all my pockets, eventually coming across a small plastic rectangle. Now this in itself was no issue, other than the fact that it was the remote for my buttplug. Hm, that's odd, I must've accidentally put it in my- oh fuck. Realisation hit me like an abusive father.

My metal buttplug was still in my ass.

Two meters in front of me was a metal detector.

I couldn't just stand right there in the queue and pull out my buttplug, could I? There were no toilets around, so I couldn't just saunter off to one of those, and it was then I completely zoned.

I started sweating, I swear in my first day here in 34°-celsius-Singapore I haven't sweat as much as I did just then. I started looking around and *fucking panicked*. People were moving closer to the front of the line and a Maori airport officer guy was stacking trays and the girl in front of me moved through the metal detector and everyone was suddenly watching me and the security guard tilted his head slightly and my carry-on was suddenly so heavy and- ""Are you okay there miss?""

I can't remember what I said exactly, but I must've looked like complete shit. I made up some story about feeling really unwell and the security guard that tilted her head - the one that asked if I was okay - clearly didn't believe me. ""Miss, I saw you a moment ago and you were completely fine, would you mind coming with me?""

This kinda strikes me as odd, looking back at it. Don't people get nervous going through security anyway? Don't people that are scared of flying suddenly get hit by a wave of nervousness when they realise they're going to be on a plane? I mean, there are tonnes of viable reasons why I might have suddenly become distraught. I am not white, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but I found myself in this weird security screening room soon after.

This lady drilled me as to where I was from, where I was going, who I would be staying with, where they were from, my connection to them, if I was stopping over or finishing my journey in Sydney... This went on for what seemed like forever when I started crying. I'm a pussy, whenever I get stressed, I cry. It's something that is probably a form of defence mechanism, but it's usually more harm than help. 

In this case, it helped... I suppose :/

The lady instantly softened up, she came over to my side of the table and knelt down. She asked me, in the complete opposite tone of 10 seconds ago, what was really wrong. And through my puffy tear soaked cheeks, with snot dribbling out my nose, through heaped breaths and shaking hands (as you can tell I'm an incredibly attractive cryer) I told her. It went something like this - just imagine me starting every word 3 or 4 times before finishing it, stammering every syllable, and a gasping breath between each word.

""I-I-I (Heavy breath) L-L-Left my... (Sob)  I PUT IT IN AND... (Heavy breath) F-F-Forgooooot (Sad face)""

""Forgot what, sweetie?""

""(Incredibly sad face) (Heavy breath) B-B-Buttpluuuug (SUPER sad face) (Extra tears)""

Her face I'll never forget. She clearly wasn't expecting that answer. She probably thought I was confessing to putting a bomb in my carry-on or something like that. Her face twisted from shock, to disgust, to a kind of forced understanding look. She directed my to one of those large toilets, the disabled ones, so I could ""get rid of it"", which I did. They gave me a plastic bag to wrap it in, and actually let me keep it. Although it did have to go through the x-ray machine, which was fucking embarrassing, again. The buttplug managed to go unnoticed all the way here, and for that, I am grateful - although I'm pretty sure I noticed the xray machine guys at Sydney's transfer customs sniggering at my carry-on.

This was probably one of the most traumatising, stressful, and embarrassing experiences of my entire life. Sorry for the incredibly long read, but I just started writing this and got a on a roll, so. I hope you enjoyed my hellish fucking buttplug misadventure.

I have been doing this for several years now, and my students know that if they act out, they are telling me that they think that correcting their behavior is more important than educating themselves. So I give them busy work that is due the next school day and it must be signed by a parent. 

This brings us to 2nd period. Had a young lady decide that she wanted to cuss out her friend in the middle of class. I hand her this sentence, she rolls her eyes, but nods her head and puts it in her back pack. 

I just got off the phone with her mother. The conversation went something like this:

""Why the fuck is MY baby girl doing extra homework? She didn't do no nothin' to you.""

""She broke my class rules. She knows what she did, and she suffers the consequences.""

""But that don't give you the RIGHT to call my baby stupid. My baby ain't doin' your stupid homework bullshit either. Just you wait til I talk to your principal and the school board see how fast your fat ass gets fired.""

::pause::

""First, I never called her stupid. Her intelligence was never even a topic of conversation between us. And second, you're going to stop talking to me in the manner that you are. I do not accept that from my students, nor do I accept it from their parents.""

""There you go treating ME like I'm stupid now to tryin' to confuse me. You a asshole, that what you is. And I ain't taking this shit.""

""Now just a minute. You need to explain to me how you think I am treating you like you are stupid because I am completely lost.""

""You is talkin' all uppity.""

""I'm sorry...how?""

""You is all talk in' like you some know-it-all science bitch using all them big words and making my baby feel stupid because she has to write them she don't even know what they mean, I don't even know what they mean! You some uppity bitch ain't cha?""

""I'm still lost. What big words?""

""Fuck it, I a talk to your principal."" ::click::

She got confused by the words I used, thought I was maliciously and intentionally talking that way to make her feel stupid. She indeed, called my principal. A formal reprimand may take place tomorrow. Because I used big words. And assigned homework.

Update part 3:

Get a call from principal when I arrived at work to come to her office. Mom & child are in there. Principal has an odd look on her face. (and for all of you who were wondering... mom was white. Not that it even matters). I sit down, and before or the principal can say a word, child looks at mom, mom apologizes. She goes in to how she was having a bad day *insert health problems here* and that she didn't understand the situation so she naturally assumed I was picking on her child.

Principal keeps composed until they leave, then lost it. She laughed so hard she was crying. Apparently, they had a conversation over the phone the night before and she defined all the words for mom. Child was fine. She was willing to accept the lines and all was well.

Oh! And I checked, where I'm at, extra homework/writing lines/etc is NOT corporal punishment. I'm good. 

Edit 4: thanks for the gold, somebody! "
2a8qcd,non_TBI,"I was at Disneyland Paris with a group of friends. We were on that ride where you all stand in a room/spaceship whilst it gets pummelled with asteroids. The room shakes, sparks fly and flames pop up. People are fighting for balance and grabbing hold of things.

At one point all the lights went out. Everyone screamed and it was pitch black. I reached out to grab a railing, but recoiled when my knuckles connected with something unexpectedly soft.

When the lights came back on I saw a young child was standing close by, face red and drenched with tears. His father tried to console him as he wailed in terror.

Upon realising I'd just punched an eight year old in the face, I slowly turned and edged away. "
2zujlq,non_TBI,"So its a Friday night and being the anti-social college student, I decided to go to the library to get some studying in, which actually turned into how long could I stare at the same picture of a dog on /r/aww. After a couple of hours of looking at my phone waiting for something to happen, I got a text from a girl. Now, this girl was very sweet and very pretty and had the kind of innocence that magically makes you fall in love with her. She had been my best friend since middle school and we never tried to make moves because I couldn't hold a relationship for shit and seeing as we both are kind of nerdy, we didn't know what the hell to do. 

So back to the text, she asks me if I want to come over and watch Netflix. This was huge for me, since I have never used Netflix before since I am a baller on a budget, so I of course said yes, thinking that this Doctor Who loving girl just wanted to help a friend out with some quality entertainment. So, I make my way over to her room and noticed the door was open, walked in and there she is standing naked right in front of me. 

Now, if you see a girl just standing in front of you naked, you kind of have that pause moment when you go through the ultimate high of excitement, busting out into the Carlton dance, to the utter fear of not knowing what to do. So, being the smooth talking nerd that I am, I said this : ""So, No Netflix?"" And I got kicked the fuck out. 

An update to when I had originally posted this 3-4 weeks ago, the girl and I are still friends. I found out that the door was locked but college dorms suck and the door cracked open without her knowing. She was changing into her pajamas to watch the movie and didn't think that I had the speed of Usain Bolt. 

Edit: To all of the people asking about if she had intentionally left the door cracked for he to see me naked, I can 100% confirm it was not intentionally. The doors at this college that I got to have the ability to self open because of wind from another open door (Science). 

I also didn't make a move because sexy time just isn't the thing for me right now, just because I had a friend in high school who knocked up a girl because she legitimately poked holes into his condom on prom night. "
2tuitf,non_TBI,"My teenage daughter has a nasty habit of eating my cookies. She knows they’re my special cookies but she doesn’t care. If she finds where I hide them, she eats them.
The other day I went to my special cookie hiding place and found that, yet again, she had eaten them. I went up to her room in the vain hope that she might have left me perhaps one but sadly, no. What I did find in her room though was a bottle of vodka, obviously bought in preparation for her going out later that night. Ha! I thought to myself.. Steal my cookies will ya? Right, two can play at that game. So I emptied the contents of the bottle into an empty bottle I had and replaced it with water and screwed the top back on tightly and slipped it back into her bag. I chuckled to myself at the thought of the disappointment that she and her friends would be experiencing in a few short hours. That evening, I waited for her call but there was not a peep. The next day, when she came back, I asked her how her evening had gone. “Oh,” she replied, “it was weird… we had some vodka but when we drank it, it was water!” Grinning to myself but giving her my very serious dad’s face, I asked what they had done. “Well,” she said, “we just took it back to Tescos and they replaced it with a new bottle for us!” WTF Tescos?? A bunch of teenagers come in with a bottle of water and you replace that with a bottle of vodka?? FFS.. Teenage daughter – 1, Dad - 0
And to add insult to injury, a few days later, this letter arrives from Tescos : http://i.imgur.com/1hnFPgo.jpg

Edit: Since everyone's clamouring to know WHAT KIND of cookies they were and many have clearly got confused into thinking they were THAT kind of special cookie, here ya go, in all their King of Biscuits glory : https://www.sahadifinefoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/14222-960x720.jpg

Edit 2: Wow.. have woken up to my first ever gold. Thank you very much! I'm not entirely sure what that actually means yet but once I've finished my coffee I'll look into it.

Edit 3: I feel like I should address the cookie vs biscuit issue as this is getting a lot of comments. Yes, I'm British and of course these are biscuits but I spent about a third of my life living in Japan, where they're called cookies and in all honesty, the two words are interchangeable in my head and I use both quite happily. mmmm...biskies!"
3a8bhv,non_TBI,"Yesterday my girlfriend and I decided to get out of town for a while and take our dog, Dexter, to the beach. We looked up a beach that allowed dogs off leash and headed out. 

After an hour of running around in the sun sniffing butts and digging holes, we could tell Dexter was getting too hot. Unfortunately, he is a big baby and is really afraid of the ocean unless someone is carrying him. So my girlfriend picked him up and we walk into the ocean. We get in about waist high, Dexter doggy paddling and looking freaked out by the waves. We stay in for about 5 minutes splashing around and finally my girlfriend says ""hey let's head in. I think Dexter needs a break"" and I say ""let's just go a little further!"" and start stepping a little deeper. 10 seconds later I feel something slippery under my foot that I assumed was a plastic bag. One more step and I feel a sharp pain in the bottom of my foot. 
I yelp in pain and say I stepped on a nail and that I think it went deep into my foot. Once back on the shore, we clean out the small cut with water. By now, the pain has become so intense that I'm literally shaking all over. I figure I must have hit a nerve. I hate going to the doctor, but the pain keeps getting worse and my girlfriend insists. We find an urgent care and she waits in the care while I go inside. After the most unbelievably painful half hour wait, the doctor finally gets into the room, takes one look at my foot and tells me that I've been stung by a stingray. He prescribes me antibiotics, steroids, and pain medicine and sends me on my way.  

So here I am, high as shit on pain killers and stuck in bed for a few days, all because I didn't listen to my girlfriend. 

Don't get stung by a stingray. It's easily the most painful this I've ever experienced, and I've had some pretty serious surgeries with rough recoveries. 


TL;DR 
Went into the ocean with girlfriend. She wants to head in. I say no and seconds later get stung by a stingray. Experience worst pain of my life. Now I'm stuck in bed for a few days.

Edit: here's a picture of my foot today.

2vkh4c,non_TBI,"This happened last Valentine's Day. Deal with it.

Now I'm a chivalrous fella who believes in loving a woman every day of the year so I always played off Valentine's as the consumerist BS that it really is. Still, deep down I could see my girlfriend was into it and wanted something to mark the day.

So I ordered some flowers with a card to be delivered on the morning and booked a table at an awesome little restaurant. On the card I simply asked for ""From ?"" to be written, going along with the idea that I wasn't interested in Valentine's Day so it couldn't possibly be from me. This is where I fucked up.

When the package arrived and I playfully asked ""Wonder who those could be from?"" I did not expect to be met with the response, ""Probably Steven from work."" Who the fuck is Steven from work?!

Echoing that thought, I said, ""No they're from me. Who the fuck is Steven from work?!""

My girlfriend explained Steven from work had been hitting on her for about 4 months and recently asked what her favourite flowers were (lilies - like I had ordered).

We spent the rest of the day going through Steven from work's attempts to pick up my girlfriend, had an uncomfortable meal at the restaurant then returned home to find a Valentine's card had been popped through our letter box.

It didn't say who it was from.

**TL;DR Put your name on Valentine's cards to your girlfriend or she'll think it's Steven from work.**

EDIT: Since this went waaaay bigger than I expected (did it make front page? I was asleep) and a couple of people have asked, I thought I should clarify that girlfriend and I are sadly no longer together, though we are on speaking terms and catch up every now and then. The funny thing is Steven from work is taking the hit but she is now seeing Rob from work. Fuck Rob from work."

2j9n7a,non_TBI,"This is my throwaway account for obviously reasons. Today I had the biggest presentation of the semester (college) in my Cancer Biology class... I'm a big fan of going the extra mile so I decided to make a Prezi instead of the typical PowerPoint. Big Mistake. I hook my computer up to the projector and I'm online loading my Prezi. Right before I started I noticed I had some extra tabs open. One happened to be my Reddit NSFW gifs tab. I go to click the god forsaken microscopic 'X' by the tab but I clicked the tab body by accident. Simultaneously my teacher remotely switches the projector and the entire lecture hall (80+ students) gets a nice freeze frame of a huge Gianna Micheals facial. Not only was this the most embarrassing event of my life but the head of the biology department was there doing a teacher assessment. Goodbye letter of recommendation. Cancer Sucks. 

*Update 1: Wow so much response! Sorry everyone I did realize that it was not deepthroating but actually tittyfucking... I bet you guys still won't be disappointed ;) The link was http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw_gifs/search?q=gianna+micheals&count=26&before=t3_qgt2t

*Update 2: Thanks for all the positive reviews. I actually nailed the presentation after the incident! The initial laughing was silenced by some good old biology 


**Update 3: I would like to formally thank Gianna Michaels, because I know all you dirty birds clicked the link for her! Gianna if you're reading this, email me hahhahah "
35aiwa,non_TBI,"The other day my girlfriend and I were having a rather raunchy discussion to which ended with me saying I'd get her a dildo, to cut a long story short. As a sweet and ""romantic"" gesture I ordered a kit to make a dildo using my own penis, 'this'll go down a treat' my excitable mind tells me (so will she, hehe) as I splash 40 fucking pounds in this awesome piece of kit.


Fast forward to today, the incident of the fuck up. The package arrives and I'm excited to get to work on my penis sculpting. I rip open the parcel and see 4 simple steps:

1. Make your penis erect. (Pfft, easy)

2. Add the 3D gel and wait a few minutes. (Okay, so my dick is in a tube. Sounds simple enough)

3. Fill the mold with the skin feel silicone rubber. (The hard part must be over.)

4. Now you have an exact silicone copy of your penis. (not even a step. This will be a walk in the park.)


I open the product and pull out a sheet with 16 steps and meticulous detail along with precise timing ('Fuck...'). Along with this spills out a number of contraptions and such, so not just a tube and some gel ('Shit...').


Well, best get started. Firstly, I need to get erect, so I put on porn. Up the little guy stands, great start. Tie a ring around your penis to hold the tube in place; fuck up #1, much like a drawstring this thing tightens and nips the skin. Ouch.

Add water to powder and make a paste, but be quick if hardens fast. Pour it into the tube with my little guy. Little. Maintaining an erection with all this instruction following is difficult. 


Done. Not to a great standard but done. My masculinity is no longer needed. *pat on the head well done*.


Remove the gel with your hollow penis shape inside. Mix the silicone rubber  paste with the hardening solution. Okay! Oh, poop, a few bits splashed out round the kitchen, I'll have to deal with them later as I don't have much time. I pour the mixture into my hollow frame and would you believe it? The shell basically splits, pops and spills all over my kitchen counter. Noooo! £40 down the drain, no dildo and silicone rubber all over slowly hardening. In my urgent state I run and pick up the dish cloth and begin scrubbing. This stuff is a bitch to get up. I need to use a knife to scrape it off. I've got as much of it as I can and finish off with a wire brush and wire scrubber, but not nearly all of it has gone. I put the knife, the dish cloth and the wire scrubs in the sink to clean them. When I empty the water it appears that silicone does not mix with water, rather it sticks to the surface of whatever container it is in.


I attempt to rid the remnants of hard, dried silicone rubber but it's all over my hands and soap just won't budge it, another fuck up: I didn't wear gloves.


So I have now spent the day with the remains of silicone rubber on my hands as I went for my appointment at the bank, and a good portion of my kitchen and some of its utensils will not be rid of it. How do I explain this to my mother?


Tl;Dr: DIY dildo becomes dickish crime scene."
3tvwu9,non_TBI,"So I've had my dog in training for about 9 weeks. The first seven were ok. Standard sit, stay, lay down- whatever commands. 

So each session is 7 weeks. I was wondering why the ""intermediate"" training was called ""novice 1"" but I never bothered to ask. They'd have him sit on an elevated box...I thought ""oh cool! He learns how to sit on a scale properly for the vet office."" Second training session is really paying off!

Other things too. The trainers would have me do""figure eights"" with my dog around two other dogs and I figured it was a way to train him to ""leave it."" Also the head trainer kept telling me I should repeat the first level. ""Why??""

The trainers are super strict. They yell at me when my dog lays down in the sit-stay position and force me to prop him back up. Ok, they're super dedicated. Why does it matter? He's still staying! They want me to correct his sit position because he sits kind of crooked. Ok.

Today I'm doing figure eights with the head trainer and I/ my dog do something that's not up to par and the trainer comes to yell at me (as usual). 

""Get your dogs nose up!!! In competition this would never fly!!!""

In competition this will never fly.

In competition. 

I've been training my mutt for competition for 9 weeks.

this is why the trainers are so hard core.

this is why everyone was so curious to what his breed is.

they think I'm taking my rotten scoundrel to competition. 

Tldr: my ""training"" class for my dog is actually a competition course and it took me 9 weeks to realize it.

2bhd4j,non_TBI,"Very recently, I was travelling in Wales with my girlfriend, her sister and her sister's 2 young daughters, aged 10 and 6. We were driving around on a very hot day, in a stuffy, cramped car. I was sitting in the back, next to the 6 year old in the middle, and the 10 year old on the other side, while my girlfriend was in the front passenger side, and her sister was driving. 

We were about an hour into the drive and I was feeling a bit unwell. My stomach was churning and I was feeling light headed. Also the music on in the car was a Disney CD, on repeat. It was like one of Dante's circles of hell. My gf's nieces were squealing with delight at the horrendous music being played on repeat, and I was losing the will to live. Also I couldn't put the windows down, as these brats kept complaining that they were too cold, so the car was unbearably hot.

I became aware of the strong urge to fart, but because of the close quarters in the stuffy car, I didn't want everyone choking on my personal bum brew. So I held it in as long as I could, also I wasn't sure just how safe it would be.

After a while this became unbearable. I waited to see if we were going to stop soon, but it didn't look like it, so I had no choice but to let it out as discretely as I could. So I leaned forward a little bit, and I felt the warm gush of air silently bubbling out of me. It lasted for almost a full minute, my gf's sister picked up on it while it was still in progress. 

It smelt terrible. It was even viler than I thought it would be, you could taste the richness of it on your tongue, you could feel it overwhelming your palate. My gf's sister asked, 'who was that?' There was no answer. Both girls in the back were silent. Because it was lingering so long, she assumed it was more than a fart. 'Did either of you have an accident?' Both girls denied it, until the 6 year old suddently burst into tears. 

This was like an admission, so the car was abruptly pulled over at the next rest station, which was thankfully close, and both girls were dragged out to use the toilet, even the 10 year old, who was silent all that time. They were dragged to the toilet to get their pants checked. I said I needed to pee so I jumped out too, headed for the gents, peed and checked my pants too (they were thankfully clean). When I returned, we waited for another 15 minutes before my gf's sister and the girls returned, the 6 year old still crying, with reports of clean pants.

Why she was crying I don't know, as we continued the drive, she was still sniffling. We got to our destination half an hour later, driving in silence, no music, no talking, with the windows down. It was bliss. I talked to my girlfriend later on about the crying and she explained how she had an accident in school recently, and she kept denying it, she sat in class with smelly underwear and denied it constantly, even when the teacher discovered what she had done. She must have been crying because it reminded her of the telling off she got for lying about it last time.

TL;DR I farted in a car with my niece, she got blamed for pooping herself."

Meet this girl ""Magenta"". She's cool as hell and sexy to boot . Except She's got a fucked up thumb. It's like smashed and miscolored. Anyways on to the Fuck up. Going strong for 3 months with kisses and makeouts finally I'm hard as granite for days on end nsfw pics and gifs aren't doing it... I need the pussy. So I simply ask. No joke ""wanna have sex tonight because I'm hard enough to please fuckin Marianas trench"".

""Yeah we've been dating for 3 mon-""
Without warning I get punched directly in my giant half black nose. When I can see again the two are screaming at each other and I have no idea what's going on. I walk back to my porch when ""Butch "" jumps the stairs and grabs a shovel and starts swinging it at me ... Welp I'm not proud of what happened next .... I ran away like a sacred animal.

29w2e1,non_TBI,"I am in a fairly new relationship with a girl who speaks English as her third language. She speaks English very well, but sometimes there are words that she mixes up from time to time. 

We decided to go on a group vacation with some friends, and we had a room to ourselves. We previously had sex a few times, but we were just starting to get into the ""what do you like to do during sex?"" phase. She told me that she really enjoyed the man being rough with her during sex. I told her I had no issues with that, and wanted to know how rough she liked for the man to get. She said that she really enjoyed being held down, hair pulled, slapped, etc. I agreed to try these things with her the next time. 

So fast forward to later that night. We are having sex, and I reach up and slapped her in the face. Nothing too hard, but enough to hurt for sure. She had somewhat of a shocked look on her face, but I felt like it was all apart of the act, so I reached up and slapped her a second time a little harder. She stops and asks ""What are you doing?"" I said ""Slapping you like you asked"" and she replied with ""No, the slapping on the ass!"" ""Do you mean spank?"" ""YES! Spanking! Not slapping!"" 

She was incredibly understanding, but I still couldn't help but feel bad about what I did. "

This all happened at a stop light, windows down, while a black man was crossing in the crosswalk very close to my window.

27z3w0,non_TBI,"I was driving back home after a day of work & evening with my gf @~2am

Long straight street, it was hot outside (~26°C) and not a single car around as you can tell by the day/hour so i thought it was ok to leave car windows open.

...Until 1km from home.

There the apocalypse happened in 0.5 seconds.

Imagine the street: ditch left & right with the typical grass leaves coming out from the street borders.

No time to think at all.

I see a movement on the right and a rough sound of something hitting my  right mirror..

...And some hot liquid hitting my face in that exact moment. (N.d.a: I live in italy so I was sitting/driving in the LEFT seat.)

My glasses were completely covered in something that was completely covering my eyesight so i paniked and braked blindly.

I somehow managed NOT to fell in the ditch but then I removed my glasses and turned the internal car light on.

Blood.

On my glasses, on the front seats.

Started paniking I realized what happened.

A turkey (YAY, A TURKEY) decided it was a good time to die (so sorry btw).

I stopped the car and looked at the backseats with a torch.

There it was.

Covered in blood the turkey was ""sitting"" on my backseat.

The backseat was completely full of shit & blood.

I paniked more.

I opened the car doors and gently moved away the turkey with a shopping bag i found on the trunk.

I stopped outside the car for like 10 mins looking at that mess.

Then I finally decided it was time to go back home, cleaned the glasses on my blood-covered-t-shirt, and started cleaning the car and myself with alcohol.

Went to bed @ 5am.


TL;DR: almost beheaded a turkey while driving. turkey in the impact sprayed blood all over me & IN the car. Shitted all over the backseats.
3 hours to clean up all this mess.

3kjas9,non_TBI,"This is a fresh fuck up so bear with me. 

I woke up about an hour and a half ago at about 6am as usual. I was browsing reddit on my phone trying to wake up and get on with my day when the forces of hell took over my stomach seemingly out of nowhere. I had to evacuate my bowels and I had to do it now. 

I waddle out of my bedroom with my butthole clenched so tight you couldn't hammer a nail through. Salvation was only a few steps away until I heard and realized the shower was on. My roommates both take ridiculously long showers. My heart sank and my bowels howled in rage. 

I walked over to the kitchen and quickly went over my options. Do I knock on the door and ask him to hurry up? I did. He said okay. I went back to the kitchen. Do I shit in the sink? No we prepare food there. 

Maybe I can place a couple paper towels on the deck and assault them with my butt butter.

The dam that was my anus was struggling to hold back the coming storm. I had to act now. We live on the third story of an apartment with a deck that's surrounded by buildings and trees.

I open the door, squat up on the wooden fencing and position my lower half over the side and without a second thought, unleash the hell spawn that had taken over my intestines. Hours of fermenting, watery shit falling through the air and into the concrete below.

An ear piercing shriek cut through the air followed by a dog whimpering. My downstairs neighbor who I had spent a couple weeks flirting with was now staring right into my brown starfish that was still relentlessly producing diarrhea right on to her Pomeranian mix. 

She broke eye contact with my fart factory and looked deep into my soul with the most sadness I had seen any human express. I'm sitting on my bed. I'm not sure I can go to work.  

TL;DR: I shit on my cute neighbors shitty dog.



UPDATE: So I got a call at work from my roommate who was home today. Apparently the cops showed up and said that someone called in saying that someone from our apartment had assaulted their dog. Is this legal? How can I be identified by my stink eye like that.

Also, to those of you saying I should have pooped in a trash can; This poop had the spread of a 12g shotgun. There was no way a measly wastebasket could contain the butt blast that happened. My back deck is fairly enclosed by trees so it wasn't like I was out in public. I figured since it was raining it would be washed away by the time someone went out there.

2hdnzn,non_TBI,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but this is something that just happened a couple of hours ago (or I guess over the course of the past couple of months)

A little background information: I just moved in to a new studio in LA. It's pretty small and the building and plumbing is pretty old. The 70s, in fact. 

So lately I have been a little ""lonely"" and have been practicing having an orgasm by myself more than usual. For some reason, I decided that my sink would be my final destination. No big deal, I've done that before. In addition, like any person with facial hair, I have been shaving over my sink as well.

However, a couple of days ago I noticed that it was taking a long time for my sink to drain. After using the sink last night for teeth-brushing in such, I found that this morning it had not completely drained. I was a little nervous that it had something to do with my white hot fireworks display every once in a while that takes place in my sink, but I was hoping it was a different reason. So I called up maintenance.
This is where it gets kind of gross.

I called up maintenance and he starts kind of digging around to see if it's a problem he can fix without tearing stuff apart. ""Yep, there's a lot of hair in here"" he said, with his finger down my sink hole. I was a little relieved, thinking: *Okay, someone with long hair who lived here before most have clogged it and it's catching up on me.* WRONG.

After a second he pulled out his finger, and it is covered in black hairs (face and pubes, seemingly) covered in that mixed-with-water chunky semen. My face turns bright red and he tells me that he needs to go grab a bucket.

He comes back a few minutes later and pulls apart my pipes, when this HUGE chunk of the gross, brown semen-hair mixture comes pouring out into the bucket. Putting aside the disgusting visual of it all, instantly my 450 sq. ft. apartment starts smelling like sewage. I am on the verge of puking and I can hear the maintenance guy mumbling *Jesus Christ* under his breath.

I sat down and didn't speak a word to him other than repeatedly saying thank you and I'm sorry, but he was really kind about it when he left. I'll be sure to give him a tip next time I see him around.

3vn8u5,non_TBI,"I live in an apartment complex in the heart of a college town surrounded by fraternities on both sides. As expected, they have parties every weekend but it's not much of an issue because they end it by 11PM to follow noise regulations. However another tenant in my own apartment complex seems to have missed the citywide memo and continues to throw parties well past 3AM. The music is so loud, its as if the walls between or complexes don't exist. Last week, in the midst of studying for a dental school block exam, I decided that I can no longer tolerate the noise and called the cops... Upon my request, the cops came and disbanded their little party giving them a warning that there is a fine associated with not following the noise ordinance. Problem solved right? This week they had a party again, this time even louder than last week. Being the loser I am, I stay home on Saturday nights to study. After enduring the noise for 2 hours, I decided 1 AM was the cutoff. I walked out to make sure that the noise is coming from the right apartment. Just as I walk out, the door from the noisy apartment opens and I see the tenant. I came up and politely asked her if she could lower the volume. Immediately, I can see that this drunk chick was able to piece the pieces in her head and deduce that I was the one who called the cops last week. ""Absolutely. Oh I'm so sorry. Please don't hesitate to let me know when our noise gets out of control and next time don't go straight to the cops."", she said. It was a bit awkward but I was glad we were on the same page. She lowered her music and I was able to study. Fast forward 2 hours and I am fast asleep from the entire day of studying. I hear a loud knock on my door and a drunk guy screaming ""KEEP IT DOWN!"". He laughs to his buddy as he scrambles off. Now like clockwork, someone is running by my door and screaming ""keep it down!"" every 20 minutes, each time someone new.
TLDR: Called cops on noisy neighbors, became target for dozens of vengeful, drunk college kids."
2ss088,non_TBI,"My nephew is 10 months old and teething, so his parents have these homemade smoothie/ice pop hybrids for him.

 They looked awesome, I was craving something sweet, and he chows down on them so his mom remakes them everyday. I thought taking one while babysitting wouldn't be a bad thing. They were REALLY good, like the best smoothie I'd ever had mated with the best strawberry ice pop and they had a baby. 

So I stole a second one. They remake them anyway!

My brother and his wife got home, saw me playing with the plastic top for one of them (They're refillable plastic molds) and asked if nephew had woken up.

I owned up to it, said no, I had a craving for strawberry and they looked good so I tried one, and since they were *really* good I took a second one. 
My sister-in-law snorted, smiled, and commented very sweetly that she was glad I liked it, she worked hard on them, as my brother turned red and looked like he was going to laugh.
 As he drove me home to our parents, he let me in on why she giggled  when she took the plastic tops from me.

Apparently she makes them by pureeing fresh fruit, straining it, and then mixing it with breast milk.

I can never look my sister-in-law in the eye again, but my brother agrees the teething pops are awesome.

2nybdm,non_TBI,"Today I fucked up cringeworthy...

My daily commute involves riding the subway. This is the time I'm getting my daily dose of reddit.


After I arrived home from work, I made myself some awesome tarte flambée, which has chopped onions on top. So I sat at the kitchen table and ate it, when I noticed a small strip of onion on my chair, so I put it in my mouth and started chewing.

Then I realized that the texture does not fit onion and spat it out and saw a horrible yellowish strip of large toenail, which seems to have stuck on my trousers from the subway chair and hitched with myself home and fell on the kitchen chair.


I will never forget this feeling :/

37dvp0,non_TBI,"This happened today and Ill start with some context. So already looking like a middle eastern man, I get dirty looks by people on a daily basis. Today in history, we learned about terrorism and the event of 9/11 and why it happened. Being a reddit lurker, I remembered a funny thing I read on /r/jokes. I told it to my friends:
Goes something like:
Hey man did you know my dad died on a plane on 9/11?
O thats so sad to hear
Do you know what he said before he left me?
What?
ALLAHU AKBAR!!!

which then made me and my friends burst into laughter. Being a quiet guy myself, my teacher asked me whats so funny and I had to say it cause I thought it was funny, but all I got was looks of shock. Good bye my good reputation.

**TL:DR** ALLAHU AKBAAAAAAAAAARRRRRR!!!
"
2xke1c,non_TBI,"This is an x-post from earlier this week. Mods took it down due to me breaking Rule #3. Here's for my second chance.

I was dating this gorgeous blonde in high school (we will call her Sarah) and our daily routine would be to come home from school, get in bed, have sex and watch some tube until she left to go home. She started taking birth control and it messed with her ability to get wet (at least that is what she told me). We decided to go to a sex shop and get some water based lube to help with that.

I have to put a visual in in your head so bare with me. Get it? Bare? Okay, back to the story.

We were feeling extra horny this particular day. We started our ritual and things were going great! She would jack me off with the lube in her hands and I would finger her with lube on mine. Things were getting pretty juicy (in the literal sense) and decided to experiment with all holes. Using our juicy hands, we grabbed the bottle of lube and squirted some on us. We placed the bottle down on the night stand leaving a film of lube, pussy juice, ball hair and saliva on the bottle. I got halfway into her before realizing I will need more lube. Grab the bottle and pour some on me. I then proceeded to stroke myself to get it spread out. Then placed the bottle on the night stand leaving an extra film of.... assjuice. The bottle remained there even after we were finished. 

We got cleaned up and proceeded with the rest of the ritual by watching some tube just in time for my parents to return from work. We are both laying there, satisfied, wore out and blood red. In walks mom.

""How was school?""

""It was alright.""

""Did you do anything exciting?""

""Not really.""

""What's this?"" She picks up the bottle of lube and Sarah and I both go pale. ""Is this lube?""

""Yeah"" I said thinking of a way to get out of this awkward situation. ""You know how Sarah has ankle and foot pains? I use that to rub her feet."" (I thought this would work. I was a kid who just finished having sex).

*Dodged a bullet there*

""Oh really? So, you wouldn't mind rubbing my feet with it then.""

*SHIT*

""Mom, I would really rather not. My hands are still tired from rubbing her feet earlier.""

*hehe*

""Oh no! I insist. If you really use it for her feet then it would be no problem using it on me.""

""Just do it."" Sarah says

I stand up and grab the sticky bottle from her hands imagining all the liquids that are caked on it. All the while, Sarah is sitting on the floor imagining the same thing. It's eerily quiet while I pour a bit of lube in my hands. 'am I really about to do this?' I thought to myself. Mom lays on the bed with her feet right towards me. She closes her eyes and tilts her head back. I feel as if I should just confess and get this awkward shit over with. I believe my determination of not wanting to hear the sex talk at this point made me proceed to rub my hands together.

With my hands all lubed up and.... contaminated, I placed my hands on my moms' feet. I start giving a half-assed massage with a completely disgusted look on my face. I try to close my eyes and imagine it to be Sarah just to help with my nausea a little bit.

""Make sure you get my ankles as well""

That sure did fuck up the mental picture.

Here I am. Rubbing pussy, ass, dick lube on my moms' feet and ankles while she is grunting. This is indeed rock bottom. I stare at Sarah with a ""Hey! We're in this together"" look. Let's not forget a disgusted, concerned and shameful look as well. This goes on for the longest 60 seconds of my life.

""Okay! I'm done!""

She stands up and puts her socks back on. I walk to the bathroom and wash my hands off with close to boiling water. When I return, mom is still standing there and Sarah is sitting on the bed. We are all standing there in shame of what we just did. Then it dawned on me. She knew the entire time! She just wanted to teach us a lesson we'll never forget.

Before she leaves the doorway she very sternly says, ""Stop having sex in my house."" and walks away.

Needless to say, I started hiding my lube as carefully as I hid my weed.

TL/DR;

Mom alpha'd the shit out of me.

EDIT: One of you fine redditors should narrate this.

EDIT#2: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0CPCGpJfc2a - Narration by redditor /u/voiceinthesky

That was awesome and the music truly does justice. Thanks so much!

Also, Thanks to all the redditors here who have come to read the most awkward moment of my life. I surely don't have proof of this to all the non-believers but as in any story (even the moon landing), there are bound to be people who are skeptical. Lastly, thanks to all the fine people who PM'd me and said some strange shit. You da real MVP."
2lrljl,non_TBI,"This little gem happened when I was 18. (It happened two years ago now, but I think it's worth sharing here.)

So, I was *that* kid in high school who really desperately wanted a relationship. Most of my good friends were in these exceptionally long-lasting relationships, and I was pretty much a 5th/7th wheel most of the time. That shit got to me. 

I would whine to my mom a lot of the time and ask her what made me so undesirable that I couldn't be in a relationship like that, too. (I discovered later on that there were **A LOT** of reasons for that, but I'll save those for another time.)

My mom would always say, ""Son, wait until college. High school just isn't your time.""

When I finally went to college a couple years back, my body was ready. I said, Fuck it. *I will become a new college man. I will slay college poon. And maybe, just maybe, I will find the college girl of my dreams.*

Flash forward a couple months, and I'm seeing a girl. We'll call her Karen. Now Karen and I had been seeing each other and hooking up for about a month. Nothing serious. But I wasn't seeing/hooking up with anyone else. I don't think she was, either.

Anyway, our hook-up sessions were getting progressively more intense by this point. What started with brief kisses standing up quickly morphed into extended make-outs laying next to each other on the bed. This was already a lot of kink and frisk to take in for a prudish high school virgin like myself. 

But this time was different. Things got hotter and heavier than ever before. Karen was laying on her back. Instinctively, I pick my body up and lower it on top of hers. This shit was fucking happening. I slowly and hesitantly place my hands at her sides. She seems amused. Blood racing, heart beating, I glide them ever so slightly underneath her shirt. *I'm touching bare skin now, holy shit!* She's still amused.

Then, I know what to do. I glide my hands up her shirt and under her bra and until I'm straight-up feeling some A-cup boobies. Satisfied, Karen leans into me and kisses me quite passionately. I was aroused. I was erect. I was into it. Sex could happen, but this moment right here was all I needed.

But all of a sudden, I feel an all-too-familiar warm, stuffy sensation coming. I open my eyes and stop kissing. I stop everything all at once. My erection shrunk faster than Rick Moranis could shrink the kids. Instead, I look petrified at Karen's face.

Karen blinks her eyes open and asks if everything is okay. But it didn't take long for Karen to *feel* what had happened. 

In the intimate moment, I nosebled on her face. There were traces of noseblood all across Karen's left cheek and forehead.

Thankfully, she was nice about it and got me tissues and made sure I was alright. But needless to say, I never felt Karen's boobs again after that day.

TL;DR Prudish college boy virgin touches girl's boobs for the very first time. Could have sex. Nosebleeds on her face instead. No sex.


EDIT: Wow, it's crazy how this post blew up. I definitely wasn't expecting all of this. A couple things I want to clarify. 

1) Karen was actually very nice about the whole ordeal, and it wasn't actually because of the nosebleed that we stopped seeing one another. It was mostly because of my next point.

2) I met my current girlfriend a matter of days after this story took place. I realized almost immediately upon meeting her that I connected with her on a much deeper level than I ever connected with Karen. So, it was me who broke things off with Karen. Not my bloody nose.

3) I was very naive and innocent when I first entered college (and still am now). I wanted my story to reflect my mindset at the time.

4) At least at my college, ""hooking up"" refers to most intimate physical activity that is NOT sex. Sex is just called sex.

5) I'm glad to know my story is basically an anime. "
330ltp,non_TBI,"This happened last month but I just found this sub...

I'm 14 and during my school's March break (spring break) my dad decided to take us for a week vacation at our family cottage in the woods. It's cold this time of year and not a fun time to be there but he wanted us to disconnect from technology and enjoy nature. He made me and my sister leave our cellphones, computers at home because we are on them all the time. We were allowed to bring books, boardgames though. My dad works in IT and did bring his laptop because in case of work emergencies he could tether with his cell phone and do some work (cottage has no wifi).

After a few days of muddy hikes, feeding birds, and ""enjoying nature""  I was really bored and also really horny. At home, I jerk off to porn multiple times a day but at the cottage no porn and no alone time (I slept in the same room as my sister.)

During breakfast one day dad decided that the family should hike to this peninsula by the lake. I am sick of hiking and made an excuse not to go. The rest of the family leaves and I am left alone at the cottage, the hike is at least a couple hours.

I remembered at home that my dad connects his laptop to the TV so we can watch movies he downloads. So I decided to open his laptop and see if he has any new movies to watch. His computer is password protected by I have seen him enter it so many times I remember what it is. 

Looking through the computer I can't find any movies, but I know he has them. So I do a search for .mov, .mpeg, .mvk, .mp4 etc

A bunch of stuff comes up, movies, etc, jackpot! Then I discover some video files with porn titles. I go to the hidden folder where they are stored and find a bunch of porn movies. 

Obviously, I am horny so I close the blinds and start to jerk off. I go through the different files watching all the porn which is awesome after not having any for a bit. 

I open the next video in the series with a boring title just some numbers and letters and I see a POV of a woman having sex, the camera is on her vagina and I continue to jerk off. The camera pans up and I see my mom's face!!! It is my dad fucking my mom!!! 

Stop jerking off immediately, close the video, clear the search history and recent files in VLC, shut down the laptop and put it away. 

I cant get the image out of my head and its fucked up because I am still so horny from the jerking but also disgusted. I spent the next hour just trying to distract myself without much luck at all.

The family comes back and I can't look at my parents at all. I put my boots on and say I am feeling better and will go for a hike. I got out of there as quickly as I could and spent the next few hours in the woods sitting on a rock avoiding coming back. 

Dinner and the next few days were so awkward and painful to be with my family. It is a month later and Im still fucked up about it. 



EDIT: WOW, this really blew up! For those who were concerned and offered some advice, thanks! I guess its not so strange and with time that memory will hopefully fade."
4014go,non_TBI,"So this happened some time ago. Probably 7 years ago and it still haunts me to this day.

It was New year's Eve. I lived in the city but during holidays, it was a tradition to visit my hometown and spend the holidays in there. In the province, I have a lot of cousins, dumbfuck cousins who are most likely qualified to become a member of jackass. Hours before midnight, we were already drunk and some of my cousins decided it was now time to play with the firecrackers. Now this is where it gets silly. We were all goofing around with the firecrackers, lighting one up and throwing it at one another then we run away from it, laugh, and do it again. Now our house is beside a narrow river so we have a small bridge beside our house that connects to the other side of the road. On the other side of that bridge is another house, a little house that doubles as a food shop.

It was all fun and games, we decided that it was fun to stick those triangular firecrackers in the crevices of the bridge and light it up. When it explodes, it shakes the bridge and we laugh about it. Those firecrackers that was supposed to be lit up then shoots towards the sky and explodes are being lit up laying down on the other side of the bridge while some of us stands on the other side. Fuck yeaah bowling style except the bowling balls are firecrackers and the bowling pins are humans.

For the finale, my cousin took out this firecracker that I believe is the devil reincarnate. It was the size of baseball with pure gunpowder inside. This shit is scary, when it explodes, it literally shakes your inside, it rips car tires to shred. So before the night ends, we lit two of those. BOOM! HAPPY NEW YEAR! bla bla, we exchanged drunken pleasantries and called it a night and went home. That doesn't sound so bad, right?

Morning came and when I woke up, there was a commotion outside. Lots of people are looking down the river and in the bridge. When I went to see what's going on. I shat myself.

The MOTHERFUCKIN FOOD SHOP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE IS MISSING. 
A lot of the furniture and items in the house are now floating or is now a furniture owned by the fish at the bottom of the river. Investigation results says that the soil underneath the house was already loose and it gave in. Thankfully no one died, the people who owns the house is on vacation.

As for me and my cousin, other than mother nature, we believe that we also have a hand on that incident, we never spoke about it and we console each other by saying that it was better that way, that we made it happen sooner rather than later and someone might have died.

tl;dr: played with firecracker on new year's eve, helped mother nature demolish a house beside river."
2kl6ob,non_TBI,"I've been working as a host at a fine dining restaurant which opened up just a few months ago.  One of the things we've been instructed to do is use last names as much as possible while interacting with guests.  So this guy, probably around 45-50 years old walks up to me with his wife.  He asks me to make him a reservation for their anniversary in a couple of weeks.  I ask him for his last name, which I then type into the computer we do the reservations on.  This computer also happens to store information on the guests and their previous visits to our restaurant.  He had visited before and we had two names under the reservation- a man and a woman.  Let's go ahead and say that the two names were Robert and Sarah.  Excitedly thinking to myself ""I can really surprise the guests and impress them by using their first names!"" I look up and ask ""Oh, Robert and Sarah?""

The look on the woman's face was like nothing I have ever seen.  She is not Sarah, but she certainly knew exactly who Sarah is.  ""I thought that was over 4 years ago"" was the only thing she said to him.  Keep in mind, the restaurant had only been open for 6 or so months at the time. She then took off her ring, put it on the counter in front of me, told me to ""give it to a nice girl someday"" and then left.

The man looked like he was about to jump over the counter and strangle me.  I managed to spit out a half assed ""Sorry"" but the damage was done.  He gave me a look, grabbed the ring and then took off after her. So there's how I ended a marriage by attempting to be fancy.  Lesson learned.

1an9bh,non_TBI,"This is not a fucking joke or a god damn game.  I ate 3 boxes of ""Fiber one bars"" as my exclusive food due to extreme laziness in the last 2 days and I cannot even understand how much I am fucking farting.

I want to die, it's like I'm inhaling through my mouth and exhaling through my ASS.  Continuous loud yelling moans are destroying my asshole.

I know this is a bold claim, but if you don't believe it, try it yourself - you will regret.  This is worse than the time I ate an entire box of sugar free cookies."
3ct9aw,non_TBI,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I just need to share this with somebody.

I have had, since ~1 week, a swollen 1x1 cm area on my body. Kind of similar to a pimple, but without the white stuff inside. Just swollen, curving out of the skin a little.

But this ""thing"" hurt a little. More than swollen tissue normally do. And it also slowly grew in size. So after a week, I began to wonder wtf it was.
 
The best thing would of course be to go to a doctor. But this was located on an awkward place on my body: ~3 cm diagonally upwards from my little-man. And shy as I am, I prefer not show my privates to random people, even not doctors. So I decided to investigate it myself. :(
 
So I grabbed a needle and a small knife, thinking that it might be a pimple that just was a bit under the surface. I have had many of those in my past (and those were easily popped with careful use of a needle). 

I did, however, found out pretty quickly that if this was similar to those I had in the past, this was located a little deeper.

So I removed the top tissue carefully with a knife, and was surprised that there was almost zero blood coming out of this small would I was creating.

And then I saw it. Something was fucking moving. And I feel absolutely disgusted even thinking about it while writing this.
Let's not go into lots of details for everybody's sanity - but let's say like this: I now have, after an insane session of digging, a massive fucking hole close to my poor little-man, and things crawling in my bathroom sink.

And I am scarred for life. Literally. 

I am, in all honesty, afraid of even looking at my privates after what I found - and I think my relationship with sexy-times where I am included, is forever ruined. 

I might even say that my relationship with my entire body is **forever** ruined. (Why the fuck should I believe that the rest of my body is free from these things?!)

This happened 30 minutes ago. And of course I can't tell *anybody* about this, especially since how shy I usually am. 

If anybody wants to kill me, this is the perfect moment to do so. :(

TL;DR: Pimple looking, worm filled madness. **The definition of NOPE.**

2y4juy,non_TBI,"Circa 2002.

I was living in China for a year or so at the time, studying Chinese, enjoying student life and discovering what the world had to offer.

There was nothing going on this evening and my fellow dorm mates had already gone to bed, I decided I’d go in search of the elusive happy ending.

I hailed a taxi, and in my broken Chinese, I asked to be taken to a place that offers ‘special massage’. The driver seemed very happy to oblige and without much thought, took off into the night with me nervously sitting beside him.

Upon arriving I was not too enthused. The establishment looked like it had been closed for years and resembled the kind of place people might hold illegal dog fights. There was a single green light shining through the main door, so I proceeded to open and enter. I was greeted by a gentleman with absolutely no facial expressions who sternly asked, “what do you want?”.

See, in China at that time, there weren’t a lot of foreigners living and studying as I was. To add to that I certainly didn’t know any others who were taking strange taxi rides at night to unknown destinations, so I kind of expected to get that kind of reception from people.

I replied to the man that I was looking for a massage. I said it with a smile on my face, hoping he might pick up on my subtleness. He ushered me into a changing room, told me to get naked, put on some slippers and go through the door at the end of the changing room.

I’ve always been a little uncomfortable getting naked in changing rooms and this time was no different. But I wanted to see what lay beyond the door, and I figured that being naked was my ticket to potential pleasure. Boy, was I wrong.

I dropped my clothes and belongings into a locker and proceeded through the door at the end of the changing room. I pushed through the door with confidence and it opened up to a completely white tiled room with a bench around the entirety, open showers, and what looked like something you might see in a horror movie in the middle. It was a large white tiled box about 6x6 ft and 4ft off the floor with a drain in the middle that looked like it was there to collect blood from a slit throat. Lets call it the slaughter box.

There were probably 15 men inside who were also naked, sitting on the benches around the room, and when I entered they all completely went silent and stared at me like I was an alien from out of space with 4 heads and 8 legs.

I’ve never to this day felt more awkward than I did in that moment. I wasn’t scared, but I just felt like I couldn’t be in a more uncomfortable situation. That was, until an old man approached me, took my hand and started leading me to the slaughter box.

The old man had a sort of glove on his hand that looked like a mitten covered in steel wool. He motioned for me to lay prone on the box, which I did, then he proceeded to pour small amounts of water on me from a bucket that sat nearby. Once I was good and lathered the steel wool glove started its magic. He rubbed me down, starting at my shoulders, and I remember looking at the water flowing past my face seeing dead skin flowing to the drain in the middle. Didn’t feel too bad, and I thought to myself how nice that all that dead skin will be removed from my shoulders.
He then continued down my back and didn’t stop when he reached my asshole.

He cleaned my ass the way a butcher might clean a cows colon before being sold to a hungry carnivore. I was flipped over at one point and he didn’t miss one spot on my body. Lying there on my back, he was deep in my groin, making sure there would be no dead skin on my balls, shaft, gooch or anywhere else.

All the while the 15 men in the room never took their eyes of me. It was the most brutal 10 minutes of my life having that old man exfoliate my body with such a captive audience. When he was done, and I’d been washed down, my red raw exterior was quite a sight. I sat up off the slaughter box, looked down at my feet, mustered the energy and courage and went back through the door into the changing room.

Got changed back into my clothes and went back to reception where I was charged the equivalent of USD$3. I then stood outside in the freezing snow for 20 minutes waiting for a taxi and contemplated what had just happened. Went home and slept like a baby.

TL;DR - Went seeking for a happy ending massage and ended up have balls, ass and penis rubbed down by old man with a steel wool mitten.

2iz2zg,non_TBI,"I'm going to preface this story by saying I'm originally from the Caribbean (Barbados) and most of the food we eat is inherently spicy. I'm going to go into some detail here so if you are squeamish I suggest you don't read on. So, I do a fair amount of traveling in my line of work so I eat out pretty much every weekend. This particular weekend I was in a city called Kingston, ON where there was this nice little English pub which where my colleagues and I decided we were going to eat. I really wanted to get wings as I was in the mood for something spicy but I also wanted a burger so the waitress suggested that I eat this burger called the widow maker. I scoffed at the name.. ""Pfff widow maker I'm from the Caribbean, we have some of the hottest food on the planet, how hot could this possibly be?"" After reading over the ingredients, (suicide sauce, spicy ketchup, spicy sausage, jalapeños, banana peppers and some sort of spicy cheese) I figured  that it didn't seem like it was going to be THAT bad. Fast forward and the burger arrives at my table. I take the first bite.. OK.. That IS pretty spicy. I hadn't even gotten into the jalapeños yet which were freshly cut with the seeds in. It took me about 30 minutes to finish this thing and it was the hottest thing I have ever eaten in my entire life. I could not feel my tongue and the tissue in my mouth and my esophagus felt shredded. That's not even the worst part. Fast forward to the next morning and here is where it get so much worse. The morning shit. Before I sat down on the toilet I knew something wasn't right in my stomach.  I started the evacuation process and it felt like I was being penetrated by Satan himself. It was barely solid and felt like I was peeing hot sauce out of my ass. I finish and go to wipe. Blood. Lots and lots of blood. I feel sorry for whoever had to clean that up because it looked like a murder scene in there even after several flushes. I chose not to go to the hospital out of sheer embarrassment. Luckily it worked itself out and I was good after a day and a shit ton of pepto.

Tl;dr - Ate an insanely hot burger that made me shit a lot of blood.

EDIT: To those saying I don't have a tolerance for spicy foods.. You're wrong. Also edited spiciest to some of the spiciest. Sorry to the spicy food enthusiasts.

EDIT 2: Obligatory thanks for front page! Glad my ass could brighten your day. Also the name of the restaurant is the Merchant Tap house for those of you asking.

EDIT 3: Thank you you for the gold kind stranger!"
3x3c9v,non_TBI,"So I'm in Ethiopia right now on a holiday to visit my family. I'm from Australia though but anyway. It's around 9 when I wake up. As usual I do my morning rituals and I ask my aunt what she's made for breakfast and then she replies ""here's 20 Birr (Ethiopian currency) go buy whatever you want."" So I take the money and get my shoes and head out the door to satisfy my rumbling tummy with the fine foods that this nation provides. So I decide to go to a restaurant I went a couple of days earlier where they served a delicious omelet and had a basket of complimentary fruits on each table. I'm finally there and I go take a seat at one of the tables. I order the same omelet and juice and the side veggies that I ordered they other day. I finish my delicious meal and feel satisfied. I pay for my meal and then just before I leave I say what the heck and take an orange for the hell of it. 


Bare in mind that I'm in Ethiopia so there are many wild animals on main roads and streets. So I'm walking home and then I noticing a goat. I'm looking at the goat and I immediately know there's something wrong with it. I approach it and think that maybe it's hungry. Oh what a coincidence, I have an orange for him. I peel the orange and then I don't want to toss in on the ground as the orange may get dirty so then I hold it in front of him and feed it to him. As soon as it takes its first nibble I can feel a rush of energy come through it. I assume it's the sugar that is giving it energy because he seems more active then he was before. This is when shit got real. It went for 0-100, REAL QUICK. It looked at me strangely for about 10 seconds and I was also confused. All of a sudden it's started yelling like a fucking, well, retard. This is when I shit you not, it's starts chasing me. Imagine this. A 17y/o black kid, 5'9, 220pds, getting chased by a fucking psycho goat in the middle of a fucking busy road. Yep. It's ridiculous. So I'm just running from this bloody psycho animal and i am running my arse off. Eventually I give up. I turn around. It's tackles me. My pants tear at the groin area, somehow. I have no clue how but it just did. After this happens I go home all dusty and my Aunt says, ""where the hell have you been?"" I tell them my story and they just laugh at how stupid the whole thing was. 

"
2tivh7,non_TBI,"This happened some years ago, but I did not know about reddit back 
then... So here you go:

I was in a very nice relationship with this girl, Les. We were young, happy, and horny. Both of us were virgins at that time; the idea of losing it together was viable.

During the time we were together, I spent a month abroad traveling with my family, while she stayed home. Of course, all that time away from each other made us much hornier that usual, so when we saw each other again, the temperature rose quickly. I usually went to her house, which had a very nice living room where we spent the afternoon doing young couple's stuff.

The day I came back, I went straight to hers. The urge to see her was uncontrollable. As I said before, the accumulated horniness of a month created an environment full of lust. We agreed on having sex after the adults of the house left.

The grown-ups had left, the house was empty for us to use; the foreplay started. In the midst of the action, she decided to get some water ready (who knows, maybe we will get thirsty, we did not know what was going to happen during sex) and went to the kitchen. I followed Les to the kitchen. She sat on the counter while I was pouring some glasses of water, and when I finished, I approached her to make out. Suddenly, Les's grandfather entered the kitchen and saw us in an intense kissing position; disaster followed (the house was supposed to be empty!). As the grandfather stared at us angrily, both us were looking at him with a ""ñiomygawd"" face. She immediately noticed my boner almost ripping my jeans and tried to cover it (while I was completely frozen and going pale), which made him even angrier.

The grandfather started raging, exited the kitchen, and went to his library. Les followed him while I stood pale and motionless. I thought: ""of all the people, why him?""; ""oh shit! oh shit! oh shit""; ""what's going to happen next?"". After a while, her mother came home. We tried to explain we were just kissing, but the grandfather said he saw something else -boner detected-. While trying to get our stories straight, I noticed my girlfriend growing a bit pale. At first I thought nothing of it since, hey, my penis can only get so erect - and let me tell you, it was that erect, in front of her grandfather and mother no less. Then without any warning, or even a courtesy ""hey man, I'm out"" Les passed out. At this point I'm thinking, bitch is dead, my boner just murdered its first victim. Turns out she just couldn't handle the stress. I subsequently received one more ""I'm going to kill you"" stare from her grandfather before he left the room.

A couple of minutes later, I called my parents, went home, and talked to Les about what was going to happen. She broke up with me and stopped talking to me. For me, this was emotionally heavy, since I really liked our relationship and I was not expecting that to happen. Of course, I became morose... I was just a young adolescent which had a nice relationship and it all went to hell because of being so horny... hormones I concluded that my boner was too powerful for her or her family to handle.

In the following weeks, I tried to contact Les in order to fix what had happened. I tried setting up a meeting so we could deal with the situation, but there were excuses all the time; lies. Her mother would even lie to my mother, saying that ""Les was grounded"" and ""couldn't go out of the house unless it was going to school"". I found out that the source of these lies was that she was dating another guy while I was completely emotionally destroyed... Apparently, she met her new boyfriend during the month I was abroad, and their relationship started a couple of weeks before she broke up with me. My friends saw her at the movies with the new guy on a day that I was told: ""Les is still grounded"".

It took me a long time to get over it and it also scarred me for life. The fear of ""being caught"" is unbearable sometimes, and has brought me problems with my following relationships. I have learned to tame my boners for fear of any more needless carnage.

**TL;DR: massive boner wreaking havoc on my girlfriends family cost me a relationship and scarred me for life**

2dox7b,non_TBI,"Some people wanted the full story so here it goes.

   Yesterday, August 15, 2014, A younger me was walking through the halls of the college about to go to my dorm when suddenly, I stumbled upon my friend (let’s call him Fred). I asked Fred if he wanted to come with me to the store to get some chocolates and flowers followed by a trip to a fancy restaurant to call my reservation later… because guess whose 2 year anniversary it was. 
  

We get to the store and I went to the chocolate and candy section and looked at all the variety of the selections. Unaware of my fate in which will happen in a matter of 2 hours, I decided to get this fancy foreign dark chocolate which came in a nice plastic package wrapped in a bit of thin cardboard and a piece of ribbon as a finishing touch. I was gonna go all out on chocolates this year as it’s apparently a set precedent between us now. I took two of them to take one for myself to taste and eat and proceeded to head towards the flowers section. I asked the clerk for a dozen daffodils because she loves the scent of it. Me and my buddy left the store and dropped him off to his dorm and I proceeded to go to the restaurant and checked my reservation for a 6:30 dinner. All’s well and nothing could possibly go wrong on this perfect day.


  I drove back to the college and visited my theatre director and saw my girlfriend talking to him about the upcoming production blah blah blah. I stepped out and saw her friends waiting there, I didn’t see them the first time. So I come out with the flowers and chocolates in my plastic bag and encountered them in the hallway. So they greet me and say the usual, “Aww, how sweet of you.” And I respond saying it’s just a pre-dinner present. My first eff-up was telling them there’s gonna be a bigger present after dinner. They laugh it off thinking it was a joke. It wasn’t. I bought some rubber from the store as well thinking I was gonna get it later.

  I stepped out of the hallway for a little bit and went on like the outer area of the building and whipped out my phone. I heard a slight chatter from behind me as I put the phone in my ear, dialing my mother. The girls were about to step out of the building and didn’t know I was just outside the door (by the way the exit door doesn’t have windows on that part of the wall). I saw my gf walk out first and saw that firm buttocks of hers and lifted my left hand while my right hand was holding the presents and my phone. My left palm approached her behind and –- stop. Some background info time.


  My girlfriend is easily startled. That was also another fuck-up. For four years I’ve known her and she is easily startled. A dog barking would make her jump when we’re walking or something. I shoulda known. Anyways, I was on the phone, distracted and I didn’t think that quickly. That day she was wearing short denim shorts and a white blouse-ish top and carrying her purse on her left hand. She’s also the kind of person who holds their shit and only releases the mudfall when it really has to come out, yeah you know you are one too. Back to the present.


  Ftpp. My whole hand made a decently loud, “typical high-five” impact on her behind and the next thing I heard was a light squirm and the sound the movie soundbyte of a hundred ketchup bottle being squeezed empty at the same time (okay that might’ve been exaggerated). Next thing you know, there was a slice of wet chocolate cake being mushed inside her shorts and some slowly drip down on the floor. Her friends let out a huge gasp while we all stood there. My mother talking to me on the phone waiting for me to speak. I was speechless as well thinking, “What have I done.” Her legs are somewhat covered in droppings and she also just stood there frozen and looked up at the sky hoping it was a dream. About five seconds after the incident came showers of apology from my mouth while grabbing her stuff to get them of the way, her friends went in front of her asking if she was okay. She was still kind of looking up, almost crying if I remember correctly, just breathing in and out. I didn’t know what to do; I didn’t wanna be the asshole who caused the issue and not do something about it, but I also didn’t wanna get in there. Like, am I supposed to clean that up like I would clean up a baby’s diaper? So I told her, “Let’s go to the bathroom.” We were very fortuitous because there was a nearby bathroom to where we were standing and the next nearest bathroom was on the other building. I look at her and her jeans were darkened a little bit. She and her friends walked in the bathroom while I went to grab the stuff on the floor outside. This was at around 5:50 – 6:00 so that part of the building was a ghost-town. I picked up the flowers and chocolates, they were still intact and clean, and I got her stuff. I brought it inside and asked one of the girls to watch the stuff while I asked her roommate escort me to their dorm to get another pair of trousers. 


  We come back with another pair of underwear and brought some jeans this time as well as another top for her. The two other girls were outside the bathroom and told us that she’s there alone trying to clean it up. I asked to go in there while the other girls stood guard. I went in the lavatory and asked her if she was okay and that I brought clean clothes. I set them on the counter and gave her some privacy to clean up. I was gonna bring her a plastic bag to put the dirty clothes in there but I left the gifts in the dorm room. Another fuck-up. I asked the girls if they had any lying around, sadly none. I went outside again and called the restaurant telling them to cancel my reservation because there’s no way in hell we we’re gonna go there now. The short drive from the college to the dormitory was awkward for the five of us. No one spoke, the radio was off, and I just drove us to the girls’ dorm room. The other girls went into their own rooms and I told them I got this. We entered the dorm and she saw the chocolates and daffodils on the dresser and said, “Aww. Dark, I love it.” I was dumbfounded myself. It seems as if she just chose to forget that incident just happened.


  So to those who asked, no we didn’t break-up. We slept it off and discussed between the five of us never to discuss this again (so I’m the asshole by telling the story) and plus, she’s got dirt on me too, but that’s another story that won’t be told ever. We’re going to our anniversary dinner later at 6 PM again. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. And no, I will not post pictures >:O. Thanks for reading my fuck-ups, and don’t complain because it’s not as grand as you expected it to be because you guys asked for the whole novella.

P.S. How do I indent?

**TL:DR**
Slapped my gf's ass in front of her friends. She shat herself.

edit: I'm new to this subreddit. Apparently I should save the full story and post it tomorrow. I feel welcomed :D"
2u81rw,non_TBI,"This is a bit of a tifu stretch and actually happened when I was in grade 6. I'm now a 27 y/o female and was very sheltered as a child. My class was taking a standard information gathering test which consisted of personal questions i.e. height, weight, hair colour etc. So I read the first question on the test:

1. What is your sex? Circle M or F. 

I was immediately stumped. No idea what ""sex"" meant. (To put myself in context... I was the kid that wholeheartedly defended Santa Claus' existence until I was at least 14 yo and was absolutely crushed when I realized that the world had been collaboratively lying to me for 14 years.) I was vaguely aware that sex was something that men and women could do with each other but in that sentence the word meant nothing to me. 

My solution was simple. Check the kids paper sitting next to me. So I stealthily looked over my shoulder to my left and saw that the boy next to me had selected 'M'. Okay. Sure. Whatever. For good measure I checked the kid sitting to my right. He had also selected 'M'. Well that must be it then. So I pick 'M' and complete the remainder of the test with relative ease. Halfway through the class we were doing silent reading and the teacher was going through the tests at his desk. With confusion on his face he looked up at me and said ""BellaLovesNutella, you realize your Female, yes?"" and that's when it clicked that the M stood for Male. A little piece of me died that day.

TL;DR I copied another kids test and my teacher thought I had gender identity issues. "
2n6qvf,non_TBI,"Social media nightmare. 

My girlfriend and I have a morning routine on the weekends where we drink coffee in bed naked. We call it 'naked coffee.' 

She's out of town, so I decided to send her a Snapchat. I took a picture of me, naked, spread out on my bed with a mug of coffee in my hand. I put 'Naked Coffee' in the caption and sent it promptly at 9am. 

I went about the rest of my day, went to the gym then did a few errands. At 4:30pm I received this message from a good friend of mine: 

""Hey ...! Wasn't sure if you meant to do this or not but there's a naked picture on your snapchat 'my story' which is visible to the public. you can delete it by holding down on your username and I think it will point you in the right direction to delete it.""

I was feeling beyond embarrassed at this point. I quickly deleted the photo, then sent an update on FaceBook. I called it my ""leaked photo debut on Snapchat."" I texted my girlfriend about it and she thought it was hysterical. Best part about this whole mess is that she commented on the update and said, ""I liked it.""

TL;DR: I sent my girlfriend a naked photo of myself on Snapchat. I stupidly posted it to my story on accident and it was live for well over 4 hours, until I was notified by my friend. 

**EDIT:** I understand a few of you asked to see the picture for proof. I know you are disappointed but it has been deleted. I'm not about to debase myself any further. It really happened. 

**EDIT II:** Regarding it being on accident, I'm being honest. I use Android. I just tapped the arrow on the bottom to send it. When I figured out how to adjust the Snapchat settings after the fact, I saw that all posts were sent to My Story (the default option). It was pointed out you can specify who your stories are sent to; it's the custom option  but I didn't configure it until it was too late!

2xt2bx,non_TBI,"This happened about 5 minutes ago. 

So at my school we have a Digital Art class in which we learn how to use Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Today we were watching a particularly boring video on the big screen and somehow I feel asleep face-down on my desk. This was the FU. When I awoke, the entire room was empty and the lights were off. I was startled and thought that maybe the bell had rung and that everybody left. I walked out of the door and there was the entire class, with the teacher waiting to scare me. Their plan worked perfectly and I nearly pissed myself. So there I was, keyboard imprint on my face, stunned with fear, in-front of the entire class. 

TL;DR
I fell asleep in class and was scared shitless by the entire class.

Edit: Wow, Thanks for the Gold!"
2qii8t,non_TBI,"Okay, so this happened last year but as I've only recently joined Reddit I'd thought I'd post this.

My name is Brad and at the time my two best friends were a boy called M, and a girl N, and we'd been inseparable for years. We'd always joked about having the threesome but at this point I was a virgin. 

One night we're at N's local pub, and we get absolutely wasted and decide that the night is young and we should go for a walk down the canal near the pub. The area is secluded so we sit down to star-gaze and eventually we start three-way kissing (not an uncommon drunk activity for us at the time). 

This turned a little heavier and before you know it we're both simultaneously knuckle deep in N and well on the way to the joke becoming a reality. Eventually, amongst the moans, N gasps ""I want both of you to fuck me"" - a sentence that two 20 year old best friends rarely ignore for long. 

Knowing I was a virgin M tells me to go for it, so after attending to N for a little longer I drop my pants, and with all enthusiasm, proceed to lose my virginity to one of my best friends, as she is sucking on my other best friend's dick. Not a bad way to lose it you may think. 

The threesome is going brilliantly, me and M do the cliché eiffel tower and high-five over her back because you have to right? after we high five, M's eye flicker down towards my junk, his face drains of colour and he quickly mutters ""shit man there's fuck load of blood!"" 

I pull out to find my rapidly softening dick POURING with blood. I'd somehow managed to split my foreskin right down the middle. We then rush me to hospital, by which point I was feeling faint from lack of blood (and alcohol) and spent the night in a minor surgery ward with the specialist warning I would probably have to go for an emergency circumcision. 

In the end there was no harm done and I was let home at 5pm the next day with a bandage round my fella and a wounded ego. Before I left I got talking to the guy in the bed next to me who turned out to be a cancer patient, after explaining my story he winced and said ""fuck man! and I though I had it bad"" - made me smile i must say. 

I see the funny side of it personally, and think it's a great story about losing my virginity. Even better I now have a weird battle scar on my cock when it's hard and I think it looks quite dashing haha. 

TL;DR Lost v-plates with two best friends > ripped foreskin in half and spent night in hospital > Survived with battle scars!

EDIT: Cleaned up the formatting and added my name to clear up some confusion"
2k9ud1,non_TBI,"This happened not half an hour ago, I was getting ready for my job as a a bartender. I always wank before work, since it relaxes me and I can only assume my customers appreciate my shit eating grin. I recently discovered I can make myself squirt and have intense orgasms with my new vibrator. 6 orgasms down, I feel it coming...literally. I scoot to the end of my bed, not wanting to wash my sheets AGAIN, and proceed to shoot lady juices all over my floor. I lay back down, blissful, only to hear a knock at my door. My roommate starts to twist the door handle, I spring to my feet, only to have my post coital jelly legs slip in the mess I made for myself. My head cracks hard on the wooden floorboards, and my roomie having heard the crash, swings the door open, only to see me, clutching my vibrator, robe open, clutching my head in a puddle. She screams sorry and slams the door shut. 

Now I'm on my way to work, head pounding and shame burning deep in my stomach. I can't imagine the next time we pass in the hallway there will be much eye contact. 

TL;DR...slipped in a PUDDDLE of squirty lady juice, scarring my roommate for life, who was only offering me food. 




**Update for those who care**... 3am kitchen chats have confirmed I am in the clear. She burst out laughing when she saw my darting eyes, which lead to myself exploding into nervous laughter. You are all correct, I *should* have brought a towel! Lesson learnt. She has promised to become a better ""knocker"". I did not think this would ever make it to the front page, I thought it would die a little death just like I did! Oh well. Gross sex stuff seems to get the people going. I should have called it **""Bear_Roughback an erotic life.""** (Oh and the food was cheese and leftover deli meats for those who care. Hospo perks.) "
2cwklw,non_TBI,"Although this happened a decade ago, I am still ""beating"" myself over it and felt like I should get it off of my chest.
Back when I was 14, I was masturbating like no tomorrow. Once or twice a day for about two years, I would beat the meat in my bedroom and then proceed to ejaculate all over my carpet. I was a lazy kid and didn't keep a box of tissues in my room. I also liked to see how far I could shoot my cum, so being the sensible kid I was, I decided just spewing my load on our carpet was the best option. Let me point out that although we had carpet, it wouldn't become crusty or white or anything like that, so I wasn't worried about my parents seeing. When I was 14 we also had a cat who was 18 at the time and having some issues controlling his bladder. After two bouts of him pissing on our floor, my parents decided to find out where he was pissing, so they researched how to find out if your carpet has cat piss on it. They found out that under blacklight, cat pee glows in the dark. They ordered a blacklight off of the internet and then decided to scan all of our carpet right after the got the blacklight while I was at sleep away camp. When I got back the a week later my dad seemed off in the car back. Apparently while I was gone, they found that the cat had peed all over my room and decided it would be best for them to put him down while I was gone, to spare me the trauma of having to say goodbye when I came back, and also wanting to put him out of his suffering. I was sad at first, but then I thought that was a little strange since my beloved cat didn't hang out in my room very much because it was in the basement and quite cold. Wanting to see how bad it was, I waited until my parents went to sleep and went downstairs with the blacklight to check it out. My carpet had around 50 or so splotches of glowing stains on it and then it hit me. Those stains were my jizz. My parents must've thought it was cat pee and put the cat down before I could explain what it was. I was overwhelmed with guilt and sadness, but eventually when I was older, realized it wasn't entirely my fault. To this day I have told no one, so this feels real good to get off of my chest.
TL;DR: I was came all over my floor. Parents mistook it for cat pee and put my cat down.
Note: Sorry for bad grammar and run-on sentences.

**EDIT: I understand some of you are very mad at my parents for putting my cat down, and based off of the information, are rightfully so. Before Ben (the cat I accidentally killed) was put down, we had another cat named Otis. Otis was put down for a very similar reason to Ben. He, like Ben, had troubles controlling his bladder and would go all over our house. After a month of cleaning up cat pee and watching him suffer in rather obvious pain, we decided it would be best to put him down. I am assuming it seemed rather obvious to my parents that Ben was probably going through the same ordeal as Otis and they decided it would be best to put him down. Some of you are also asking how my parents mistook my jizz stains for cat pee. I had a spot to the right of my closet that I usually did the deed at, so overtime, I came in approximately the same place almost every time. I kinda looked like a meteorite strewn field or something, and I can easily see how it was mistaken for cat pee. They must've thought the other spots were excess pee after the main spray or something like that. For those of you asking how disgusting I was to cum all over my carpet, I was a horny pubescent fourteen year old boy. When I was jacking, I was thinking more with my hormones than my brain, so I must've just gone ""Fuck it"" and came everywhere. Now I realize how disgusting this is and haven't came on my floor in probably nine years. Anyway, I am happy to answer any messages you send me, so fire away. I will answer everyone, I PROMISE. Oh yeah and HOLY SHIT GUYS FRONT PAGE! That's awesome and I thank everyone who upvoted, commented, and even downvoted.**"
2dfoqt,non_TBI,"So let's set the scene. My girlfriend has been away working. While away working, she got a kidney infection. She had to work through it and when she got home, she found out her dog was being put down. Now this is traumatic enough. But she was also misdiagnosed by the doctor, who gave her the wrong antibiotics. A weekend of sever stomach pain and crankyness passed. Then after getting the right antibiotics on Monday, she goes home to relax, stands up from the couch, and breaks her foot. Off to the hospital she goes. I spend the whole day at the hospital, the whole evening with her, trying to console her. She can't visit her sister and best friend in London. Very distraught. The next day I embark on a mission to cheer her up. I decide to bring her down my laptop and hard drive so we can watch movies. Typical wet Irish summer day and I slip and fall on my laptop. The LCD display of my 1,200 euro Samsung Laptop is obliterated. Ah well. No Movies. I decide to hang at her house and help her mind her nephew. Me and the nephew begin roughhousing and I end up swinging the boy of six full force into Girlfriends cast. Tears. Shouting. Shrieking. Door slamming. House-kicking-out-of. I leave the area for a few hours and return with plans for a surprise trip to the cinema. Surprise trip is going well! Tensions are low, and lovey-dovey-ness is up. As the movie starts she finishes off a text and I playfully knock her Google Nexus. Nexus decides to engage jet mode and crash onto the sticky popcorn riddled floor of the cinema. Cue the longest three seconds of my life as she reaches to the phone and flips it over. The screen has shattered gloriously, great arks of darkness spread across the display. I have destroyed her phone. She refuses to speak to me for the whole film. And for most of the car journey home. I leave her house, after a half-assed goodbye, I was afraid of damaging anything by staying too long. i also forgot mention thats she super stressed because today she recieves the test results that determine whether she goes to colleg or not. And she has no phone. To ring relatives. Or friends. Shes not talking to me. I fucked up.

tl/dr: I went full Retard on my maimed Girlfirend. 

UPDATE: This has kind of exploded in my opinion, thanks to all, Im glad I provided some laughter. To answer some questions, I gave her my phone last night and Im writing this on my Samsung laptop hooked up to a monitor. Also the phone has gone in for repairs and Im paying. Thanks to that dude for the awesome Sketch lol. Girlfriend did indeed get her course. So shes happy over that. Im meeting her at a party in a while and ill be sure to let ye know how this ends up. Thats if she makes it to the party. Fingers crossed. In fairness, shes an awesome chick, and Id love if the universe would rethink trying to split us up. Cheers Universe.

UPDATE 2: Confirmation coming soon. I aint no bullshitter.

UPDATE 3: Thursday morning now. I still cannot believe my luck continues. Well this really is my fault. Last night we tried to go clubbing, even with her foot. But i got absolutely nasty drunk. We got a taxi, I puked in it. Kicked out. She had to walk on crutches all the way home.Im pretty sure Ive been relived of boyfriend duties. Confirmation is on its way. I cant get any photos because she has my phone. I really feel like a piece of shit.

2ixh4n,non_TBI,"I was going to my local bank in order to get a replacement debit card. As soon as I enter the bank I begin to look at the cameras and vault access thinking of PayDay 2. I catch myself and continue to the desk and ask for my replacement debit card.

She tells me ""have a seat and someone will be with you shortly"". I get seated and I again see myself paying attention to employees using keys, entering the vault access, and myself viewing the cameras. I catch myself again and stop. I thought it would be funny to take a picture of the vault access with cameras watching it and sending it to a friend I play PayDay 2 with saying something like ""These GenSec cameras are everywhere"".

I ensured my phone's audio settings are set to silent. I then take a picture while trying to look non-suspicious. But it turns out that the setting on my Note 3's camera has a separate setting called ""Shutter Sound"". Need less to say it was enabled. The bank is having a slow day I assume, it was quiet. Then you hear this loud *shutter* noise! I did the opposite of what I should have, I freaked out and hide my phone. Looking nervous I can see the front desk lady looking at me and calling someone on the phone.

Sure enough the police show up and they take me into a conference room at the bank to ""talk"". The bank employees explain the story and the police ask why I've acted suspicious and took a picture. I felt really dumb, I explained the game and how I wanted to send it to my friend. They look at me like I'm retarded and say ""okay, please refrain from acting in this suspicious manner blah blah"". I'm thinking of moving to a new bank.

3dxc3p,non_TBI,"Before I start, I may aswell sum up mine and her relationship. Known each other since we were kids, had a great friendship, had a few times we tried dating here and there, none really worked out. Still amazing friends, I ended up dating her bestfriend for 2 years before splitting with her 9 months ago...  And now I've just slept with her. Let's call her Cee.


So anyway, literally just happened just over 24 hours ago. Was out on Saturday afternoon, decided to go hang out with Cee. We are both nearly 20 now, so it's safe to say it's been a while knowing each other. She invites me out to a family bbq, to which I say ""why not"" as I've nothing else planned for the weekend. Cee and I have had chemistry over the years but since we had grown up I thought it wouldn't cause any dramas


Fast forward to the night, we decide to get ""shit faced"" because we have not yet been drunk together, which is strange for us (believe me). Bear in mind this is the girl who tells me about everyone she's slept with, what she liked, dislike... I know everything about her. I'm like the gay bestfriend yet... Not gay. Anyway, we are getting drunk, I'm enjoying the night and so is she, then it starts getting a bit heated. She appears to be trying to kiss me with her family around (again, family known for a good time so I was a bit antsy), to which she suggests I stay at hers on the sofa! Woohey! Haven't gotta go home pissed, result! 


Fast forward to midnight, her friends giving us a lift home, we stumble in (by this time we had been all over each other), lay on the sofa... Then the unthinkable happens... Cee and I just begin to lay down together and we start going down on each other... One thing lead to another and we are fucking like the high school lovers you see in any nsfw college porn clip. I won't lie and say it wasn't good... It was great, but almost immediately after... she started crying... She was getting upset and not long after, she asked me to leave... So there I am, walking the 40 minute journey home with a cock trying to escape my jeans, thinking what on earth did I do to do wrong, feeling like I've hurt her or, insulted her or something, feeling like a giant sack of shit.


Now it's Monday, we have barely spoken, and I'm paranoid I've hurt her. I think she feels that I'm going to fall deeply in love with her (which won't happen), and she's scared it will ruin this great friendship.... Any advice redditors? 


Throwaway for obvious reasons.


TLDR: Fucked best girl friend of 12 years, she cried, walk of shame home at 2am with my dick trying to gasp for fresh air.

UPDATE: Decided to message her, just the casual ""how you feeling?"" kind of thing... She's just received it (messenger thank you), we shall find out soon, wish me luck...

UPDATE2: So... I'm not sure if it's what I expected but after a bit of chatting, she seems alright. Funnily enough we have thrown a few jokes about it out there already... Still not sure what made her upset though, but she definitely seems better. Will see how the convo goes... Sitting in my car at the moment so apologies for the typing...

UPDATE3: So.... Took the plunge, grew a pair, and called her... Had to find out why she was upset and make sure all was smooth. Brought up the question, she seemed a bit annoyed with herself but anyway... She said she's happy it happened, and enjoyed it,  but she was upset it happened in the way it did (took us both getting drunk). Although I agree... I asked her was that it (I know we have had some form of serial tension for years... It was bound to happen but I wasn't sure this was just the reason...)

So... She explained that a guy she had liked for a while (that I knew of, well I knew she talked about him a bit)... She feels she is actually falling for him and feels that me & her sleeping together may of ruined this. She said she felt so guilty that she rang hin the second I left... I said to her that, she's not cheated, and all is cool between us... I encouraged her to give him a call after I hangup, she clearly likes him, I'm gutted that she feels upset with it. Ended the chat with saying I'll be there to support her regardless... And said she shouldn't feel bad because her and this guy aren't even togrther. I think she's fallen for him, and fallen hard... I feel like I've cocked this up? I'd rather just see her happy...

UPDATE4: Mixed messages on here have driven me nuts. I'm going over there to find out what's actually going on in her head, hoping she can be honest to my face if she's not so far. Wish me luck.

UPDATE5: Home sweet home... Right, time to sum it all up. So, some more info on the story anyway, she is at uni, lives about... 140 miles from me (when she's there), but she's home for the summer. This new guy is the guy she's spent her first year of uni, basically with.

Anyway, enough of that. Finally met with her face to face. Literally just said, ""Look, be honest with me, are you being truely honest with me or are you wanting me to chase you""... kinda thing. Anyway, she said she'd thought about us getting together, but it'd be too confusing (trust me, we're trainwrecks by default). We know each other inside out, quite frankly she knows my next move before I do and it scares the shit out of me. I'm not sure dating her would do either of us good, but fuck it, we'll probably end up together.

She did clarify a few things for me. She feels like an asshole for asking me to leave, she thinks her step dad overheard (yikes!), and she doesn't remember some of the funny parts. Other than that, we literally just laughed about the whole thing. Laughed it off. Look guys, I appreciate those saying ""She clearly wants you"", but as far as I'm concerned, if she's cool with it so am I. We always get on each others nerves anyway. We'll see how her new boyfriend/maybe/whatever he is pans out, and hey ho... it might go to shit! Who knows, but at least she's being cool with the whole thing, and honestly I'm cool with it too.

Oh, also, she kind of admitted to me that she knows she can just click her fingers and get me whenever she wants. OP needs to grow a pair and stop that."
2lgsmz,non_TBI,"So this happened last year but I thought I could still share.

So it was finals week and for my English class, we had to give a business presentation. It was the morning of the presentation and I had stayed up really late preparing for it. Every morning I take Vyvanse to help with my ADD, so just like every other day I took one. I also have one of those weekly pill organizers that I keep my vitamins in so I took those too and I headed to campus. I went straight to the library to practice and get some coffee. I got an ""Eye Opener"" which is a large coffee with extra espresso in it. I sit down and start drinking the coffee and start going over my notes. I notice my palms are pretty sweaty but I just assume it is from being nervous. Then my feet start to sweat. Then my armpits. Then I realize what happened. When I filled my vitamin container the night before, I decided to put my Vyvnase in there to make it easier. I have now taken 80mg of Vyvanse (when I normally take 40mg) and have had about 4 cups of coffee worth of caffeine. I have ingested enough stimulants to kill a small horse. 

It has been about 2 hours now and the Vyvanse and coffee are in full affect. I am sweating so bad that when I walk my feet slide around in my shoes and the tips of my fingers were blue because the sweat is causing the blue lines on my notebook paper to come off. I was in the fucking zone and was so hyped up about this presentation. It's time to go give my presentation so I put my headphones on and start blasting some hardstyle music because that is obviously a good idea when you have to calmly give a presentation. I get to glass and realize the grading rubric I was holding is now ruined. My sweaty hands have smeared the ink all over the paper and it's starting to get wrinkly from being wet  but I still have to give it to my professor. He looks at it and says ""Did this get wet?"" I looked at him and said ""HAH! Gotta do whatcha gotta do."" I sit back down and wait to give my presentation to the class.  Freakout mode is now fully engaged and I want to do everything in the world. I start coming up with designs for a new aquarium filter that I assure myself I can make millions on. My mind is all over the place. My name gets called and I pretty much run to the front of the room and start getting people excited like I am about to give a sermon to a 5,000 person mega church.  ""Y'ALL READY TO HEAR THIS PRESENTATION?!"" My partner gets the presentation up and I decide to say fuck the intro we planned, I need to motivate these people so they will like our business idea. ""IMAGINE STAYING IN A BUNGALOW ON THE COAST OF THAILAND WITHOUT A WORRY IN THE WORLD. BUT HOW WILL YOU GET THE MONEY TO DO THAT, RIGHT? I'LL TELL YOU. BY OWNING ONE OF OUR PORTABLE SMOOTHIE STANDS AND HAVING SOMEONE OPERATE IT FOR YOU! YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY WORK. IT'S LIKE FREE MONEY."" This has now gone from a presentation on our fake company to a full blown sales pitch that was a mix between a Billy Mays commercial and a Vector Marketing pitch. My partner takes control of things and gets us on the right track. When it is my turn to speak again, I open my mouth and it is so dry I could barely speak. My lips kept getting stuck together and I kept accidentally whistling. I somehow managed to make it through the rest of the presentation and immediately left to go get a drink. I got my rubric back after the end of class. I am normally very quiet in class so I guess I caught my professor off guard because he wrote ""Who was that?"" in the comments section. 

Next time, I will double check my pills before taking them.

TL;DR: Ingested enough stimulants to kill a heard of moose and then tried turning my final presentation into some sort of crazy sales pitch but still got an A.

EDIT:To the people saying that I am being dishonest about acting like this because 80mg is a prescribed amount, medicine affects people differently. A few people are saying ""well I take 70mg and don't act like this"". How you act on 70mg has no correlation to how other people may act on 70mg. Try doubling your dosage and ingesting 3 times the amount of caffeine you normally do, I promise that you will act very different.

2jfbbi,non_TBI,"I have four children I have to get out the door every morning for school. It's a struggle everyday and I can say with confidence that it doesn't get better from PreK to 5th grade, crossing my fingers for 6th grade...but that aside.

My darling son is almost 5 and is adamantly opposed to wearing underwear. His father compromised, saying he didn't have to wear his little Ninja Turtle briefs to bed. But when you give a kid an inch, they always take a mile. This morning, my son claims that he doesn't have to do what his mother says because, ""My Dad doesn't wear underwear!"" Kid, I've been washing your father' broke down skivvies for over a decade....he most definitely wears underwear. I tell him to get his butt upstairs and put them on. And that was the last on the subject, as I was in a rush so I didn't check to make sure he did it, but apparently he did not do as I said.

Flash forward to early afternoon at B&N, little dude is not acting as he should in the checkout line. I get up to pay and he runs away, I chase him down, and stomp back to the counter angrily muttering that he'll never play Minecraft ever again. I plunk him on the ground next to me and his pants hit the ground showing the cashier, every person in the sizable line, and poor innocent little girls my sons cash and prizes. My son thinks is HILARIOUS and starts cracking up laughing and screaming,""I don't wear underwear!"" I quickly pay and escape the judging faces..we are now sitting in the food court while I'm typing this on my Ipad. He's playing Minecraft and I'm a terrible parent.


ETA: I made it to the front page of Reddit!Thank you for allowing my kid and I to gain some Internet notoriety. I guess it's time that I say, yes, I shouldn't have given him the kindle to play with. I was flustered and embarrassed, so I wasn't thinking clearly. We all have our moments and fuck ups as parents. I know I'm doing just fine all around, he reads and writes way above his age level and is a sweet and empathetic little boy.

Looks like I also have to add that my kid didn't intentionally drop his pants, my watch pulled them down as I was placing him on the floor.

I will accept any parenting advice on how to get him to stop sucking his fingers...I am definitely at my wits end there.

3jxt5q,non_TBI,"Every single time I ask my girlfriend what she wants to eat it becomes like this big fucking grand debate. [This scene from the notebook pretty accurately illustrates us every night.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmivKyEY1Dk) With her birthday rolling around I decided I should kill two birds with one stone...

So I spent a month building her a glorious app as a present. This thing is my fucking masterpiece. You give it money and it will go out and order you delivery. Thing is, you don't know what you're getting. Some guy just shows up with some food. You could get some pad thai, you could get a rare steak with a side of cat, who knows? No decisions, no problems. It was perfect, or at least I thought so.

The morning of her birthday arrived (this morning) and after some sexy time I presented her with her gift. She loved it, and after plenty of laughs suggested that we use it at her birthday party tonight. Her birthday party rolled around and a large group of us drunkenly placed the first order ever with the app for ~200$ of food. We were hysterical about the thought of what the hell would show up at the door... But after an hour I started to get a bit worried that no food had arrived. Finally we got a call from Pablo the delivery driver!

Turns out I forgot one minor (major) detail: picking your address. I hard coded in an address I knew would get delivery at any hour while making the app… So while Pablo the delivery guy was sitting outside of 350 5th Ave, New York aka the fucking Empire State Building, wondering where to drop off $200 worth of Peruvian chicken… I was sitting inside my apartment in the middle of Kansas wondering how the hell I’m going to feed my 10 drunk hungry friends. Fuck.

**tldr: made a shit delivery app. placed order for gf's bday party. Delivery guy in NY, but i live in Kansas.**

**edit: reading through all of your guys's comments has made me seriously consider making this thing in to a reality. I honestly think I'd need to start from scratch though considering the atrocity that is my current code base. At least this time around I'll have the design that /u/awkwwward offered. Check this thread back in like 1-2 months and I'll keep you updated!**"
2wvdpv,non_TBI,"EDIT: Obligatory ""this didn't happen today"", it happened last night. Close enough.

So I came home from work yesterday, ate dinner, and went on Reddit. I checked the subs I normally do, like NoSleep, AskReddit, Jokes, stuff like that. Usually I save TIFU for last because it's the most entertaining.

I started reading all of the TIFU's. After the front page was exhausted, I looked at ""new"". [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2wtnj7/tifu_by_forwarding_this_message_to_my_entire/) popped up and I clicked on the link in the text post. In case you guys don't know, the link contains an image of a black dude with a gigantic dick.

Right at this moment, my dad just chooses to walk by (I'm 16, by the way). He saw the image of the black dude. After this, he went into his room and didn't come out for a while. Later, he gave me this talk.

""Look, it's okay if you're gay. You didn't have to try to close the window when I walked by. I support you 100 percent, but try not to look at porn all the time, okay?""

Thanks, Reddit.

1s5qhe,non_TBI,"Now, this may cause some transatlantic confusion, but Faggots is the name of a popular dish where I'm from - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(food)

Anyway, last week I bought a pack of Mr Brain's Frozen Pork Faggots (along with some marrowfat peas, of course), and as I have Thursday (today at the time of writing) completely off from Uni, I was going to have them as a little treat. Here's a picture - http://uk-img1.ciao.com/iuk/images/products/normal/376/product-5303376.jpg

Unfortunately they take a good while to cook in the oven, so I preheat it for 10 minutes and then put them in for 45 (as per the cooking instructions). I live in a three storey house (not that big, it's actually quite narrow) with some other students, and was upstairs in my bedroom as my food was cooking.

I had heard good things about Bob's Burgers, so I was watching the first few episodes when the smell started to waft from my dreams and into my nostrils. I ran downstairs and, thinking I was alone in the house, shouted ""Mmm-mmm! It sure smells like Faggots in here!""

My housemate was sitting on the sofa.

His Spanish boyfriend was in the kitchen.

Now, I have nothing against homosexuality. If two consenting adults want to do the moist macarena, then I don't really care about the configuration.

My housemate (from that London), although initially horrified, understood the misunderstanding. The Spaniard, however, went ballistic. They are a fast talking people when relaxed, so you can imagine the speed at which he was undoubtedly spreading half-truths about my mother. One of the few Spanish words I know is 'puta', so I understood, like, 30% of what he was all up in my face about. Eventually, my housemate managed to calm him down, but the Spanish Stink-Eye is a terrifying thing to suffer.


Edit: I was robbed of fuck up of the week. ROBBED!!! http://i.imgur.com/ys1OVpa.gif

2ak7pl,non_TBI,"This actually happened earlier in the week. 

I went to the Dentist Office to have two cavities filled by a super cute brunette dentist.  I had just been numbed up with Novocaine and she came back in when I was drooling all over myself.  She tells me to open my mouth so I do and she's sitting behind my head looking down.  I noticed her breasts pressed up against my shaved head.  Strangely I found this arousing as the office was cold and I could feel nipples. The whole time she's working in my mouth I'm thinking ""Don't get hard"".  Well after about 10 minutes of her boobs mashed against the back of my head I got a boner.  She actually notices it because she stops working on my teeth and giggles.  I notice what she is looking at and it's the tent that had sprouted in my pants.  I apologize incoherently with drool all over the place.  She giggles again and tells me not to worry about it.  She goes back to work on my teeth again with boobs mashed against my head.  

I have an awesome dentist.   

Thanks for the big response!  I wasn't expecting this.  This is the biggest response I've ever received!"
33e8nk,non_TBI,"Ok, background info start! I'm a guy. I have a pretty androgynous body. I'm 17, a little below average height, and I'm extremely skinny. You can literally see almost all the bones in my body through my skin. (I'm not anorexic, I eat more than most of my friends, I just have a super fast metabolism.) Where I've been mistaken as a girl there twice by customers. One last thing, I have a cute childhood friend that I'd pretty much do anything for, let's call her, Asia.


Obligatory ""this didn't actually happen today, lol."" It happened not too long ago though. Asia is a girl that takes fashion super seriously, and I'm pretty sure she'll end up in the fashion industry later. Asia took a class that allowed her to conduct our high school's fashion show that is shown to the entirety of the school during a 'faff around all day' day that happens once per year at our school near the end of the year.


So, about a month before the fashion show, Asia texts me, desperately needing my help, because one of her models (a student that SIGNED UP TO BE IN THE FASHION SHOW) quit on her, and she now doesn't have enough male models. Now, this is where the fu starts. I agree thinking, whats the worst that could happen? I mean, I'm not ugly. (I think....) Once I agree, she tells me I need to go down to a nearby city and get measurements done for the suits I will wear during the show. 


The next day, I drive down there, and I find the store after about 20 minutes of being lost, because I'm a hopeless hick, and can't find my own ass without GPS. I walk in, and kind of stare at people, because I don't know what I'm doing, since I've never done this before. About 3 employees walk up to me and ask what I need. (I was wearing all black that day, maybe not my best choice.) Once they finally understand that I need measurements of my body taken, they walk me to the back, where some other employees are. I tell them what school I'm from, and some woman walks up and immediately starts taking my measurements. She verbally conveys them to a man sitting down, and he writes them down. I wasn't really paying attention, until she said something along the lines of, ""bust, 30."" (I don't remember the exact measurements.) At this point, I had a feeling she thought I was female.


After all my measurements are down, she grabs the paper with my measurements, and walks into a large closet. She reappears after a minute or so, with a light pink dress. At this point, I was too nervous to correct their error. She tells me to go and try it on in the nearby changing room. I took the dress, and I put it on. (It covered my legs, thank christ; nobody was going to see my hairy legs. To this day I question why I put it on. I think it was to save face at this point.) I come out, and the girl tells me I'm very pretty. (yay?) She then asks me if it fits ok, and I tell her yes. It strangely was a perfect fit despite my lack of bust. The man that took down my measurements looked at me strangely, and I think he either realized I was a guy... or was infatuated. After I got the dress off and got home I promptly texted Asia that I had gotten my measurements taken, and I took a nap, and forgot the whole ordeal. 


Fast forward to the day of fashion show.


Asia texts me, telling me something was wrong. For some reason the clothing with my name attached to it only consisted of dresses. My stomach tied itself into a Windsor knot. I told her what had happened 1 month prior, and she laughed super hard, but when she stopped laughing, she looked me straight in the face and told me what was going to happen. ""Michelle, and Daniel are the same height, and roughly have the same body shape, so she can wear his suits, but, you.... there are no suits that could fit you, and we need 8 people to take part in the show for the final picture. Go home right now. Shave every part of your body, except for your head, make sure your junk is tied down.""


I did as Asia instructed, I came back, put on the strangely familiar pink dress in the faculty bathroom, cuz there ain't no way in hell I was putting that thing on in the guys bathroom. Asia put some makeup on my face, and tied the dress's extra ribbons onto me, and damn, I actually looked pretty cute. The other male models didn't realize who I was with Asia's makeup on me. One of the female models was giggling though. She knew... SHE KNEW. I turned bright red, and ran back to the faculty bathroom. Asia had to drag me out, she told me that, ""THE SHOW HAS TO GO ON!"" So I did it. I had to go arm in arm with another guy, go down a makeshift runway in the middle of the lunchroom, smile, turn around, and walk back. I had to do this 3 different times, in 3 different dresses. Every time the crowd was clapping and whatnot, so I eventually got sort of confident. Finally, the show had ended, and it was time to take the picture, we all got onto the runway, we posed, and... the unthinkable happened. Somebody in the crowd yells, ""THE GIRL IN PINK, IS THAT RICHARD?!"" I turn bright red again, the picture gets taken, and I sprint off into the bathroom, to get the damn thing off.



In the following days, nobody came up and said a word to me about it, but then the yearbook came out, and in the exact center of the book, page 40 or whatever, there was a full sized picture (it covered page 39 and 40) of the fashion show, and there I was, in a pink dress. Immortalized forever. Worst part? This wasn't my final year of high school, and now I have a fan club. :I


**TLDR: I'm beta af, got mistaken for a girlie, put on a pink dress for a friend, and got called out for it infront of my entire high school.**




*Update!* I texted Asia, she said she can get me the picture tomorrow. She doesn't have the yearbook either, but she has *all* the pictures on a flash drive. Be patient, and I'll post the picture once I get it :)


Edit: Thanks to whoever popped my gold cherry! It means a lot :3 and don't worry, it's currently very early in the morning here, so it's probably going to take under 12 hours for me to get that picture.

*Another Update:* Asia is currently at school, she'll probably get me the picture at around 10-11 PM UTC. If she gets it to me while I'm at work, I won't be able to upload it until 3 AM UTC tomorrow. Hold tight guys.

*Second to last update:* Asia is not responding to my text messages, last time she responded to my texts was 12 hours ago. I'll go down to my high school tomorrow and see if the teacher she had has the pictures. If not, then there is a very small chance I'll be able to find the picture. I don't know why you guys are getting so worked up about it, it's really nothing special; since I'll have to black out the faces, you won't be able to see much."
2huw1j,non_TBI,"The following is going to be gross, and I apologize: For the past weeks, every few bowel movements I have noticed some weird blood mixed in with the feces. Obviously I took this as a bad sign, and made an appointment with a doctor. I was told to bring a stool sample. 

My doctors appointment was after work today. So in the fridge, in my lunch bag, I had two tupperware containers. One was my stool sample, the other was leftover chinese food. 

On a lot of days at work I tend to drink a bit to get through the day. I have some vodka in my water bottle. I never get plastered or even drunk, but I like to maintain a nice buzz. A steady buzz really helps you through the shift and dissolves the stress. Also makes me much more sociable and likeable with my co-workers. On days when I am not buzzed people tend to ask me ""what's wrong?"" or remark that I am quieter than usual. I kind of need that buzz. 

For whatever reason, maybe nerves about the doctors appointment, I overdid it with the drinking today. 

When I went on my lunch break I was drunk. I was also wearing headphones. So I was just kind of spaced out. Drunk, lost in the haze of the music, etc. My mind was elsewhere as I prepared my lunch. 

I left to go to the bathroom while my food was microwaving. I get back to the kitchen and I see people gathered around the microwave with looks of revulsion on their face. It is then that I am hit with a putrid odor. In horror, I stumbled toward the microwave and saw that I had microwaved my stool sample. 

Not only had it heated up, but some of it had exploded and coated the interior of the microwave with boiling shit. Somebody threw up in the trash can. 

I stuttered some sort of excuse about microwaving the wrong thing, and reached in to try to grab the container, but I dropped it on the floor. Then I threw up. When I looked up again people were staring at me with horror and disgust. I was physically overwhelmed with a terrible sensation of dread and shame. I grabbed paper towels to try to clean, but I was no longer functioning on any real mental level and just sort of stood there shaking. 

At some point somebody came alone who was very polite, but clearly trying in a very forced way to hide their disturbance, and they said I could go home. Instead I just sat on a bench in the parking lot for a few hours. 

I think I will quit my job. If I'm not already fired. How I can face these people again is incomprehensible. No, it isn't possible. It will have to be a new job for me. Not to mention a new doctor. I can never explain why I missed my appointment. "
2uvj6f,non_TBI,"So I got my usual coffee to banish the last vestiges of slumber and sat at my desk, feeling generally ok. I had a breakfast of yogurt and lots of almonds and walnuts and was feeling kinda full. As I sat down, steaming coffee in my hands, I felt a earth moving rumble in my stomach and tried to ignore it. It continued, and I kept shuffling in my seat. Eventually, a piccolo of flatus escaped, tiny sound but pungent aroma. Within a few seconds, my co-worker turns over to me and asks what that smell is. I freeze up, shamed and embarrassed. He says, ""is that the coffee, it smells amazing...it smells like fresh hazelnuts"" and proceeds to inhale deeply, several times. I have to work with him for the rest of my time here, and I can't really take him seriously anymore.

TL;DR let out a nutty fart at work and watched, in horror, as my co-worker inhaled the 'divine' aroma

3d58a4,non_TBI,"Pretty much for my entire life, since I was a child I've loved bologna. One of my favorite things was always a peanut butter & bologna sandwich. However much I loved the taste of bologna though, I always dreaded eating the red band around the bologna. I thought it was a part of the bologna! Nobody ever told me that it wasn't, sadly. Every time I would eat it, also, I would soon thereafter have stomach pains. But I loved the taste so much, so that was an okay tradeoff I guess.

Anyways, I'm 25 now, and a few weeks ago I was making me one of my beloved PB&J + Bologna sandwiches within presence of a friend of mine. After making it, they're like, ""What the hell? You eat the plastic?"" And I was stunned. I was like, what the hell are you talking about? They told me that it was plastic around the bologna and not to eat it. I removed it, and was absolutely amazed at how much better it tasted. Ever since, I can actually eat bologna without the stomach aches that accompany it. I feel embarrassed that I didn't learn this until a quarter of a century of my life. I had to share, because stupidity sells.

**TL;DR: Didn't know the red stuff was plastic, have been eating it, dealing with stomach problems. Learned it wasn't, love bologna even better now.**

**Edit:** A cool group of people made this into a short clip on YouTube to watch! It's pretty much on point with how this occurred. [Watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUEVN88GSUM). Thank you, /u/mermaident!"
2ufu4g,non_TBI,"Okay so obligatory 'this didn't happened today it was a few months ago'. 

I was seeing this guy and he had this beautiful house. His kitchen had these polished granite counter-tops and a marble floor and a big fancy breakfast bar thing etc. So one morning we're in the kitchen making breakfast and we decide to get a bit dirty, so I bend over the kitchen counter and he puts his dick in my ass to start doing me from behind. We didn't use lube cause it was kinda a spur of the moment thing, and so it was a pretty tight squeeze getting his dick into my asshole but we just kinda went with it and he starts doing me from behind. Literally only like 30-40 seconds of banging and he starts screaming and I feel my ass and legs are kinda wet. Turns out my ass was so tight and the friction was so much from the lack of lubrication that his frenulum had snapped and there was blood gushing EVERYWHERE. I go to spin round quickly to see what's happening, stand on the bloody marble floor and slip and whack my head hard against the granite counter, knocking myself out. I come to and I'm naked on the cold floor with blood in my hair and on my hands and body and he's on the phone calling paramedics, dick totally flaccid and dripping blood everywhere. 
The paramedics get there and we both have to go to the hospital; him to get his busted dick checked out and me to get my head checked out. Turns out I gave myself concussion from the head injury. 
So, all we wanted some morning kitchen fun, but instead his banjo string snaps and I slip on his boner blood and knock myself out. All because we didn't bother with lube. 

**Edit: thank you for the gold!! hope all your penises stay nice and unbroken.**"
22ng9n,non_TBI,"So today I got a little over excited about some new almond milk iced coffee I bought and because it's been 90 degrees at 8:00 am where I live and this stuff is so damn delicious I chugged two large glasses, with this I also had a nice yogurt and was out the door. I was feeling great today, I had just bought a new pair of short shorts. They're sheer and billowy so I just threw on a little nude thong underneath. For lunch I grabbed a huge sandwich with a friend, she didn't want her pickles (this place makes their own and they're AWESOME) so I happily scarfed down a huge amount with my lunch. 10 minutes later I was driving home and start to get that familiar rumble in my stomach signaling I might need to make da poopy pretty soon, but I could wait. Within 5 minutes that rumble turned into an INTENSE cramping, the kind that makes you break out in a cold sweat, my hands were shaking and I was starting to see double. I was about 10 minutes from my house. I floored it as the cramping intensified. Just as I rounded the corner to my street, shit started reverse raping my poor virgin asshole in a violent poo-nami. Tears flowed from my eyes as diarrhea flowed from my ass. But not just any diarrhea, it's like my digestive system literally forgot it had to digest those pickles and my poop could be described as nothing less than the feeling of swabbing my tender balloon knot with a red hot branding iron. I was sobbing hysterically while pulling into my driveway as I had now ruined my shorts and car seat. I frantically dashed from my car and ran directly into the mailman, his face instantly went pale as he noticed putrid coffee pickle shit seeping through my shorts, my thong not doing a thing to stop it, I burst into tears again and ran to my bathroom where I ripped my shorts and panties off and started trying to clean myself up. I thought I had suffered enough now...but no, the gods were still angry for as I weakly reached for some summers eve wipes (vagina wipes to keep your lady bits smelling like flowers) But I accidentally grabbed some makeup remover wipes that are essentially just napkins soaked in salicylic acid. Now, for those of you that have never put salicylic acid on your face it fucking BURNS. Now, imagine having shit razor blades and fire and bleach and having the equivalent of an open wound (MY VAGINA) and rubbing those acid wipes ALL OVER YOUR DOWNSTAIRS. I began screaming as the pain immediately hit me. I crawled into the shower and sat spread eagle on the floor furiously rubbing my poor puss and tush. My labia turned bright red and my ass never stopped stinging. I dragged myself like a dog with broken legs to my bed and am now lying naked with a pillow crammed between my legs praying for the pain and misery to end. 

**EDIT:**Hey thanks for the gold, man. Glad you felt my burning crotch and ass was worth it, and as for an update: I used ""anti-icky-poo"" to clean my car seats, threw away my shorts and underwear, and the swelling in my labia went down. It's still a little uncomfortable to sit in certain positions but I think I'm going to make it!"
2kwin3,non_TBI,"This morning I was getting late to a meeting, so I decided to hit the gas a bit harder than usual. Before I know, I'm over-speeding on the highway. Not by much, about 10mph over the speeding limit. Two minutes later I hear the sirens behind my car and stop on the sides of the road.  
  
""You know why I stopped you sir?"" the officer asks.  
""Let me be honest with you officer, I have a _really_ important meeting now, one that can change my life, and I'm late. Since I have no previous traffic felony or accident I took a calculated and responsible civilian decision to speed up a notch above the limit""  
""Well, that's not an excuse sir, you may be risking yourself and other people lives."" He said, took my license and went to check my driving history.  
  
""Well"" he said when coming back ""you are clean and we wouldn't want to change it. Be careful and DO NOT go over the speeding limit again, the law is there for a reason. It doesn't matter how good of driver you are.""  
I was _so_ relived and happy with the officer's decision and not getting a speeding ticket, that I immediately reached to my pocket, pulled $20, and tried to hand it to the officer.  
""What are you doing sir?""  
""I..I'm tipping you for your service officer""  
""You are what?! Sir you do realise this is an attempted bribery?!""  
""No... I'm just... Just wanted to tip you for a good service. For a moment I had in mind... So sorry, my bad!""  
""Sir I'm a public servant, not employee in a private company. I do not receive tips. For your information this can be treated as an attempted bribery.""  
""Deepest apologies officer, I'm slow and stupid in mornings. Really meant it in a good way""  
""Let it never happen again _in your life_. Have a good day sir.""  
  
I'm stupid sometimes."
3hlo02,non_TBI,"This actually happened yesterday evening at about 6:00pm. Some friends and I were shooting empty beer cans up on the roof of my house with a BB gun (the classic [Daisy Red Ryder](http://www.daisy.com/node/1)). I accidentally cut open the bottom of my foot on a piece of metal paneling, so I got off the roof to grab a bandage. When I came back outside, the first thing I heard was “put your fucking hands up!” and a semi-automatic rifle barrel was pointed at my face. Then about a dozen more cops raided my house and backyard from all sides, pointing their handguns at us while my friends and I stood there frozen and confused with our hands high in the air. Turns out someone was driving by and saw us standing on the roof with what appeared to be a rifle, and the cops thought we were on a shooting rampage. Luckily I live in Canada so no real bullets were fired.

TL;DR – Got raided by the local police force for shooting cans on my roof with a BB gun."
2ficq8,non_TBI,"So this all takes place last week Friday night. My girlfriend was 38 weeks pregnant and we were both waiting for her to burst anytime now. That night we watched some Breaking Bad and passed out. In the middle of the night she wakes me up by giving me oral. So she throws down for a few minutes and decides to get on top of me, which by the way I'm not to fond of because of her being pregnant and all. Also my girl is a squirter and things get pretty wet. As she is riding me all of a sudden it's as if a waterfall came out of her. As I lay there swimming in this warm fluid it never occurred to me that this could be out of the norm. Finally she got off because she noticed it too. So I jump up to grab a towel, which is a necessary when having sex, and flip on the lights to asses the situation. That's when I see that her water broke with my dick inside her and I have some kind of amniotic sac membranes all over my man mane. I flip out and start dry heaving profusely. All the while my girlfriend is laughing her ass off. Also the fact that I'm being cocked blocked by a unborn baby. Thus started a trip to the hospital. "
2yt0ls,non_TBI,"This happened about an hour ago while I was at work.

A little bit of a back story. I'm currently in the military and as such, they are fairly harsh on HR complaints. Particularly those concerning EO. 

A buddy of mine, we'll call him John, and I were walking through the base to get some redbull's. (Shameless plug.) We passed by a TV playing the story of the two officers in Ferguson, MO who were shot yesterday. 

Now John is from that area, he feels very very strongly towards what has happened in the past year in that area of the country. John is dark. I mean, midnight on a moonless night dark skinned. That is not a racial remark, mearly a physical attribute, and not the FU. As we walked by he stopped and shook his head. We've talked about the events in length before and both agree the first situation could have been handled better. Now before you start saying your opinion, please understand we are like brothers. I mean we've been in the shit together, rounds poppin' off close. Because of this we make fun of eachother non-stop. You have to to get through certain aspects of life and nothing is offlimits to our jovial quips. 

After watching it for a second, I look at him and say, ""See what your people did? They done capped two cops!"" My intention was because he's from that area, to the 5 other darker complected individuals who were standing near enough to hear me and didn't know his background, my sheet white skinned comment came across COMPLETELY differently. 

Now here I sit, waiting to be yelled at and corrected for racial remarks and words or actions inciting a riot. (No pun intended.) The worst part? He could not stop laughing long enough while I was getting yelled at initially to come to my defense BECAUSE i was getting yelled at. 

If you're reading this John, thanks man. I appreciate the back up.

TL:DR Joked about a place: came out about race.

Edit: Some kind gentleman, or lady w/ deeeeeep voice, was nice enough to narrate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgSDD3VAaHs

Edit 2: Wow front page! Who'd have known race is a hot button topic?!?! Oh yeah, everyone who reports the news. That's right.... Thanks all for the support. The ass-chewing wasn't too bad, the higher ups yelled at me and gave me the ""we expect more from a leader in your position... you teach EO how could you?..... "" Finally at my turn to talk, I explained the situation and promptly had a room full of 'tops' laughing in my face and told me to be mindful of where I am, what I say, and who's around. Walked away with a Page 11/13/article 15 depending on your branch and a sore ass (again no pun intended with no more DADT).

Edit 3:EO = Equal Opportunity, HR = Human Resources, MO - Missouri, TV = television, FU = fuck up. Hope that helps all who don't/didn't understand. 
"
3mfw21,non_TBI,"A couple of years ago I had a friends with benefits situation going on with a girl in my office.

We'd hooked up a couple of times over at her place, but it was clear that this wasn't going to be a ""relationship"".  However, if we aren't seeing anyone else, then why not bang?  We both wanna bang somebody, right?  You banging anyone?  No?  Me either.  Lets do it.

It was that kind of thing.

Anyway, at this particular time, we hadn't really talked in about a month.  It had been a long week and I'd just arrived home late on Friday night.  I had no plans.

I settled in and smoked a bowl or two and then noticed a couple of texts on my phone.

""I'm drunk in Long Beach.""
""What are you doing?""

Uh..  Oh!  What AM I doing?  Nothing.  Not a goddamned thing.  But I'm not in Long Beach.  :(

I reply back ""Just got home.  Nothing special, what's up?""

""Can I come over?""

""Yes."" (I don't remember exactly what I said, but ""YES"" was the general idea.)

She said that she was getting a cab and would be there in 45 minutes or an hour.

Ok sweet

I realized that I should be in super-emergency-clean-the-apartment mode.

You've never seen someone clean their place as hard and fast as a dude with tail coming over unexpectedly.

I knew I had at least 45 minutes so I tidied up the living room, vacuumed, cleaned the bathroom, made my bed and threw all my dirty clothes and misc junk in a closet.

I looked around, pretty satisfied, then saw my cat's litter box.  I decided to change that too.  It wasn't really past due, but I wanted to toss the litter, wash out the pan and make the place as fresh as possible.

I take the litter and another bag of trash out and when I get back upstairs I realize that I'm completely out of new cat litter.  Balls.  I have T-20 minutes until FWB arrives and I still need to hop in the shower.  No time Toby, sorry bud.  I go to the kitchen and roll off about 12 feet of paper towels.  I tore them off into shorter strips and laid them in the bottom of his little cat igloo.

""Bro, use this tonight.  I'll figure it out in the morning.  Cool?  Cool.""
Situation solved, moving on.

I shower, get ready, greet her, drink gin, hottub, netflix, chill, sex stuff..  all that

We pass out around 3 or 4am.  And sleep hard.  Gin drunk and just got furcked hard.

Around 9am I wake up to take a piss, grab a bottle of water and smoke a cigarette on the balcony.  It's a cool foggy Saturday morning and I still don't have any plans.

When I got out of bed things were still pretty hazy.  Still drunk and can definitely tell that I'm going to be hungover as shit in a few hours.  But she's still there and I guess I'll probably finish this smoke and go back to bed.. take my shorts off and see if I can sneak one in the back door.  Why not?

I go back into my room, brush my teeth and slide under the sheets into bed behind her, pulling her hips close to mine.

I put my face up into the back of her head and take a breath.
Wow.  Her hair smells like shit.

It super smells like shit.

I took my face out of her hair and propped up on my elbow.  I looked around and smelled again.  Shitty.  Uhh, what in the fuck?

I pulled the sheets back and two perfect little turds flew out.  Like two huge tootsie rolls, flying out of an aggressively ripped open package, they shot up into the air, then landed back on the bed between us.

Which was when she woke up.

Have you guys ever see the Always Sunny episode ""Who Pooped the Bed?""
It was that.

After a lot of ""what in the fuck..  WHAT THE FUCK?"" from both of us, we calmed down and I figured out that my cat did NOT accept a few layers of paper towels in the shitter as an adequate replacement for litter.  And he decided to send me a message.  It was like the cat version of the Godfather.

The little bastard.
I still like him more tho.

TL;DR I didn't take my cat's shitbox seriously and he got revenge by crapping on a girl in my bed"
36ieoh,non_TBI,"My girlfriend and I had a row earlier this week because I declined to show her my browser history... not necessarily because I had anything to hide but rather I value some semblance of privacy.

In an attempt to be more open with her and make her feel better I conceded a few days later (yesterday) and let her look at my browser history. I forgot that the day prior I had been looking up ""How to tell if your girlfriend has had a sex change"" and ""traces of sex changes"". I will point out now that she does not look anything like a man and is in fact gorgeous, I found her drivers license which had ""Previous Type: M"" on there and that peaked my curiosity.

Anyway, she cried hysterically for around half an hour, became unresponsive, got in her car and left. I haven't been able to get through to her since.

TL;DR - My girlfriend thinks I think she used to be a man, so she took off"
3vl3h7,non_TBI,"This actually happened last night and I really don't want to go to work tonight because of it. But here it goes.

So I work at a local Mexican restaurant in town and just like any other Friday we were extremely busy. I had a tray of chips and salsa with me when I saw something fall out of a girls purse on my way to a table. I was in quite the hurry so I just picked it up without looking, placed it on the table, and said ""Excuse me, but this fell from your purse just now. Here you are!"" And I continued my original path.

Without taking 3 steps I hear what I assume to be the father of the family explode in rage. Before I could even turn around I hear behind me. ""Is this some kind of joke?!""

I turned and noticed the father looking at me to which I replayed,  ""Sir? What are you-"" And as I looked down on the table I realized my grave, grave mistake. It was a fucking condom.

Not only that, but I quickly scanned the table and noticed that the girl was with my one friend's younger brother! His brother is in 10th grade and I remember him telling me how proud he was of his little bro getting his first girl friend. And my god..The look on their faces told me everything I had to know. 

I couldn't rat them out! Especially to one of my best friend's little bro! If the dad knew the truth he would be dead!! Plus, I live in a small town so word gets around very quickly around here. So, I took the bullet. This is what happened.

Me - ""OH! OH MY GOD SIR I AM SO SORRY!"" *takes condom* ""I must of reached into the wrong pocket!..Ah! Here you go!"" *pulls out a $10 bill and places it on table* 

The look on the dads face was priceless. I tried not to laugh from the mixed looks of confusion/rage. But before he could get a word in I added. ""I'm so, so, SO sorry about that! I saw her drop this bill on my way out and I because my hands were full I must of reached into the wrong pocket! Oh man, my girlfriend is gonna kill me for this one! I'm really sorry about that, but you know how it is right?"" 

I laughed and ran in the opposite direction and never made eye contact with that table again. 

What sucks too is that was my only tip that night for I'm not a waiter so me getting tips is quite rare. Oh well, at least I got a text from my friend saying I saved his brothers ass. Apparently the father bought it! But from the remarks he said I don't think he's coming back here.

On the bright side! My boss thought it was hilarious and I didn't get fired! 

**EDIT 1**

AHHHH! My first gold! Holy shit thanks so much! :D


Also, it was **NOT** a used condom. It was still in the wrapper which is why I picked it up. I just assumed it was maybe some napkins or maybe makeup or something. Idk. I might be a bro, but there is no way in hell I would pick up a used condom and say it was mine. That's the kind of shit you get beat up for.  
**TL;DR**

Girl dropped a condom out of her purse at a family dinner with her BF. I gave it back, then made an excuse saying it was mine and I had it mixed with my $10 bill thus saving the day once again!"
2nufs6,non_TBI,"Tried to post a few weeks ago but didnt realize the weekend rule....I've been a lurker for a few months now and at the urging of my husband had to finally at least create a throwaway account today because I really fucked up. I’ve spent the last three days at a conference for high level professionals in my field. It’s a big deal to go to this conference and there’s a lot of pressure to look good in front of your colleagues and counterparts at similar firms as it’s a great place to network and find opportunities for advancement. 

My husband and I arrived a day early to check into a nearby B&B and spend some serious alone time away from the kids and multiple rounds of sex and experimenting were definitely on the agenda for the 24 hours prior to the conference. It was an opportunity to let loose and try out some new toys and things we’d heard about. In preparation for the trip, we packed lots of lube, straps for tying one another down, scarves to tie or blindfold one another and a sizeable vibrating, lifelike dildo. Needless to say, I had a ton of fun before the conference and blew off quite a bit of steam. At the beginning of the conference on Monday, my husband had to head back home and we agreed that I would keep the toy bag (a nondescript black duffle bag) in case I got lonely or stressed during my trip. Wanting to draw distinct lines between business and pleasure, I checked into the actual hotel where the conference was being held after my husband left and dragged in all of my luggage including my toy bag into the hotel with no incident until checkout this morning.

Overall, the week conference was great! I met great people, networked, found a ton of new contacts in my profession and even got upgraded to the top floor of the hotel into one of the nicer rooms for preferred guests by a pure stroke of luck. Fast forward to this morning at checkout and I packed all of my bags this morning and lugged everything back out to the elevator. There were a large group of people waiting for the elevator at the top floor all colleagues at the conference. When the elevator arrived, we all shuffled in, barely fitting and just as the doors closed, my toy bag dropped off my shoulder and to the floor. Some shifting must have happened inside because at that same moment, a loud, powerful buzz emanated from the bag. At first, I reached for my pocket thinking my phone was on vibrate but quickly realized in horror that my giant fake dick was on the highest vibrate setting and was buzzing inside the bad so loudly that everyone could hear it. The elevator was crowded enough I couldn’t bend down to reach the bag and even if I had been able to I don’t think it would have looked good grabbing a lifelike dildo from my bag in front of my new colleagues. Instead, I endured 6, painful floors of buzzing descent, crossing my fingers, and praying no one noticed or knew what was inside my bag. All hopes were dashed at the lobby as we exited the elevator and I got a number of knowing looks and even a wink from one gentleman. I rushed to the bathroom and in privacy, finally ripped out the batteries from the device, but at that point, the mortification and damage had already been done.

TL;DR Accidentally turned on my vibrator in a crowded elevator with new colleagues and everyone knew it.

2t8feh,non_TBI,"Long story short, it was removed because of the disclaimer /u/MyLifeSuxNow put in the posts today.

In the disclaimer, /u/MyLifeSuxNow said no one was allowed to to do anything with his story without his expressed permission, which is self-promotion and selling his ""story"". The mods confirmed this to me in a PM.

EDIT 1: Updating on request of a sub-reddit moderator. /u/MyLifeSuxNow has decided to permanently delete the posts himself, making them impossible to reinstate here. The mods had originally only deleted them but they could still be re-instated if /u/MyLifeSuxNow had deleted the disclaimer, which he has decided not to do.

EDIT 2: This update I'm making of my own accord because of the comments I'm seeing. To all the people putting down the mods for removing the updates, to shame. They were only adhering by the rules put in place here long before the updates began. /u/MyLifeSuxNow was pretty much trying to soliciting his story, which was already in the public domain to begin with. So why should an exception have been made just because this guy's submission got massive attention? 

If the mods gave him a break, the next person to come around and break a rule would call foul play and also expect a break. And let me reiterate, /u/MyLifeSuxNow could have removed the disclaimer and had his updates reinstated, but chose not to. The mods gave him a chance, and he chose not to take it. Not their fault.

30kk6h,non_TBI,"Reposting for the weekend. Retyped rather, I'm using a mobile device that brilliantly lacks copying and pasting.

Few things first. Had my four front upper teeth removed a little over a week ago. It was supposed to be just the two middle but my dentist figured what the hell. So I was forbidden solid foods for a week and it's still about a week until my stitches get removed.

Second, I have a very strong sex drive. More to the point, when I'm horny I also tend to be very forgetful.

So a couple of days before my surgery I'd put a box of cordial cherries in my fridge, from my freezer, to thaw out some. Forgot about them until a couple of days ago. I pull them out to sit and soften for awhile, thinking I could just suck on them later.

I frequent Yuriba MUSH and was enjoying some textual interaction that started to get hot and heavy. I get horny, masturbation follows. If anything trumps my hormones though, it's hunger. I wind up signing out to go put dinner in the oven.

I'm still horny though, so I start reading some erotica relevant to my interests. Without giving it much (i.e. 'any') thought I open the cordials and this is where I fucked up.

We all know about phantom limbs. I have phantom teeth.

Rather than drawing it back into my mouth to suck on, I did what I'd done to every cordial cherry I consumed prior to that moment. I bit down on it. With teeth I no longer had.

The chocolate crumbled, the cherry popped, and a stitch ripped.

I spent several hours in pain while sucking on a gauze pad for comfort and to stop the bleeding. Now the torn ends are bugging me and it's still a few days until removal.

TL;DR: I masturbated and, getting carried away, popped my cherry. Pain and bleeding ensued. Also, this is misleading despite being totally accurate."
41y265,non_TBI,"This fu happened less than an hour ago. 

 I recently (two days ago) got a tattoo on my right forearm in remembrance of a good friend who lost his battle with depression. This is not my first tattoo, and I'm not sure why I thought this would be a good idea. Anyway, I took the cellophane wrap off in the shower and noticed some hair growing back. Not a big deal I thought. The artist just missed some when shaving. Well, a few hours after my shower, the hair follicles started to swell. This hurt. A lot. So I figured if I shaved it down, it would potentially reverse the effect. So I jumped back in the shower and put shaving cream on my arm and grabbed my razor. Then the water was running off my hair and into my eyes. So I rubbed them with my hand (still covered in Gillette shaving cream); this was my first mistake. Well this burned like hell so I just kept my eyes closed. Then I aimed for my tattoo and tried shaving. The razor caught my healing skin and sliced its way through. Because it was so sharp, I had already peeled 4"" back off of my arm. 

So there I was screaming because of the shaving cream in my eyes and now my arm burns more than ever. Mind you my eyes are still closed. So I rinsed off my eyes and opened them to the second amount of most blood I've seen in my life. And I used to be a paramedic. So that's a lot of blood. Anyway, now I'm in the ER and they're talking about grafting skin off my thigh or ass to cover this up. Reddit, TIFU. 

TL:DR ; Shaved off a tattoo with a razor while blind.

Update: Typos, spelling, grammar, and pic.    http://i.imgur.com/qDHoxrS.jpg

Update 2: Yes, it was a straight razor. That's all I use.

 The artist told me to leave the wrap on for three days. "
2pha81,non_TBI,"This happened about 10 minutes ago.

I work in my own office in a building with about 10 other people on the same floor. It is not an office building set-up by any means (just so you don't picture this the wrong way). I hear a couple of my co-workers outside my office struggling with what sounds like a bunch of boxes falling over. I'm busy doing my thang, and they already have 2 people trying to do whatever they're trying to do, so I don't bother to go out and help.

Meanwhile, it becomes clear that they're trying to fit some boxes into a cabinet out there because for at least 5 minutes, there's just a barrage of comments not limited to the following:

""Don't do that. It doesn't fit.""
""Don't tell me what doesn't fit. I'll make it fit.""
""Help me squeeze it in.""
""That can't go there. It will rip if you push any harder.""
*clutter after loud struggle noises*
""This shouldn't be this hard.""
""Well we can't quit now. Keep trying.""
""This is dumb, I'm getting hot and sweaty over a bunch of boxes.""

After that last comment (and no, I don't know if that was the actual order those were all said in, but that was indeed all said and ended with that comment), I could no longer contain my inner 14-year-old. I raise my voice and say, ""Do you guys realize that your entire struggle has been one giant 'that's what she said'?""

All the noise stops, and then I hear footsteps slowly grow louder as they approach my office. I look over to see the executive director with a displeased expression on her face. She was not one of the original 2 dealing with the boxes. I don't know when she got in on the action, but I sure as hell had no idea.

Glaring at me and slightly out of breath, she says, ""Sure, just make your childish comments while we're clearly struggling out here. I'm glad we hired someone so mature."" And she walks away.

So naturally, I do the mature thing and type up a quick TIFU for Reddit. I think she's just butthurt because I beat her by less than 2 points last night to make it to the championship in our fantasy league.

tl;dr, Co-workers are struggling, I say that's what she said, executive director now thinks I'm an immature asshole. She's not necessarily wrong."
2ay8qt,non_TBI,"Long one, but good I promise.

This technically happened about a year ago now. 

So I'm a 21 year old male in Thailand with my girlfriend over the University break. I had been in the region for 3 weeks now (traveling over all Southeast Asia), and I was desperate to do the famed sex on the beach.

I am at Ko Samui, and its happy hour in the pool bar. I am pretty drunk at this point. Smashing cocktails for dirt cheap like only a college aged male could. Girlfriend gets to the pool to find me off my face floating about, it dawns on me as I look out at the beach in front of me. 

""We will kayak to that island"". Mind you, I am at this point completely blotto and this is typhoon season in Southeast Asia. 

Nonetheless, Thailand is not a country known for its safety legislation. I stumble out of the pool and towards the beach, hiring a kayak despite my obviously drunken state.

My drunken strength takes over and I power us over to this island (its only like a 15 minutes kayak away. However, the waves and surf are stronger than I had anticipated.

We eventually get to the nearby deserted island, and I take my girlfriend up a bit near the top of the beach where the sand meets the trees and leaves, to try and find a soft spot. My girlfriend is hesitant at first and I don't blame her after the stuff we had seen in this part of the world over the last 3 weeks I should be too. 

Finally, I can tick this off my bucket list... We are going at it in the sand for a good 2 minutes when suddenly I feel a sharp pain in my left hand. I look up. A scorpion scuttles away into the leaves where I had been bracing myself.Pain engulfs my hand and I immediately slide out and jump up off my girlfriend. 

Pulling my shorts up while running to the beach I yell to my girlfriend (who is still laying confused in the sand) ""IV BEEN STUNG WE NEED TO GET BACK"" ""SCORPIOS GOT ME""

We get in the kayak and are paddling back, however my girlfriend has little to no upper body strength. I look to the skies and in true Southeast Asian Wet season fashion, there's a massive storm incoming, and the rains are starting.

This is how I die... like most young Australians... killed by my own drunken stupidity in a lawless Asian country.

At this moment I somehow gain a second wind and use every ounce of strength to paddle us back (at this point my right hand has gone completely numb and swollen I am struggling hard against massive waves.)

We get to the beach, and the Thai guy at the resort we are staying at only asks ""was it a snake?"" to which I told him no, a scorpion. He seemed unconcerned and I went back to the hotel room to relax it in the bath. It came good within a week, but felt 75% better after 24 hrs. Didn't need any anti-venom



TLDR: Tried to have sex on the beach, got bitten by a scorpion and caught in a Thai tsunami


EDIT: WOOOOO Thank you for the gold and front page! Submitted this last night before bed, came to work to see this, this the greatest day of my life!

Yes I am from Sydney, Australia, we use mostly British english / sometimes American. 
Scorpion bite is harmless, there are only a few potential killers and they are not in Southeast Asia, checked this back in the hotel, didn't want to see a Thai hospital tbh. Also I was only stung on my right (dominant hand) not the left, sorry for typo."
3uhz1h,non_TBI,"So, this happened a year ago and it's still on my mind because of how embarrassing it was. 

My professor wears shorts all year round. I'm not sure why, but it has something to do with honoring an old friend that passed away. Our class was invited to a speaking series, which was off campus. We all had dress all business-like to go to the event. So, after the speakers were done, I walked out into the hall, which was crowded with students and other speakers and saw my professor standing there. He waved hello and I waved back and yelled ""Hey there! I didn't recognize you with pants on!"" The entire foyer of people stopped what they were doing and stared at me, then at him. Luckily, he's a smooth guy and played it cool but I panicked and ran out of the room. "
39tcby,non_TBI,"So GF and I were relaxing and watching a movie. She's really bad at finishing movies and I'm not a big fan of movies myself so we stop in the middle. We're lying on the bed checking phones and etc. at this point. (No she doesn't live at mine.)

I'm bored of using my phone at this point so I start cuddling and kissing GF. She's a VERY. I repeat. VERY. ticklish person. So I decide that I'd surprise her and in the middle of kissing her I'd start tickling her. You know, like those stupid stereotypical movie scenes where they both end up laughing and everything. Well, things don't happen like they do in the movies.

I start tickling her and she starts laughing like mad and trying to get me to stop. I tickle her on her stomach next and her leg jerks up and punted me square in the plums. I jump up and yelp in pain and smack my head onto her phone, causing me to fall back down onto the bed in pain, except I slightly miss the bed. I halfway land on the bed and am ejected back up into the air and into the dresser.

I end up clutching my bruised genitals in one hand and my bruised head in the other whilst my back hurts like hell. GF is laughing her ass off partly at the tickling and partly at me.



TL;DR Tickled GF, got nailed in the balls, ejected off the bed and smacked into a drawer. GF laughs at me too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDITS:

Oh yeah, she plays sports too. It was like taking a train to the testes.

I'd like to make the part about me not being a fan of movies clearer, I'm not that good at starting movies, but the movies themselves aren't that bad (depending on the movie).

I know I used the term ""Dropkick"" wrong, I just can't think of a better word to describe it with. (FIXED)

I'd like to point out that we didn't get distracted by the phones, we got distracted, never came back to the movie, and then went on our phones.

I keep seeing posts on how people that are ticklish aren't enjoying it. It wasn't to the degree of saying stop, she at least wasn't not enjoying it (if you'll excuse my shitty double negative)."
2fpbn4,non_TBI,"So first post ever, I thought i would share this with you guys, here it goes.

This didn't happen today but i figured that would be okay. I'm in a branch of military service and it had been some time since i'd been home and for those of you who don't know on government holidays most of us get the day off so we get an extended weekend. So I traveled all the way home and didn't arrive until around 5:00 AM so I immediately went to sleep. My girlfriend and I had planned out that she would come wake me early in the morning and well... as a 19 year old guy who hasn't gotten laid in a while was pretty horny. 

She texted me as soon as she left and it woke me up and i couldn't sleep anymore from the excitement. I wont go into too much detail because i'm not sure if i should or not but anyways she came straight into my room and we start going at for a while and things are going smooth and i'm doing all my favorite positions. I decide to be the big spoon and keep going, all of a sudden a hear a knock on the door and pull the blanket over us and i'm still inside.

From my grandmothers perspective it would have seemed like i just wasn't wearing a shirt (being fully naked) and my girlfriend was fully dressed (with her pants off). Anyways my grandmother walks in and doesn't expect a thing we just both smile and say hi innocently like we weren't in the middle of having sex. My grandmother pulls out her new camera and snaps a picture of us laying in bed... I was absolutely mortified. I can imagine looking in photo albums years from now and seeing our shame and sweat...

And that's that. Now it seems pretty funny my girlfriend is still super embarrassed.   

TL;DR Went home to visit girlfriend, grandma unknowingly took picture of me and my girl friend having sex

Edit: So for everyone asking did i finish? Of course I did. Also a big thank you i'm glad a lot of you liked my story and I really appreciate the advice i'll try to incorporate all of your tips into any, if at all, future stories.
Oh, also its not like my grandmother let us do what ever we wanted, we've just been together for 3 years now and me being gone so frequently doesn't permit us to be together much, so my grandmother doesn't mind when we lay down together. 

p.s. I'll think about rewording the title next time... gross but hilarious you dyslexic folk."
2wqx5h,non_TBI,"So last night I went to city with my girlfriend and a couple of mates to see the White night festival. For those who think this was held by the KKK don't fret, it's just an art expo that is held at Melbourne CBD in Australia.  

The night was great, lots of cool artwork and buskers to entertain even the most melancholy heart. When we finished up we ended up splitting ways, most caught the train home but the missus and I crashed at a friend's place for the night.  We were under strict orders not to sleep together since we all were sharing a room and my friend wasn't too keen on any funny business from us. So my girlfriend was delegated the couch and I was given a mattress on the floor.

I was expecting my girlfriend to sneak into my sheets during the night but sadly that didn't happen. So in the morning I decided to coax her over and after a painful amount of time, I convinced her to join me on the mattress. Here is where it goes down hill. While she was sleeping, I decided to be a bit cheeky and try to give her a ""happy dream"". So I touched her in all the ways she likes, such as running my finger across her torso, rubbing my hand up and down her inner thighs, grabbing her ass, and playing with her clit etc. This usually gets her in the mood pretty quick and she was responding just how I expected, making cute little moaning sounds and breathing quite heavily. This went on for about 15 minutes, when suddenly she woke up startled. With both hands and a fair amount of force she pushed me back, then sighed 'thank god'.

Turns out she wasn't having a naughty dream. She was dreaming that she was being publicly molested by a creepy man that was touching her and feeling up her dress and wouldn't leave her alone. When she woke up, she realised it was just me and was filled with relief. Apparently the dream felt pretty real.

tl;dr I tried to give my girlfriend a ""happy dream"" by touching her in her sleep, and she ended up dreaming she was being felt up by a creepy man.

**EDIT:** Wow we didn't expect this to get so much attention, thanks for the upvotes. As girlfriend and I were reading through the comments we've realised there are quite a few controversies here, so we're going to try and clarify a few things. Firstly, yeah I copped shit from my mate for going against his request, but he's cool with it now and we all had a good laugh about the whole situation. Secondly, I realised after I did it that this could be considered kinda rapey. However, girlfriend was completely fine with it, and even mentioned afterwards that she'd like to try it again, despite the fact that it didn't work out this time. Thirdly, she feels better knowing this has happened to other women too, she thought she was weird."
30ynqy,non_TBI,"Ok so this actually happened today.
So, I was at the dentists today for my dental check up. I was waiting for like 30 mins, really bored, when suddenly this absolutely HOT dentist calls my name for the check up. Immediately I started imagining all sorts of fantasies with her, coz well, she was hot AF. Anyway I go into the room and I'm told to lie down on the chair (which reclines). The hot dentist then comes over to me and does the usual check ups, and damn the close up I got of her was AMAZING. Anyway, halfway through the check up, my fantasies were still going strong and well...I ended up getting an erection. Worst thing was, she saw it as well. She actually stopped for a minute and waited for my erection to go. To rub the salt in she asked if I was 'done dreaming'. The rest of the check up was really awkward after. That was my FU today lol.

TL;DR - Got erection because of hot dentist. She saw it. Awkwardness.

EDIT: Ok so a lot of people think that I made this up as I quoted her saying ""done dreaming"". She actually did say that and she was pretty uncomfortable with the whole thing. Sorry if there was any confusion or anything. "
2w5any,non_TBI,"I had one installed for a surprise for Valentines Day in my bedroom.
Had fun and enjoyed the novelty of it that night with the girl I'm dating after a couple bottles of wine.
I didn't have to work in the morning but she did so she left late that night.
As I awoke the next morning, a bit hungover, with the sun beaming through the window and almost had a heart attack when I opened my eyes cause I thought a naked guy was falling on me."

3fjjsn,non_TBI,"I'm a firefighter. I was on duty last night, and we got a call around 3:30AM for an old guy who got drunk and fell down. The FU has to do with my firehouse pajamas. Since we have to go from asleep to responding in a minute or two, whenever I sleep at the firehouse, I wear boxers and a uniform shirt. If we get a call, I pull on my bunker pants and boots. Well last night when we get the call, I was super disoriented as we were running to the truck. When I finally got bunkers on and got in the truck, the guy riding next to me tapped me on my shoulder and pointed to my crotch. Somehow in the confusion, my dick had poked out of my boxers and was flopped across my lap.

TL;DR: Fireman laid some hose."
1mz0af,non_TBI,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I thought you guys might find more humor in what happened to me than I do.



Today I've been feeling particularly horny. I think it's a combination of PMS (which makes me want to have a dick inside me in the worst way), and just thinking about the incredible sex I had this past weekend. 



Well, my boss was in a meeting all day today so I let the horny-ness get the best of me. I pulled up pictures of my boyfriend's dong and I knew I just had to slip my pants down to mid-thigh level and get to it.



I was really close to coming when I heard someone start walking up the stairs but I figured, fuck it, it *can't* be my boss..he's down in the meeting room all day! It has to be someone else going to their office. At that moment, I heard the door to my office open. Fuuuuuck.



I quickly pulled my pants up, but he walked around the corner in time to see me doing some buttoning up. Having been so close to orgasm, just the seam of the pants touching there made me come. As he's trying to talk to me acting like he didn't know what I had been doing.



As I tried my darndest to *not* show any signs of orgasm-occurence, I couldn't help my voice trembling. I could feel the flush color of my cheeks as well. But worst of all, I could see my boss getting a boner. My 68-year old boss turned on by my masturbation/orgasm. He then went into the bathroom for a few minutes, and we haven't exchanged words since the incident.



Hello Monday. This will be an awesomely awkward week at work.



tl;dr: Boss walked in, I orgasmed, he got hard. Pretty sure he fapped too."
2nbfo8,non_TBI,"My girlfriend had been setting my desktop pictures to poop and dildos recently. She was watching YouTube on her phone when I reminded her

“Dildos?”

She took a good few seconds to register what I’d said and responded with a

“Huh?”

It took her long enough to respond that I gave up on the conversation and responded with

“Nothing.”

“Did you just say dildos?!”

“No why would I say that?”

“Oh, okay.”

A few minutes later, once she had returned to YouTube, I had decided on a dastardly plan.

“Dildo.”

“Did you just say dildo?”

 “No, why the fuck would I say dildo?”

“I swear you just said dildo.”

""Seriously, why would I say dildo?”

She once again returned to YouTube, at this point beginning to question her sanity.

“Dildo.”

“Stop saying dildo!”

“Seriously, I'm not saying anything.”

“But I could have sworn you did!”

“Just chill out!”

This time she started recording on her phone, so I went silent for quite a while. She gives up and starts her YouTube video again.

I present her a picture of an armadillo and tell her I'm thinking of getting a tattoo of one. She looks unsure. I tell her

“Armadildos look cool though!”

""Seriously if you say dildo one more time I'm breaking up with you.""

“I didn't say dildo!”

Once again YouTube comes back on.

I do a quick search for words rhyming with dildo, which doesn't look too suspicious as she knows I tend to scan Reddit for trivia.

“You're into the Olympics right? Did you know about the skier Lindsey Vonn?”

“No.”

She was very on edge.

“Did you know she used to be called Lindsey Kildow?”

Right that’s it we're over.

A 40 minute argument ensues, including a storm off and locked bathroom door.

TL;DR: Sleeping on the couch because I tormented my girlfriend with subliminal dildos."
3e5iip,non_TBI,"So i workout at my uni gym. i had a midterm yesterday early in the morning and so for the first time i decided to take a shower at the uni gym after my test and workout. I decided to bring my swimming trunks with me because i am not comfortable going naked in the showers.
So my test goes good. Have a good workout. Head back to my lockers and for the showers as i fucking stink at this point and I realize i forgot my swimming trunks. Fuckk. Decided to go naked in the showers like all the old dudes as i have have no other choice. Though i will just have a quickie. My gym also has a swimming pool and only way to that is through the showers.
Here is where the most embarrassing moment of my life occurs. Its summer and my uni conducts summer camps. I was 5 mins into my shower feeling more comfortable being naked in the showers and i hear fucking kids coming towards the shower. I fucking panicked and froze. And the next thing you know i am butt naked in front of a dozen 10 year old kids. FUCK ME. Their camp councillor is giving me a bad eye. one of the kids asks his councillor "" Will we be taking a full shower too?"". The kids go in the pool and i fucking leave the shower knowing more 10 year old kids have seen me naked ,than girls at this point in my life. Fucking sucks man.

2bv34l,non_TBI,"So last night me and my girlfriend went to a pre-wedding party. After the nights festivities we travelled home, when everyone else went to the bar. My girlfriend and I began to mess around with me eating her out and playing with her butt. At some point she stopped me and said let's use the butt plug (something that she had me buy over a year ago, but never used). So you could imagine my excitement when she said ""bust out the plug."" I get it out with the lube and must've dumped the whole bottle on it because what happened next honestly makes me scared to ever use that thing again. I put it in her butt too fast or too hard cuz next thing I know her ass swallowed the whole thing. Naturally I panic and try to go in after it. She's like wtf are you doing? I said don't freak out, but I lost the plug in your ass.  She's like  no way, and began to look around the bed for it (idk how she couldn't feel it  but we were pretty drunk). When she realized that it really was up her ass she waddled to the bathroom close to tears. I'm super upset thinking I just broke my girlfriend.  I felt relieved when I heard the water running and just praying we weren't going to be one of those couples at the ER for sex toy extraction. She walks out and throws the butt plug on the ground. Needless to say she went straight to bed and I'm no longer allowed near her butthole.

3l0xes,non_TBI,"So this happened yesterday rather than today.

I got home from work yesterday and my dog was super energetic so I decided it would be a good idea to go to a field local to me and throw frisbee and let him run around a bit.

The field near my house is fairly open and large but its surrounded by trees with a few paths that sometimes people go for walks on. After a few throws, my dogs energy levels just aren't going down so I figure i'm just gonna belt this frisbee as far as I can.

Here's the fuck-up: As soon as I cocked back my arm and threw the frisbee with the power of Zeus himself, I noticed a family coming out of the trees. Now my dog is bolting across the field faster than i've ever seen him run, and I mean he is gunning it to the point where he's actually creating a dust trail behind him. This family are now further into the field. I see my dog looking back to where the frisbee is coming down. I spot the child. I can see what's going to happen. My dog lunges himself off the ground towards the frisbee and as he's coming down he literally decimates this small child with his body and goes tumbling.

All I hear is an angry father yelling ""HEY FUCKWIT"" so in panic I turn and start sprinting away quickly followed by my dog who has no idea what he's just done and thinks we're going for a run.

TL;DR - my dog jumped off the top ropes and KO'd a small child.

Edit: I have a Pitbull-Boxer mix that weighs 68 pounds"
3zdtyn,non_TBI,"I want to preface this by saying it's been over a year since I've had sexy time. This happened about 3 hours ago. So, I'm at home after work and get a message from a stranger, it's a half-naked lady. The flash from her camera is hiding her face but she has a tattoo that looks similar to one my ex has, and it's a local number. I shall break down the conversation, please note my smooth opener. M=me H=her

M: ""Hi"" (keep it in your pants, ladies)

H: Another pic, ""How are you?""

M: ""Starting to feel pretty great, you?"" (Ladies stay calm, I know I'm super smooth.)

H: Another pic, ""Horny."" 

She is getting progressively more naked but it's obvious she's using the flash to hide her face. At this point I'm near positive this isn't my ex, but I need to figure out if it is. I keep playing along...

I go in for the kill...

M: ""Nice.""

H: Another pic. ""lol, you gonna do something about it?"" Here's my opening to figure it out.

M: ""Maybe, you still live on xyz street?""

H: Another pic. Hey, she shaves, definitely not my ex... ""Do you even know who this is?""

M: ""I thought I did, but I guess not.""

H: ""Is this Mark?""

I say nope and apologize. She actually apologizes too. 

M: ""Hell no, dont apologize you made my night, I'll delete the pictures tho.""

H: Another pic. ""You don't have to. You owe me a couple tho"" 

Game fucking on boys, she fell for the ole' charm!

M: ""Come and get it.""

H: ""No, you.""

M: ""Ok.""

Turns out she lives all of 15 minutes away.

And this is where the fuck up happens. 

I find her apartment, excited as hell to end the drought. She opens the door, naked, looks me up and down, smirks and closes the door. I get a text.

H: ""No, go away."" I begin to contemplate manslaughter. But just make a stop at the gas station and get a 6 pack.

So yea I'm pretty crushed. I tried to add some humor hoping you guys might smile.

"
3judbx,non_TBI,"I had to do an airport pickup run about a week ago.  The airport is pretty far from me, so I took the toll road which cuts my trip down to an hour.   About halfway through, I start to get that feeling down below that every guy recognizes instantly.  Girls don't really understand it the same as we do.  So I looked for a good spot and pulled off to the side of the road.


I hopped out of the car, and sure enough what I felt was correct - I had a flat tire.   Not just from rarely working out, one on my car as well.  This being a toll road, they have little helpy-helpers driving up and down who would eventually stop and help out, but I was on an airport run and didn't want to risk waiting and be late, so my FU begins by changing my own tire.   

I have changed tires before.  I wasn't on a slope.  The jack was in the right place.  I have no idea what happened.  I starting jacking up the car, and somehow I jacked off the car.  One moment I saw the weight coming off the tire, and the next moment the car was slammed back onto the ground and the jack was on its side.  I have no clue how it happened, but part of the jack slammed my hand pretty hard which hurt like hell.  So I carefully brushed the ground clean, I thought maybe it was on a rock or pebble which it rolled on.


Second try, I changed the tire with no problems. Made it to the airport in time for my pickup.  Yay.  


Well, my finger kept hurting.  Hurt the next day.  Started to get swollen.  I went to the doctor, and now I'm on antibiotics and have some cream to put on it.  Awesome.  


**TL;DR** Jacked off my car, got a Sedan-Transmitted-Disease 



EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the love reddit!  Parking brake was for sure set, checked it immediately after.  It seems /u/namegoeswhere nailed it though, he called out the exact car and jack it was.  Maybe I'm not a total fuckup.
"
3vkg09,non_TBI,"Obligatory: This was a few years ago, happened somewhere between 8th and 9th grade. Can't remember the exact date

It all started when I learned how to torrent. I had a semidecent laptop that could run plenty of stuff semidecently. It had a webcam, mic, nice keyboard, big screen, etc. I had it set up in the den on top of a portable TV table, and I sat in a huge comfy chair. 

Anyway, one day I ventured to the wonderful site that is thepiratebay. I saw all the awesome stuff I can download for free, and after a while I got pretty good at it. Download, mount, cut off WiFi, install, play. All kinds of free games, what could go wrong?

Fucking viruses. Viruses can go wrong.

One day my computer starts acting all weird. It starts playing short clips from random songs, some I had never heard of before. They became incredibly annoying, especially when I had a date over and suddenly my computer started playing ""YOU AND ME BABY AINT NOTHIN BUT MAMMALS SO LETS DO IT LIKE THEY DO ON THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL"". Didnt have a follow up date, strangely.

Anyway, these occurances became more and more common. Somehow Malwarebytes didn't pick up on it, and it was rather annoying.

So here's the huge fuck up.

I get home from school one day. It was one of those great days where some super hot girl bends over to grab something out of her bag and you get a great 20 second long stare at her boobs dangling from her chest. One of those days where you get home and you have only one thing in mind: Fap. I plop down in my big chair, start up my singing PC, and venture to the good ol pornhub. Off go the shorts, and I start strokin the salami. All was well... Until all the fucking planets align and shine down right on me jerking it in front of my pc. The screen turns pure white and all sound stops, then shortly after my webcam light comes on. I'm just sitting there, staring at it like a deer in headlights... legs spread with my dick in my hand.

Then it comes up with a page saying the FBI (assuming federal bullshit institute for this) locked down my PC for torrenting, and actually showed pictures of the various torrented iso files I had. Then, I the top right corner, is that fucking picture. Me sitting there, staring blindly while I hold a hard dick in my hand. The page tells me I must pay $500 to get my computer back.

Now of course I'm not gonna shell out $500 to a bunch of assholes who may or may not stop the ransomware, so I decide to try to fix it myself. After hours of trying with no luck, I brought it to Best Buy. And everyone there got to see that fucking picture. 

Even best buy couldn't fix it, so then I had to bring it to my dad (my parents are separated, I lived at my moms. Dad is a tech god.) 

My dad nearly died laughing at my expense before he popped into command prompt and fixed it almost instantly. 

Easily one of the most embarrassing things to ever happen to me

Tl;Dr: fapped to porn, virus took my pic and plastered it on a ransomware screen. Took it to Best buy with no luck, then my dad. Everyone saw me staring at a screen with my wang rock solid, I my hand.

3c4963,non_TBI,"In my office there is a floor that is not used very often, and an empty conference room that is used still less. 

A few months ago on a lunch break I stood on the desk in there and lifted the ceiling tile. It's one of those drop ceiling things. I put a chair on the desk and then I saw I could climb into the ceiling. 

So once or twice a week for the past few months I have climbed into that part of the ceiling to masturbate. 

I made it more comfortable by lining the beam with towels, and putting a cushion I could lay my head on, and I put pornographic materials up there. 

I figured it was very harmless, out of sight. Plus it was just fun to masturbate up inside a ceiling. Very arousing. Also psychologically it felt like in a small way I was sticking it to the company I worked for.

It was working fine for months, no issues. Then the other day I was masturbating in the ceiling I heard the door open below. I froze. I heard voices. 

People were actually using this room for a meeting.

I was horrified. I was in the ceiling. My pants and boxers were on the floor down below, under the desk. And the ceiling panel I used was still ajar. 

In my baffled state of fear I knocked over the vodka bottle I kept up there with me. (I did one shot pre-masturbate and one shot post-masturbate. Never more than 2 so not like I got wasted at work...)

The vodka fell out of the ceiling. I heard startled reactions below and calls for people asking who was up there. 

I have never known such panic in my life. All I knew was that I could not go down there. I couldn't. But I knew it was a matter of time before one of them poked their head up here.

I decided my best bet was to scramble along the beams through the ceiling and hop down in another part of the office and just hide. 

I tried to do it, but I fell almost at once. I tumbled through the ceiling and landed on the floor in the office. My cushion and towels and pornographic materials fell with me. 

I lay there on the floor for a few seconds, naked from the waist down. Everyone was looking at me in absolute revulsion and incomprehension. 

I scrambled to my pants by the desk, put them on, and literally ran out of the office. 

I have not checked my phone or emails since. I do not know how I can face anyone at work ever again. 


TL;DR - Automoderator forces this? Well, I masturbated in the ceiling at work and got caught. I am ashamed.

334yqr,non_TBI,"Two weeks ago my grandma passed away at 94. I wasn't that close to her, as she lived across the country and I rarely saw her. The funeral was scheduled for a week later (last week), and I accepted to be one of the coffin bearers (not sure what you call those in english). After the church ceremony, we drove 10 minute to the cemetery, where she would be buried. The hearse drove her all the way to her graveside. We waited a while for everyone to gather, there was a ton of people, most I had never seen before. It was also the first funeral I had been to, and being there with all these people I didn't know made me very uncomfortable. The shit weather didn't make it any better, it had been raining for three days, and it was also raining this day. We carried her from the coffin wagon to her grave, where we would lower her down. It was kindda awkward getting into position and connecting the ropes to the handles. On both sides of the grave two planks were placed on the ground, so we could stand on them as it was so pretty muddy. When I stood up on it, I instantly felt how ""wonky"" it was. Everything went fine, we lowered the coffin slowly, and we let go of the ropes when we felt it hit the bottom of the grave. Then it all went wrong. We were three people on the plank, my brother, uncle, and me, with my uncle being in the middle. My brother stood off the plank, and my uncle still had one foot on it, when I felt the plank slide under me. I thought I was going to fall into the the grave, and everything went into slow-motion mode. Without thinking I grabbed onto my uncles arm. While I found my balance, he slipped and lost his. The next thing that happened was something so terrible, I will never forget it in my life. He fell straight into my grandma's grave, and landed on her coffin (which thankfully didn't break, it was terrible enough as it was). I remember the gasp from the crowd, and my mother's face in disbelief. The rest of the day was too painful to think of.

TL;DR: I lost balance after lowering my grandma's coffin, grabbed onto my uncle's arm and accidentally pulled him in."

Fast forward to this morning at 6 AM and it sounds like someone is rhythmically hammering on the ceiling. I can't fathom what the hell that noise is. Maybe construction?

Then, I remember the package. Turns out Jump Sport is a company that sells exercise trampolines. I guess I don't need an alarm clock anymore.

2qxw8b,non_TBI,"So I'm home for the holidays in the Chicago land area. There hasn't been any snow or any precipitation and mostly has been in the 40's the past week, except for last night and today where it has dropped to about 10 degrees F. Typically at night, my parents are in bed by 9 pm and I stay up to about 1 am. During this time I spend my time downstairs watching TV or playing games, but the closest bathroom is up a flight of stairs and I really had to go. Instead I open up the basement door, which leads directly outside (we live on a hill so the basement is outside in the back of the house), and do my business there. Normally I take a few steps out and pee into the bushes but it was extremely cold so standing at the edge of the door, I just did my business right there on the concrete walkway to the back door.

Flash forward to this morning, I wake up to hear screaming. My dad is out running errands, and it sounded like my mother. I run around the house in a frantic until I look out the kitchen window lying on her side surrounded by a pile of boxes. I quickly threw my shoes on and headed that way. Turns out she was taking down the outdoor lights before the snow came and putting them into storage in our basement. She's hurt bad and says she slipped on some ice. I look down and see a unique patch of ice about 8 inches wide and 3 feet long that has a yellow tint and white bubbly foam. Oh my god, my piss from last night had frozen over and caused her to slip on fall on her hip (that she had replaced last year). 

That was about 3 hours ago, I got her upstairs to the bath for a while, she had some left over pain meds from her hip replacement, and is currently laying in bed. I threw salt on the ice and removed it before she went back for further inspection. 

TL;DR Peed outside the house last night, froze in the subzero temperature, mom slipped on that pee this morning. I'm a terrible child"

3pwyjo,non_TBI,"First of all I would like to thank everyone for their comments, advice, the gold, homophobic creepy pm's, and requests for dick pics. I'm truly flattered. 

I apologize for not being active in the first post. As you could probably conclude I was at work, and by the time I got home the post had 1,500 comments. 

**So...the update.**

Like many of you suggested I came to the conclusion that the best way to get out of this was to have my boyfriend come up to my work. I didn't take it as far as boning him on Vee's desk like some of you suggested, but chose to just politely introduce him to the office. I know...disappointing, though I did show him the comments on the thread and he was down for it. Luckily cooler heads prevailed or I would be writing a new TIFU. 

It took some convincing, but his adorable charm won them over the same way it won me over years ago.  There was a lot of apologizing on both fronts. I talked to Vee and apologized for sending wrong signals.. blah blah blah, and she apologized for putting me in that situation blah blah blah....We agreed to forget it. All the ladies said they were sorry and everything is hunky-fucking-dory now. All in all I rate the experience a 2/10 and would not recommend.

2hw7h2,non_TBI,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, 
--------------------------------------------------

At the company I work, there is a woman, we'll call her Sara, Sara has been in a monogamous lesbian relationship for many years with her partner, they moved here about a year ago and are currently planning thier wedding.

I am already married, for 10+ years, 3 beautiful children, the house, the car, the whole 9 yards.

Sara and I have taken to eating lunch together, sometimes going out to local resturants, sometimes not, but either way, we've become very friendly, and have on occassion, had a few adult beverages with our meals.

over the course of one of these lunches, she revealed to me that she had never been with a man before, and gets very turned one while servicing her partner while she's wearing a toy.  At this point, the small brain kicks in and I make the half joking offer of being her first, she blushes and that is the end of it right? 

a week later, she asked me if I was serious, now let me state here that I do love my wife, and my family, but after 3 kids, sex is kind of an after thought, and when your 40, you figure you'd be done jerking off right? NOPE! I tell her yes, I would be honored.

This sets off the chain of events that leads us to her house for ""lunch"" a week later, and truthfully, she's not bad, she didn't mind the taste and she swallowed because in her words ""If I'm going to do this, I'm doing it right""

After this, nothing, amazingly it looked like it would really be a one time thing, however the flirting, the texting, naughty emails started happening, and there was this air of lust that would come over us when we were together, and we started to ""Play"" every week, at her place, anything she wanted to try, I was game for, she enjoyed anal having done it with her partner, she enjoyed my beard between her legs, she said it enhancend things for her in a way should wouldn't have expected. 

after a few months of this, she says to me that she's on birth control, and she wants to feel cum inside her, and like a fool, I ablige her, continually

2 weeks ago she texts me saying ""Look, I'm pregnant, I'm an adult and I'll take care of this""

just wow, I mean, I know it's my fault too, but she's not just gay, but gay all the way (on the ouside) and she's got really bad morning sickness too, not just a little, but in the hospital with dehydration, sickness, and all the while, she's not telling her partner whats wrong, and I can't comfort her in anyway because no one knows she's knocked up but her and I.

Gah fuck me... I'm doomed and it's all my fault! 

*edit* - yes, I knew it was wrong, and I didn't care, I take full responsiblity for my actions, I'm still in shock about it.

I already know I'm scum, but thanks for making sure I know

and I'm sorry, but yes she is/was/ a lesbian, she was also very attractive, and I admit my mistakes, not sure if I'll tell my wife, as many have pointed out, she'll find out eventually

No, I've never cheated before, we've been married 13 years so far, it never even became an issue before this.

She was on birth control for period issues, apparently she changed BC due to issues with one and that's when it happened.

Not sure what her plans are, we haven't really talked since the I'm an adult comment, but I know her partner is very much anti men.

And yes, for those of you calling me out on it, It's true, I wish it was bullshit, but it's not, and I'm not sure what to do right now, I'm waiting to hear from her about what she wants to do, I mean, I'll obviously push for Abortion and am willing to cover 50% of the cost.

And finally, I do love my wife, very much, we've been together almost 20 years, married for 13, our kids are 12, 8 and 5.  This was not about love, this was about sex, purely, We have been seeing a marraige counselor for over 2 years about our sexual dysfunction, I'm overtly sexual, she could live without it, it's been a bone of contention for years, and I was weak, I admit that.

Edit 2: TIL: Marriage is super serious to a lot of people on Reddit.

Edit 3: When she told me, I offered to pay 100% of the abortion, she replied that she carries part of the mistake and wouldn't let me do that, So I said at least let me pay half, which is where the I'd pay for half came from. 

*UPDATE**

Upon arriving to work this morning, I noticed that ""Sara"" was not in, seeing as though we do not work in the same department, I didn't snoop around too much.  At about 10 am, I recieved a text message from her, she's at the airport currently waiting to board a flight back to Florida, Sorry to dissapoint, but she did not tell her partner, she instead had decided to go visit family for a week and while in FL, get an abortion.

Work was informed that there was a family emergency and she needed to take time off to travel and it was granted.  We've both decided that this is the end of our relationship.  She has again refused my offer to pay even for part of the procedure, and will not be telling her partner what happened.

I've decided not to tell my wife either, feel free to continue the hate, I know I fucked up here, I was ready to deal with the consequences, now the consequence is my own guilt.  Will I tell my wife what happened? I don't know, maybe someday but no time soon.  I have no desire to be a cheater, I accept that I betrayed her, and I will work to make good on the promise I made 13 years ago.

for those of you who had supportive comments, I say thank you, 
for those of you who had negative comments, I say thank you as well, 
for those of you who thought this was a lie, or otherwise trolling for Karma or otherwise, sorry guys, it's all true unfortunatly.

As for my spelling, and people saying I sound like I'm 14, That's fine, I can't spell, usually autocorrect works in my favor, however Private Browsing on firefox and the autocorrect doesn't seem to work, and I can't be assed to figure it out.

As for the people asking what I do, the answer to that is pure irony.
I work in IT, at a biomedical company, that specialises in in vitro fertilization, no joke.
**** UPDATE again*****

It's done, Sara has returned, her partner none the wiser, my wife none the wiser, we are both accepting of our mistake and while it would not be prudent for me to speak for her, I know it's not a mistakes I will make again.

"
3jqx39,non_TBI,"So, like a lot of these, this took place some time ago (a few years when I was 17). It was the day that my 18 year old sister, lets call her Emily because...well... thats her real name, was moving away to college. I somehow managed to convince my best friend, we'll call him Klark because he hates when people spell his name with a K, to make the drive with us and help my family move all of Emily's shit into her dorm. Btw, this was a southeast school and it was mid August, so temps around 100 and plenty of humidity. It takes us a few hours of hard work to get everything moved in, and then we helped her roommate move her stuff in too, adding another hour and a half of work. Finally we finish, and everyone is drenched in sweat and absolutely exhausted. Cue my fuck up. 

Before moving, Emily had been unsure of how to sneak a few handles of vodka in with her stuff so that my very strict parents would not notice. I had the smartass idea of replacing half the water bottles in an 18 pack with vodka. Boom, easy solution. We would put that pack of bottles out of the way in her dorm room and leave another out for people helping with the move to drink. Somehow, my mom had managed to pull out the vodka loaded pack from underneath Emily's bed. I'm not sure where Emily was at this point, but she wasn't in the room. It was my parents, younger sister (15yo), Klark, Emily's roommate and 12yo sister, and the roommate's parents. 

All I could do was watch as my mom started handing out random 'water' bottles to everyone in the room. She had effectively started a high stakes game of vodka-roulette with a 12 year old involved. First she handed one to my father and little sister. Keep in mind everyone is thirsty AF so people are taking massive chugs of these bottles. No reaction from their faces--phew, water. Next up, roommate and her parents. MASSIVE chugs...no reaction--phew, water. Next, 12yo roommate's sister....I could hardly watch. She took a sip big enough to fuck up a 12yo (so a medium one)... no reaction--phew water. Last up, Klarksicle. He took about a third of the bottle in one huge swig and then made a face that looked like a mix of being hit by a train and moose-kicked in the balls. After gagging and drinking it discretely, he stormed out, not a happy camper, but an intoxicated one. 

He still gives me shit for this all the time, but I figure it could have been a 12 year old girl, which would have made for an awkward first time meeting that family. Plus I still think it's one of the funniest situations I've encountered. Win-win. 

TL;DR: Almost indirectly introduced a 12 yo girl to alcohol, aristocrat vodka style. "
2uehfh,non_TBI,"Was at my girlfriends house laying down on the couch under some blankets watching a movie. My gf is really horny and she starts messing around under the covers, we know that her dad was upstairs (so we were trying to be as incognito as possible. So we start doing the deed and i try my best to keep it low profile, but after a few minutes my super slick skillz seem to fade and get caught up in the moment. Wellllll, her dad starts walking down the stairs and i notice him when he gets halfway down with just a blanket around his waist (theres a jacuzzi in the backyard). He stops. I stop. We look at each other in the eyes. Im thinking to myself ""this is the way i die huh?"" he asks us ""what are you guys doing?"" I reply ""she was trying to fight me and so i was fighting back"" (this was the most rational thing i could think up in those few short moments) He looks at us with a puzzled look in his eye comes down the stairs and asks me to get up. 
*Fast Fwd 2 hrs later as i sit and type this up*
I have a black eye and im never allowed to see his daughter again.

*EDIT 1*:(Additional information between ""Get up"" and ""fast fwd"")- ""Get up"". I get up, shorts around my ankles and dick poking through my boxer hole. He drops the one thing shielding us from his penis and runs at me and swings at me. His fist makes the lovely awesome connection with my eye and i saw stars (not the good kind). GF is screaming and crying. I pick up my shorts and make a move for the door. He chases my ass to my car and says ""if i ever see your ass near my daughter again i will seriously hurt you""  
I have learned my lesson. Do not date an ex cons daughter. If you do, dont have sex w/ her while hes home.

*EDIT 2*: Im not pressing charges because I know I was in the wrong. This event is a golden memory and I feel no anger towards the dad. GF and i talked about it and we're going to see if he cools off... in a month or two, then going to apologize... on the phone. Not going to risk letting him land another. 

 *EDIT 2a*: For those of you saying im a pussy for not pressing charges: Im not pressing charges because im not the type of person that flips out and has the police on the scene for any little thing that doesnt go my way. I wasnt raised to sue people for trivial shit. If he had a weapon and hit me with it that wouldve been a different story. He came at me as a man, (no pun intended) mano a mano.


*EDIT 3*: Warning- Punctuation is not my forte

*EDIT 4*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdUGKsclv-s  NARRATED BY CYAE1. Thanks man this is epic

*UPDATE* : Heading over to GF's house tomorrow to speak with her pops. (GF said her parents spoke about it and her mom managed to call him down) Wish me luck.

*LAST UPDATE* : Hey guys , so i went over to my GF's house to speak with her dad and i basically apologized about being careless and messing around with his daughter while he was home. Which led to me also saying that im not apologizing on us having sex, and told him how much i care about his daughter and all the other typical things you hear in the movies. He apologized for reacting the way he did and that he appreciates that i came to him as a man. I think we're good now. Thanks Redditors for all the advice you have provided. -randy"
3xjbep,non_TBI,"This happened just this morning. I turned 18 a few weeks ago, and my mom insisted that I go for my first ever gyno check up. I'm still a virgin, and nothing has ever really been wrong with me, so I'd never gone until today. A few of my friends have gone and they all tell me that the instruments are really cold, you have to get completely naked, and overall it's just really weird. I'm a pretty private person, and only one guy has seen me partially naked before, so I was scared.  

That day my mom was really busy with work, so she couldn't take me. I just needed a parent to come to fill out the paperwork, insurance, etc. and unfortunately that left only my dad to take me. We got to the doctor's office, and I got called in while my dad was in the waiting room. When I got in the doctor was really nice, greeted me, talked to me for a bit, and made me feel pretty relaxed. I wasn't so nervous anymore, but I was dreadfully waiting for the part where I had to get on the chair completely naked. I thought I heard the doctor say something along the lines of, ""I'm going to step outside for a few minutes. There's a curtain in the back of the room where you can undress. Just hop up on the chair when you're finished, and I'll knock to see if you're ready.""  
 
I was so nervous that as soon as the doctor left I scurried behind the curtain, and started to undress. All the while I was thinking that it was weird there was a curtain I needed to change behind, when I was just going to be naked in the chair. So now I'm sitting on a cold chair, completely naked, with both feet up in the stirrups, and I hear a loud knock. I squeamishly say, ""Come in!"" The door handle turns and in walks the doctor with a look of horror on his face, as my dad is only inches behind him. For what felt like minutes they both stood in the doorway wide-eyed. It must have really only been a second or two though. I gasped, and started making incoherent noises trying to tell them to get out. My dad got a clear on view of not only my naked body, but both legs wide open. It didn't help at all that I was shaven downstairs too.  

The doctor came back in and apologized profusely. Well, It turns out that there's a paper robe dispenser behind the curtain, and you're supposed to wear the paper gown for the exam. It also turns out the doctor was going to bring my dad back to talk to the both of us about certain visits and exams my insurance plan covers. He even stated this when he left the room, but my nerves got the better of me and I didn't listen very well. The rest of the exam went well, and the ride home was painfully awkward. I still haven't really talked or made eye contact with my dad, but it will probably pass soon. It was all my fault for sure. Hopefully next time I will listen a lot better.  

Tl;Dr: Didn't listen to what my gyno doctor had to say, and ended up naked in a starfish pose for my horrified dad to see"
46nlrb,non_TBI,"Just a heads up, I wrote this last night, but couldn't post it until now. 

This week, there was a thread on /r/askreddit asking divers if they've ever masturbated during a dive. Being a curious sort, I decided today that I would get some firsthand experience and answer that thread. I am not an accredited diver, I've got a friend who has equipment who is also not an accredited diver. We know the basics from a SCUBA class we spent exactly one day in during a vacation in California. It was a three-day tourist course.

At about 10:00 PM MST, that friend and I snuck out in a boat onto the terrible, disgusting, depleted, freezing cold Bluewater Lake in NM. I realize the temperature is going to make things hard, but I wanted to jerk it underwater, and my friend was interested in knowing how it went, so with no dissenting voices it seemed like a good idea.

Equipment check was fine, probably. Suit was fine and surprisingly warm. It's measured for my friend, who is a larger fellow than I, so it's a bit loose everywhere but the hands and feet. Air wasn't 100%, but more than enough to tug one out. Temperature was GOD AWFUL but science needed to be done. Visibility, also pretty bad. We didn't bring headlamps just in case there are lake cops who want to stop us from bashing the bishop underwater. We do not come to this lake often, we do not know. Experience, ehhhh, not important. I've got a rope tied to a toolbox in the boat for tug (heh) signals and to pull my way back up with. I've got a raging hard-on and everything is okay. I dive in.

It's not bad when I get in. The wetsuit is keeping me pretty warm. I've heard about the bends so I don't go deep. I don't have one of those things that keeps track of your depth. (Is that even a thing or did I imagine it?) ANYWAY, I get deep enough that I feel satisfied with calling it a ""dive"" and not just ""I wanked in a nasty New Mexico lake with my head underwater."" I can still barely see the underside of the boat without a headlamp. Time to get to work. I open the weird hip zipper. FREEZING February water floods into the loose suit and my genitals invert themselves. I start shivering immediately, it is the most unpleasant feeling I've ever felt. BUT I AM DETERMINED. I squeeze my eyes shut, keep my feet kicking to maintain depth, and think of the hottest shit I can manage. I tug (heh) the rope under my arm cause I need both hands for this. The texture of the gloves actually helps.

Did you know it's really hard to maintain a boner in cold water? I don't know the temperature of the water I was swimming in, but it was cold enough that I would go limp the very second I stopped focusing. This happened 3 times. It's not a good feeling to go blueballs 3 times in rapid succession while your balls are probably actually turning blue from the cold. My fourth attempt is cut short when it becomes VERY hard to suck air out of the air thing. I think I'm out of fucking air. The feeling of suffocating when you're holding your breath is way more preferable to the feeling when you've emptied your lungs into the air thing and can't fill them all the way back up. I tug (heh) on the rope like it's the last thing I'll ever do. This was the only signal we had, tug like crazy if you're dying. My friend tugs (HEH) back, he's pulling me up. Suddenly cumming is the last thing I remember. It kind of hurt, like when you've overworked your bone on an off day and it's just exhausted. 

Here's what I was told happened next. I stopped tugging on the rope. Friend was pulling me up. I must have sunk deeper during my concentration cause it took longer than he expected. He pulled me up with my dick (which had experienced some... shrinkage) hanging out and my balls nowhere to be seen. He gave me CPR right there in the boat, said I didn't even cough up any water and suddenly come to and say something romantic like in the movies. I actually woke up in the car on the way to the hospital. Right now I'm in the ER for hypothermia! Did you know they give you all the coffee and hot chocolate you could possibly want? Did you know they basically force feed you godawful food bars that are just flavorless sugar and fat? The doctor is sure hypothermia made it too hard for my lungs to pull air from the tank, not that the tank was too low. They were shocked I didn't fall unconscious during the 1 hour from the middle of the lake to the hospital. Either way, I'll probably be fine once this goddamn shivering stops and my dick reappears. This is probably a really long post but writing it is all I have to do until they say I can go home. Sorry!

tl;dr: ~~tried to jerk off~~ technically jerked off underwater, ended up in the hospital.

Pre-posting update: dick is slowly re-emerging, balls still MIA.

26rq6m,non_TBI,"This monster cockroach had taken up residence in my bathroom for like the last year but whenever I tried to catch him he would always slip my grasp. About 10 minutes ago I finally corner the bastard in my wife's tampon box. I find a way to maneuver the roach into the toilet without wasting any tampons (because fuck emergency runs to the grocery store for that crap.) and a sense of victory washes over me. But is this enough for 9deep4u? Oh hell no I want this fucker to suffer. I decide I'm going to drop a load on him before I flush him, a dishonorable sendoff. So I get on the toilet and start going to work. It starts coming out and this is one solid log I had been holding on to for about half an hour (because xbox) I aim by looking through my legs, all is going well, the log is right on coarse. Eventually it makes contact, and this is when all hell breaks lose. The roach goes full rambo and climbs UP MY SHIT towards my butthole! I panic and start jumping around like a 50's housewife who just spotted a rat. Mind you my log hadn't been broken yet so I'm spreading that shit all over the bathroom in the process. Best part? The little bastard got away. Now I'm sitting on my computer procrastinating cleaning my bathroom covered in fecal matter.

356ad6,non_TBI,"Long time stalker/lurker, first time poster. 

This happened about 20/30 minutes ago. There's a girl from work I'm a bit keen on (but she's taken) and although we've probably worked near each other for a few months, we've only really been speaking the past few weeks.

During our conversation tonight, I mentioned how it'd be cool to see a really old library. Like one straight out of Victorian England. A library so old the books would disintegrate upon simply breathing on them. I then mentioned how there was nothing better than the smell of a good book. 
She agreed saying it was amazing, but a disintegrated book would be sad. But I quickly responded with sniffing one would be worst. 
Now she followed that up with it's coke for bibliophiles. To which I so boldly asked ""Is that people who like to fondle small books?""

It didn't go down too well. I quickly said I was heading to bed. Reddit, I think I fucked up...

tl:dr I made a book joke about pedophiles.

Edit: Wow did this blow up way more than I expected and I didn't even expect it.
To clear a few things up I wasn't stalking anyone :P... just Reddit... *shhh.. she at least still doesn't know...* Lurker probably was the better word, but I haven't been sleeping well that last few nights and work has been a colossal pain. 
Also I'm aware that bibliophiles is a word. I was just, as some people have said, using it because of the suffix -phile and its association with pedophiles. Sorry all you other -philiacs :(. I mean it wasn't really a joke at all. I was, as is in my fashion, just being an idiot about things. This is one of the very few times my idiocy has betrayed me. Who knew? 
This incident didn't at all happen in the workplace. It was around 11pm AEST (Sydney) using Facebook messaging.

Edit 2: Edit suffix because I can't read.

Edit 3: I'm at work so this will be short. People seem to be assuming that when I said I fucked up, I meant I missed my shot and I'm laying in wait. That's not why I felt I fucked up. I enjoy her company and I felt we'd established a solid friendship. My fuck up was that I may have fucked that friendship up."
2f8epb,non_TBI,"Surprisingly, my fuck up actually happened today.

Here's some backstory first:

My father, mother, and younger sister all got Macbook laptops a few years ago. I was the one that helped them set up their laptops and what not. I did the usual: sign them into iCloud, import some old files, download Chrome, etc. Over the years I would sometimes use their laptops whenever mine was not in reach.

8/31/14 = The Fappening

I saw a post hit the front page about nudes being revealed. I curiously scrolled through the comments and saw this glorious subreddit, /r/thefappening. As soon as I entered the subreddit I was blown away by the number of pictures posted there. I was like a kid in a candy store. So many nudes from so many famous people! I recently started college and have my own apartment, so I didn't have to worry about my family seeing my browsing history or anything. The first thing I did was bookmark the popular post of that subreddit so that I would have a bunch of famous nudes easily accessible. Then I began my journey.
Jennifer Laurence nude? *Bookmarked*.
Victoria Justice nude? *Bookmarked*.

After spending about 30 minutes in /r/thefappening, the entire top of my Google Chrome browser was packed with NSFW bookmarks. I was actually pretty proud of myself. Having the freedom to bookmark anything I wanted without my parents finding out about them was the greatest feeling ever.

**Today**
9/1/14 = The Post-Fappening

Since I had two days off due to Labor Day weekend, I decided to come home from college and pay my family a visit. I missed the first train home, but was able to take the next one and arrive just in time for dinner. 
It was odd. No one was talking at the table. My mother, my father, and my sister just looked down at their plates and ate quietly. It took about 10 minutes before my mom finally breaks the silence and asks me if I'm enjoying college. I told her how I'm enjoying the new apartment and how everything has been going well so far. 
I can tell by my mother's facial expressions that something is wrong, so I ask her what's up. She tells me that I should ""stop uploading nonsense"" on the internet and that I could be put in jail for what I did.

I was so confused at what she was trying to get at, but then my sister brought down her laptop. As soon as she opened up Chrome, my face turned bright red. It turns out that all of the bookmarks on my personal computer had Synced to every computer because of Chrome's Sync feature. In other words, Chrome had saved all of my NSFW celebrity bookmarks onto each of my family member's laptops. When my mom saw these bookmarks, she asked the rest of my family why these bookmarks were stored on her laptop. This led to some google searches concerning ""The Fappening"". Due to the abundance of celebrity nudes I had bookmarked, my mother actually thought that I was one of the ""hackers"" she read about that was responsible for uploading a massive celebrity nudes leak. 

I'm lying in bed right now trying to cool down after such an embarrassing dinner. I would like to remind everyone about the Sync settings that are on Chrome. 

*Please. Turn Them. Off.*

**TL;DR:** Chrome synced all of my ""Fappening"" bookmarks to my family's computers. Mother thought I was responsible for leaking hundreds of celebrity nudes. 

--------------------------------------------------

**EDIT:** There are a lot of questions concerning my fuck up, so I will try to answer most of them. Before I begin, keep in mind that I originally had no idea about this Cloud feature until yesterday. So people are calling me an idiot for signing into Chrome with my own account instead of using my family's accounts. I do agree that I am an idiot, but the reason why I logged into my google account on their new computers was because I had a list of family files/photos uploaded to Google Drive. I would access my own Google account, go to the files, and then download them onto their computers. After I was done with that, I would **sign out** from my Google account. People keep saying that I never signed out. I did sign out, but I guess I never knew that I had to sign out from the Sync feature on Chrome. Next, why the hell would someone bookmark nudes knowing they would get deleted? I actually didn't know they were all about to get deleted at the time. Bookmarking them was the first thing that came to mind. And for the big one, why didn't I just save them rather than bookmark them? Here I honestly don't have a straight answer, because I figured that bookmarking was no different than saving something onto your computer. Like I said, I wasn't really thinking about the nudes being deleted at the time, so I didn't think bookmarking something was so weird. In fact, I feel like bookmarking stuff is much easier than downloading, but then again that's just me.

I know I fucked up, and I'm aware of the irony here. "
2t6l8p,non_TBI,"So a little background first: I'm on my school's student council, and today was our Junior Prom assembly. We had a lot going on, much of it relying on a fast internet connection to work (live cameras streamed over AppleTV, etc.) we realized that as everyone settled into the auditorium, we'd have a large portion of the student body connecting to the school wifi, and we were worried about slowdown. Our live camera was basically useless without a good internet connection, so I had the bright idea to hook up the AppleTV to my personal hotspot. It connected automatically, I ran the feed for a few seconds, worked like a charm, so we moved on. Assembly starts, about 15 minutes in and everything is going great. I'm backstage when I see our principal run up to microphone and tell everyone to exit the school immediately, as there is a potential terror threat in the area (I live in an area where things like this never happen; we've had one lockdown in my 10 years of schooling here) obviously, everyone's more than a little worried. Everyone files out, myself included. As I'm standing outside, a friend walks up and tells us what he found out from a teacher. One of the students, while trying to connect to the wifi, had ""discovered"" a network... My network: ""Taliban Secure Communications."" needless to say, the student went to a teacher, things escalated, and the school ordered a full evacuation. I talked to the principal (a very, very awkward conversation) and got everything sorted out. Everyone's parents are panicking, checking their kids out of school now. My personal hotspot is now called ""I love school.""
TL/DR: Turned on personal hotspot with the name ""Taliban Secure Communications"" for an assembly, school got evacuated because of a supposed terror threat."
3ks2we,non_TBI,"Adam is 2 years old, he can hold the ice cream cone with confidence. It's one of the few things he enjoy and he can do it on his own. We are all sitting watching TV when Adam left the room for 2 minutes, came back with chocolate on the tip of his index finger pointing it at me saying ""Ehh daa"" which is his way for saying""What is this"" ... I thought that was chocolate from the ice cream he was eating and started to lick it ... Yup, that wasn't chocolate, it was poop ... When he left the room he put his finger in his diaper and took a very small piece of poop and came with it. I ran to the bathroom washed my teeth and mouth and the smell and taste didn't leave my mouth.

I got out of the bathroom and Adam was looking at me laughing. I now have a feeling that he did that on purpose."
2ea5h1,non_TBI,"So, this happened about 5 days ago at my girlfriends first college soccer game.  She had to sit out a good amount of the game because of a pulled quad.  Safe to say, when she came over to her family and I after the game, she was in need of a good laugh.

But first, a bit of backstory:

Her family really likes me.  But, as always in every relationship, her dad is very protective of her.  That said, he and I get along very well.  Like, really well.  We go out to lunch, talk about music and movies and watch soccer games together on TV now that my girlfriend is away (I still like to visit her family though to keep them company).  

Her mom knows that her and I have had sex, and she accepts it and she's actually really cool with it.  She told me how great it was of me to wait until her daughter was ready, not force anything, yadda yadda yadda (I was not a virgin entering this relationship, but she was).  Her dad doesn't know though.  He still thinks she is a virgin.

Anyways, everyone was very cool with me and I loved it.  

Well, I fucked that up big time at her soccer game.

So anyways, after the game she comes over and the trainer comes with her, and explains that the reason she sat out most of the game was not only because of her quad, but she was super tight *everywhere*.  Apparently, she was not in great shape and the training and practice really made her body tight.

So, me being the 18 year old smartass I am, the first thing that comes to mind is her cooter.  Her and I had not had sex for almost 3 weeks at this point because she had been suffering from a UTI and then had a very bad fever afterwards, so I can imagine it was pretty firm down there.

So, knowing my girl needed a laugh, I promptly, loudly, and idiotically, in front of her whole family and her roommates, said ""I bet I know how I can loosen at least one part of her up,"" as I winked at her family.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Instantly, my girlfriend and her roommates began laughing hysterically, her mothers face turned to a deep, deep red (like as red as a rare-cooked steak), and her dad grabbed my arms and quickly said ""Okay it's time for us to go, bye [girlfriend's name].""

The hour car ride home from her campus back to her house was probably the worst thing ever.  Ever.  It was filled with her dad screaming about how he knew I violated his daughter, I was terrible for making that joke, and he'd be surprised if I would ever see his daughter again this year.

But, hey, at least I cheered my girlfriend up.

TL;DR: Offered to stretch my girlfriend out, now I'm shunned by her family.

**EDIT:** Damn guys my second post to hit front page...second post here too.  Thanks.  Anyways, a little update, her dad apologized for going off on me.  He knew the entire time (as /u/EbilSmurfs noted).  He said he was really harsh on me for making a joke that just happened to slip out.  He said he had done a lot of stupid stuff at my age and this was just one of those things that slipped out.

Which leads to another thing, I didn't really think before saying this.  My mouth moved before my mind thought about it...and yeah it just happened.  Happens to everyone.  I thought this would amuse some people so I posted it here.

3ei1iv,non_TBI,"For as long as I can remember, mornings have been occasion for frequent intestinal distress. Nausea, cramps, the shits. I talked to my doctor a couple of different times about it and he and I seemed to agree-- a combination of anxiety and my coffee intake contributed to these unfortunate situations. It's not like I was the only one jogging to the bathroom at work in the morning. In fact, I figured that pretty much everyone was dealing with the same level of discomfort as me, with plenty of coffee and workplace stress to go around. 

But last week, I had a morning where the cramps and nausea were almost overpowering, and I barely made it in time to the porcelain throne to blow out my innards. It prompted me to reflect a little. I had not had any extra coffee that morning; in fact I had less than usual. I also didn't have any anxiety troubles like I usually do, since it was shaping up to be a pretty laid-back day at work. So what, I wondered, was different? 

There was only thing that stood out to me: I had two bowls of cereal instead of one. Upon this realization, I noticed a pattern: when I had cereal, I got sick. I made an appointment with my doctor the following week, keeping track of what I ate for breakfast along the way.

I am lactose intolerant."
2qprw5,non_TBI,"So today was my first day in work after the Christmas holidays. I knew the office would be virtually empty so I skipped the usual shirt and tie combo and dressed down, complete with a pair of shiny wood-soled brogues. 

Office is basically empty, so I drag out a few menial tasks while browsing Reddit and do whatever I can to not fall asleep. 1pm rolls round and I head out to get some lunch - first stopping at a local Boots pharmacy to pick up some essentials. 

As I'm heading out, I notice a woman approaching to enter the store. She's clearly pregnant - very large, and wearing one of those 'baby on board' badges so she'll get a seat on public transport. She's a distance away and carrying a large, full, cloth shopping bag but I caught her eye and now I feel obliged to keep the door open for her. 

Now these doors are very narrow and for whatever reason ridiculously heavy and only open inwards. So from outside I have to move right over so the wide lady can get past. I'm so far away from the door that I can only open it a few inches and it's taking all of my effort and I'm regretting all my life choices because it looks pathetic but I can't just walk away now. The woman smiles and hurries as fast as her pregnant legs can take her. 

Then I realise that I'm standing on polished marble. The sheer exertion it's taking to hold the door open a pathetic amount is causing me to slip away with increasing speed because of the stupid shoes I'm wearing. Just as she's about the get through the door my legs slip out from under me entirely and I fall into her, cracking my right knee and elbow into the floor, instinctively grabbing her bag and yanking it away causing all her groceries (mainly fruit and veg) to scatter across the ground. She asks if I'm ok but looks a little annoyed, so I apologise profusely, pick up her things and return to the office sans lunch and bruised both physically and emotionally. 

Tl;dr: Manners can often cause more problems than solutions, especially in ill-advised footwear. "
2dwve9,non_TBI,"[Click here to read the first part](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2dk3yr/tifu_by_discovering_my_vagina_nsfw/)

Armed with the [fantastic advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2dk3yr/tifu_by_discovering_my_vagina_nsfw/cjqkk7y) of [u/legauge](http://www.reddit.com/user/legauge) I set out to have a discussion with my parents yesterday (Sunday). In retrospect I should have asked redditors for suggestions of one-liners to use because going into a situation like this with a ""wing-it"" mentality meant I didn't throw in as many as I'd like to have. Nonetheless, the effect was absolutely golden. I've differentiated the people speaking via formatting so that it's easier to follow the conversation.

* *Mother*
* **Father**
* ***Me***

I showed up at my folks place to make a surprise lunch for them while they were away at mid-day mass. About 10 minutes after my parents got home we were sitting down to fresh plates of grilled salmon over sauteed snow peas. I found a prime opportunity to sneak in a curveball when my mother decided to get witty about the meal. ""*So why salmon? We would have been just as surprised by pizza.*"" 

The response struck me like a bolt of lightning. ""***I guess it's just a kick I'm on; it's really healthy. I found a great price and amazing recipes - I just can't get enough of it. It's like pink meat is just a part of me.***"" My father chuckled half to himself while my mom leveled a strange look at me. It was like she wanted to laugh but couldn't; she was obviously flabbergasted and caught off-guard (which I've never even HEARD of happening to her). She looked at my dad who simply shrugged and smiled back, then turned to her plate. After the most awkward silence I'd ever seen my family experience the conversation picked back up and we finished dinner.

My parents offered to do the dishes while I cleaned up the grill. After a bit my father came outside and, in silence, produced from his shirt pocket a joint rolled with the immacuate form only 40+ years of practice can achieve. It was a piece of art and something I never thought I'd see again. He'd stuck solely to a vaporizer and edibles since he quit smoking a decade ago, yet here he was sparking a jay. After a long drag he bumped me in the shoulder with the back of his hand. I took the flaming sculpture, pinched the joint in my lips, and inhaled slowly and deeply while I put the grill back together. I passed it back and exhaled while I rinsed my hands with the hose.

He knew I knew. I knew he knew I knew. We simply sat in silence and smoked. Without a single word an understanding resonated between us; anything I needed to ask he would answer. Anything I wanted to say he would listen to. As the roach dwindled and my dad snubbed it out, he looked over his glasses and made direct eye contact with me. ""**Take it easy on your mom, okay? This is a tough one for her.**""

I thought for a moment and placed my hand on his shoulder, ""***Don't worry, Dad... in regards to harsh sentiment my lips are sealed.***"" I busted out my biggest :D face at the end and he laughed hysterically as we walked into the house, where we were greeted by pistachio ice cream over peach cobbler with accompanying snifters of brandy. I remarked that how I am not a fatty mcfatfat after so many of my mom's desserts I'll never know.

""***Oh peaches,***"" I said to my plate as I sat down to the table again, ""***it's like you're calling to some deep, secret place within me!***"" My dad glanced in my direction as if to indicate I was laying it on a little thick, but the comment seemed to fly over my mom's head entirely. Following dessert and a few more rounds of brandy at my father's urging, we decided to play some cribbage. By this time the alcohol was taking effect, and my normally straight-laced businesswoman mother was getting into her boisterous, relaxed state. It's a side of her I never got to see while I was growing up, so it's always a treat when she gets the giggles.

Early in the game she had a HUGE lead. My father and I were pretty much tied while she was over 30 points ahead after the first five hands. ""*You guys need to step it up,*"" she said smugly while shuffling the cards, ""*it's like you're just giving this game away.*"" My father turned to me and said, ""**You heard your mother. Time to actually start playing.**"" I smiled and winked. ""***I don't know that I can stop her. It's like I'm just bleeding peg points from a mysterious gaping hole!***"" My dad's eyes widened and he sat up straight in his chair, then looked over at my mom who was slapping the table while laughing. ""*Don't worry, son,*"" she said while catching her breath, ""*God loves you no matter HOW many holes you have!*"" My face turned red and I said a thank you to the ceiling [I'm agnostic] while my parents looked at each other with a knowing snicker. My father nudged my leg under the table and nodded at me.

After we finished up the game - plus a few more - the sun was low in the sky. The porch was lit with colors from the western stained glass windows; a mural of a forest clearing, given as a gift from one of my mom's friends. My parents snuggled on the porch swing and planned the next day's events with one another while I lounged in an old crushed leather chair and took a few relaxed drags from my pipe. I was starting to question whether or not I should stay the course. After all, this wasn't some kind of devastating revelation to me and what really could be gained from potentially disrupting my family's chill dynamic?

There was a break in my parents' conversation as my dad left to go to the bathroom. ""*So, AmBee,* [used in place of my IRL nickname] *what do you have planned for this week? Anything noteworthy or are you just enjoying the down time between writing projects?*"" My mother had a warm smile and sincere interest. How could I make such an important person in my life uncomfortable? I decided in this moment that I wasn't going to tell her about my discovery. There would be plenty of other, better opportunities in the future. ""***Actually, Mom, this last week was pretty intense. I'm just going to enjoy a bit of downtime. I should be heading out soon though, I'm sure I've bothered you and Dad enough for one day.***""

""*Nonsense. You know we love when you visit. So what happened this week? Did you meet a ~giiiirl~?*"" Her mocking emphasis made me blush. ""***Something like that,***"" I replied, ""***it's more like I got reacquainted with an old friend.***"" She straightened herself on the porch swing. ""*Oooo, tell me more... is she someone your father and I know?*"" ""***You could say that,***"" I chuckled, ""***But I know it's going to become a long conversation and I really need to get going.***"" My dad came back in and sat down next to my mom. ""**What did I miss?**""

""*Oh, nothing much. Your son is teasing me with information*"" she replied, ""*I just want him to tell me how his week went and he's being a real PUSSY about it.*"" I had never heard her use that word in my entire life and I never thought I would, owing to her feminist ideology. I looked on in disbelief while my parents laughed, high-fived each other, then looked in my direction. Then it dawned on me - she was aware of what I'd been trying to do. ""***So how long have I been on the hook?***""

""*Since your first crack about the salmon. Your father and I talked about it while we did dishes, before he went out to smoke with you. Did you really think you'd be able to play a joke on the people who taught you your sense of humor?*"" My face turned beet red and I smiled at my father ""***Thanks for setting me up, Dad.***"" He stood and bowed, still laughing.

A looooong talk followed and some notable chunks of information came to light. There was never any reassignment surgery and the extra bits are where they are by nature. Additionally, it's all extremely underdeveloped and non-functional; we're talking roughly 4-6"" from the vaginal entrance in my rectum to the terminal end of what would be a sort of proto-uterus. I guess it's all mashed up in there and kind of a mess, so my hopes of having things redirected and potentially usable are entirely dashed. There are no ovaries, which I strongly suspected from the get-go. All the ladyparts I have occupy a volume roughly equivalent to a few golf balls. My parents knew about this ever since I was four years old, and were surprised that I don't remember my first ""big"" visit to the doctor. I had managed to wedge a LEGO piece up in my snizz while visiting my cousins and had to go see the doctor. He wanted to excise the defunct sex organs, but my parents (rightfully, IMO) decided not to go that route.

So now we come to why I wasn't told. I still have mixed feelings about being kept in the dark, but I totally understand why it was done and harbor no resentment whatsoever. It was due to a ""perfect storm"" of factors, really. First and foremost I was raised in a small midwestern town and if the (pussy) cat got out of the bag it would have lead to utter social ostracism for the entire family. My folks are also prominent church members, and while their parish has become quite progressive over the years thanks to their influence this kind of thing would have gone over like a lead balloon in the 80's. It also would have had repercussions on my mom's business career; she has had to fight tooth and nail (and still does) against cultural stigma regarding working women and having an intersexed child would most certainly have been used against her. There is simply no way she'd have been allowed to rise to prominence in the business world.

My parents had many talks with each other over the years about telling me but always decided against it. They felt that it would impact the way in which my sexual and gender identity naturally developed, and I have to admit they are right about that. I'm actually very appreciative of this motivation as it shows their respect for the idea that I am my own person. It was always agreed that when the time came and I asked about it they would be totally open and honest with me - but my folks were certainly surprised that it took this long to discover. They initially thought that I'd known for a while and just FINALLY brought it up.

So, that's pretty much that. My parents are funding a visit to a specialist later this week and from there I get to decide what happens next. Since the angles and orientation of everything result in an extremely low chance of complications or infection there really isn't a need for concern if I simply leave it alone, but it's not really something I can ""get all up in"" and still maintain the sanitation integrity. Part of me wants to have the opening surgically sealed simply to avoid any potential problem in the future, while part of me just wants to leave it be. Regardless of which direction I ultimately go, my vagina will always be a part of me. It doesn't define or diminish my existence any more than it ever has, but this whole experience has resulted in a greater degree of self-awareness which I will value for the rest of my life.

EDIT: I really enjoy responding to as many comments as I can before I get sick of it, but it seems there's a bit of a brigade taking advantage of this and downvoting everything I write. Even my comments from months ago are getting downvoted. I appreciate the well-wishing and comments about my parents being cool (as will they when I tell them) but am probably going to stop responding to every single one in order to prevent further arming the angries.

EDIT 2: Once again, [Cyae1 decided to narrate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9NmBmWx2TA&list=PLl0DkyQa9Aqu_aWjvjzvySIZC8PHUPPO6&index=45)"
21eeu7,non_TBI,"So I spend a lot of time in compression shorts, because I play sports, and work out at the gym. Today I had to do some errands after going to the gym so it took me a while to get to a shower, which bugs me because I have a fear of getting jock itch...It isn't something you want to deal with twice. So I was anxious to get out of the tight, dirty compression shorts and have a nice shower to keep my lil' guys out of harm's way. 

So I finally got home, took a shower, got all squeaky clean and everything, but I had to go the extra step. I wanted to be as dry as could be, for the sake of my nads, in the resistance of jock itch. So I decided to take my Vornado fan, crank it to the max, and let my junk flap in the wind like a flag on a windy day. The only catch is that my fan has no cover on it anymore...I was getting a little bored, so I switched the fan to my left hand and started checking my phone  with my other hand, and slowly I let the Vornado drift towards the danger zone.

All of a sudden, my dick gets snagged in between the blades. It must have done at least three full circulations with the fan before I could let go. You literally could have done jump rope with my dick. I uttered some horrible squeal, dropped the fan right on my toe. The fan shattered. I fell to the ground. My mom rushed into my room to see me crumpled up on the ground naked with my dick throbbing the color of a hotdog. I am still mentally recovering.

tl;dr: Tried to dry my nuts off with a fan after a shower. Dick turned into    a mini jump rope by getting stuck in the fan blades. Then my mom saw me naked."
2ly9tn,non_TBI,"So here's a wee story that might make your mornings as you all crawl to work-

I'm a male nurse and last night I was working in a geriatric ward, as the shift began we took down all the info of our patients. 

So there was this bariatric patient (medical term for morbidly obese) and she was something of an old Madame that is to say, she was rather used to bring waited on hand on foot and nothing less prior to entry of our hospital- she had raised a stink two days previous about losing track of objects such as a glass eye of hers, hairbrush and money etc.(a characteristic fairly common with patients suffering from dementia) and I didn't think too much on the subject.

So my round was fairly regular, did everything by the book and at 7am for some ungodly reason the manager insisted that the night staff starts bed-washing the patients and guess who I got landed with? You guessed it: the bariatric Madame. 

Since she was bariatric and had some fairly common respiratory issues for elderly people she was pretty poor at mobilising so I thought ""righty well I'll get her on her chair and wash her there with a basin"" chatting away and keeping the conversation light as I can't imagine this would be an altogether pleasant experience for her: being washed by an ingratiatingly twee plucky young male nurse who had to be as camp as tits about the whole affair (a foul habit I fall into to put female patients at ease with my overbearing manliness)

Anyway, I clean her face, scrub her front, arms and legs (no easy feat as she weighed roughly 378lbs and I weigh 140lbs) she murmurs embarrassedly that she feels her bottom needs a bit of a clean- now when you've been in the game as long as I have this isn't an issue at all because, hey, it's just another human body and the only requirement is that I need to be exceedingly gentle and exceptionally professional about the whole affair.

So I get Madame to stand up in her zimmer with the chair right behind her at her knees so she doesn't fall and hurt herself (having a crap respiratory system, even the slightest acts of movement can really leave patients like that super breathless)

So I start to scrub her deep dark crevice and I do it thoroughly as any good nurse would, as I reach somewhere down there I feel a slight protuberance which, hey gross as it sounds: isn't uncommon, so I dig a little deeper clawing in to get this little wedge of presumed filth out and do my duty to maintain health and hygiene... and lo and behold: a bloody glass eye falls out!

In a state of pure bewilderment I cry out loud ""WHAT THE?! CAN SOMEONE GET IN HERE NOW!!!"" As the glass eye bounces out to my feet (how would you react if you saw an eyeball dropping out of someone's bum?)

Unfortunately for me this shocked the old dear so much she loses balance and falls back onto her chair: my arm experiences the unforgiving crushing power of a 90 year old arse that weighs just over 378lbs. Because of this my body loses any balance or prepotency over what it does and I twat my forehead off the wooden armrest of her chair and I'm stuck there as she begins to enter a state of mortification and horror at the real life ramifications of her- shall we say: gratuitous physique damn near hospitalising this poor nurse... 

Finally my screams for help are heard from my colleagues who find my recumbent body facedown and locked into submission in this... shall we say... predicament, they manage to relinquish my arm from the vast, unloving depths of her gooch-cum-buttocks and I spent the remaining hour of my shift in the emergency room to get an X-ray (my arms fine, just a little squished and strained) however I'm never working in that ward ever again."
2ish8k,non_TBI,"A while back I got hot pepper juice on my finger tips. Obviously I was super careful not to touch my eyes until a long, long hand washing. I went about my night eating the delicious chili I had made and watching some netflix. My without the wife being home was going fantastic.

Then I got an itch on my balls. Not a normal itch, mind you, one of those ""Oh, I'm gonna have to go inside the pants to get this taken care of"" itches. I put down my spoon and reached into my pajama pants. MMMMmmmm. That's the ticket. ""Itch handled"" I thought to myself. Then a small twinge of pain. Then the burning started.

I realized at that very second that I had neglected to clean the pepper acid from under my nails. It. Burned.

I jumped up and stripped naked. Not just taking off my PJ bottoms, everything had to go. I grabbed my desk fan, flicked it on and pointed it at my scrotum. The cool breeze did nothing.

My brain was racing, I was beginning to cry a little. I thought back to the last time I had my mouth burning up from hot peppers. MILK!!

I ran into the kitchen, buck naked, and grabbed a bowl. Opening the refrigerator, I discovered we were out of milk. All hope was lost until I remembered the baby formula can in the cabinet! It's pretty much milk right! So I fill the bowl with cold water and formula powder.

The front door opens. My wife walks in to find me naked and crying on the kitchen floor with my balls marinating in a bowl of baby formula."
