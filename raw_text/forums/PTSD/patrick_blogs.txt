I am fairly certain that I have PTSD. Do I need to see a Psychiatrist before I file a claim or can I rely on the C&P examiner to give me a rating. My private insurance will not pay for treatment and or a diagnosis of this type of illness. Our local V.A. clinic is very small in my town and I would have to travel a very long distance to get to the V.A. regional center in my state.

I just received my claim for increase in compensation and now I'm scared shitless.

I went from 30% to 100%. I was NOT expecting this much of an increase. I figured 50-70% at the most which more than likely would have bumped my overall percentage to 100%... which would have been ok as far as I have been able to tell from what I'm reading on here.

What does this mean though?
Is it bad?
Does it mean I can't be employed?
Does it mean I won't be able to keep/hold a security clearance?

I'm totally freaked out. I keep hearing different things about what 100% PTSD actually means.

I sure as hell want to get a job and work... if 100% means I'm unemployable then I'm screwed.

I recently battled the va for a back injury, PTSD, and several other issues. After months of fighting the va finally brought my claim to an end.
I was giving two service connected disabilities... a back injury and ptsd. However they gave me a zero percent raiting for each one. Is this even legal.
Can the VA honestly and lawfuly say we messed you up and broke you but we are not going to pay for it. I have been refused several jobs because of my physical limits and I can't remember when the last time i had a decent nights rest was. Any reliable advice would be greatly appreciated.

Just found yor site, looks friendly and informative.

I just finished my C&P exams last week for PTSD, Hearing loss, Tinituus and an upgrade on Sinusitis that I have at 10% currently.
The PTSD is Service connected to Viet Nam by Documentation.

The C&P's went very well. The Doc said I hit ALL the targets for PTSD. I never knew there was such a thing til the VA Clinic said I had it and started all this. I am not sure what to expect for a rating on PTSD.
The Hearing part went well too. The Doc said I had 'Substantial Hearing Loss' which is common for long term Sinusitis.
It all looks good for a higher rating, but, what maybe?
I filed a FOIA for the C&P reports but have not recieved them yet.
Is there anyway to guesstimate my new rating?
I was thinking 50% for PTSD, 20% for Hearing and 20% for Sinusitus and 10% Tinitus. Probably a total of 70% with the VA fuzzy math? Is this a reasonable to assumtion?

I'm an Iraq Vet, and there are no group meetings or therapy groups in which to exchange info, which is why I'm on here - I took my WWII Vet Father in today for C&P for PTSD, and there are all these "Nam Vets waiting for some group meeting and they all had matching PDA and were tapping away or listening to tunes. I asked one of them if it was some kind of research thing or something. He said no, that it was issued by the VA so they could keep track of appointments, etc. - Then he tells me, "Oh yeah, and several of us have PTSD dogs too - and I put in for a new set of golf clubs" - muttered something about enhancing life quality or something.... and then he got called into the meeting so I couldn't find out who to contact regarding any of this stuff. Is there a certain level of PTSD before you get any of this?

Hi

I applied for PTSD compensation with VA after coming back from Iraq and just got a letter from them today saying that they denied my claim and explained that i have anxiety disorder and not PTSD and therefore I do not qualify for compensation. However after applying for compensation and seeking help at the VA clinic I was told that they were backed up for several months ahead and I would have to wait or I could participate in a PTSD study that VA was conducting and for participation I would be provided help as needed without any wait time. So ofcourse I agreed to do the study because I wanted to get some help. The study was held at the VA hospital where I went through a bunch of tests and they determined that I have PTSD and suggested that I attend classes that they offer which teach people to deal with this type of thing. So I did. So VA doctors diagnosed me with PTSD, but my PTSD claim was denied? That makes no sense to me. I mean, I spend a year in a combat zone, I provided them a letter with stressors, which they asked for, and on top of that a VA doctor diagnosed me with PTSD. What should I do?

If anyone knows anything about these things I would apreciate any kind of input.

I am currently in the National Guard and am trying to get a Line of Duty form completed from my time in Iraq (2003-2004) for PTSD. I am then going to attempt to go before the active duty MEB to get medical retirement. I am looking to see if any one else has dealt with this situation.
